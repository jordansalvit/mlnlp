-fdWy2YBR0mrSWyqo0OapA CMU I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend for dinner We decided to come here after randomly seeing it featured on a repeat of Guy Fieri s Diners Drive Ins And Dives earlier in the week The outside is not too much to look at but the inside is comfortable Appropriately we were seated right underneath a Guy Fieri poster that proclaimed that the Veal Parmigiana as big as yer head As you would expect with food that large it seemed that everyone that was leaving the restaurant had a to go box We knew from the episode that they make their wedding soup from scratch daily and so started off with a cup of that It had a good taste to it and had much more chicken flavor than most wedding soups that I have had in the past The escarole as a green was also pretty nice For my entree I decided on having the Veal Parmigiana sandwich as I wanted to see how big it actually was while my girlfriend decided upon the lasagna Both portions were quite large with the sandwich being as large as advertised and I have a picture to prove it It actually ended up being so big that I could not possibly fit my mouth around it So I ended up taking off the top which essentially made it into two open faced sandwiches The bread was crispy while the veal was fried nicely and the sauce and cheese complimented the rest nicely My only complaint with it is that it was a bit dry and I think that some more sauce could have been helpful with that Even so the half of the sandwich that I ate tasted good My girlfriends lasagna also seemed to be a super sized portion as it filled up her whole plate It had a lot of ricotta cheese in it which helped to give it an overall flavor that I enjoyed Like almost everyone else that I saw we ended up leaving with some to go boxes as I still had half of my sandwich left and my girlfriend half of her lasagna The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future It was a cool little place in which you definitely get a huge portion size for your money and the food is pretty good too 
-hFPrtyQwS-yEkrojuao3Q CMU This little bar and grill makes me want to move to Pittsburgh so bad I ve been here twice Once in 2009 and again in 2011 and the food and booze always makes me happy Both of my visits were for the Pittsburgh Bacon Bash and of course I ate tons of bacon things but I also grabbed a few items from the amazing menu of humorously named entrees and appetizers My favorite app was the bacon chicken wings which were lightly battered and bathed in BaconSalt and then topped with crumbled bacon awesomeness With a big bacon bloody mary it s the perfect meal I also had The Central Park The Old Fashioned Hog Heaven the Bacontini a few cosmos of greatness and a lot of great local beer For such a small place the beer options are great While the prices were a bit high 12 for some of the drinks compared to anything near me the quality and quantity both make it worth the bucks I also played What s Up Pussycat on the jukebox 10 times in a row and made a lot of people laugh hysterically 
-p6D-iXzxQjMRlRSLmIZLg CMU Food is solid especially for a place whose main focus is on being a bar and a see and be seen spot Pleasantly surprised by very good prompt and friendly service Wouldn t go here as a destination for a meal but when you re on Walnut and aren t up for the usual bar fare or one of the more upscale places it s a good compromise with reliably decent to very good food 
-tnqO9J1PuBAt_2T2Zu2tA CMU Hemingway s is good at what it intends to do get college students drunk The drink selection is pretty terrible unless you like discount shots with no top shelf liquor and mediocre at best draft choices I never went here much as an undergrad and I only go now before 9pm and only for the exceptional grilled cheeses they have a great variety and all are made with thick Italian bread If you work in Oakland you can t beat a delicious non chain restaurant sandwich for 5 99 7 99 
-_rPf-j0Fy2kP2LMCRWyBA CMU Really nothing special to this place except the outside seating they have in the summer Recently came here and my friend ordered a Coors Light draught wimp i know but it tasted absolutely awful Don t know if it was the keg that was bad or the hoses that hook up to the keg that need to be cleaned Next I got a Turkey Rachel Probably one of the most flavorless sandwiches I ve ever had The only thing I could really taste was the rye bread it was on which was quite good My friend got the veggie powerhouse salad He did seem to enjoy that I had a bite as well and I will say not bad Overall service was super slow I don t think I ll be back for a meal anytime soon It s just too mediocre to waste your time money or calories here 
03_nKqlRhIrTWW7AoRX4zw CMU I eat at Harris all the time I don t even MEAN to I just happen to end up here a lot I think it s because it s the kind of place that lots of people can agree on pretty good food and drinks and a KILLER patio For me the patio kicks it up from 4 to 5 stars in the winter they don t serve lunch In the summer this place is hoppin all the time and yes I m that jerk hogging a giant table waiting for my friends to show up they re just PARKING speaking of parking don t park in the lot next door you WILL get towed None of the other reviews mentioned yet that they recently changed the menu one of the great new additions is the BBQ pork sandwich I love it in slider form get the coleslaw with it and stick it on the sando delish I don t even LIKE coleslaw including on a primanti s bros sando so you know it s good The mac and cheese add the andouille sausage is a staple and you can get a mini version as a side to an entree for just a little extra Another new addition is the chicken fried bacon yes you read that correctly It is a hearty plate of bacon that is battered and fried and comes with white gravy I ve shared it 3 times with friends and each time it s been a little different but also kind of left me a little queasy although with a happy novelty food feeling I would definitely not recommend one person trying to eat this unless they were trying to commit suicide by bacon which I also don t recommend and I LOVE bacon Overall I love this place and I don t think the drinks are more expensive than most of the other places on Ellsworth half price frozen cosmos are definitely worth it Service is also usually great 
04GYPYEv7f8dwsY0uNF7rg CMU Reasonable priced draft beers They have Arrogant Bastard Ale on tap which makes my husband very happy Good service Bathrooms are fairly clean for a bar 
0cW18BIMR23_F-oDOpJ4-A CMU I love Big Jim s It s honestly my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh The portions are huge the food is delicious and the price is good I ve had the lasagna several times and it has never disappointed Seriously the portion is huge The servers are always friendly and attentive I ve never had a bad experience at this restaurant 
0FkIKjtHqpWF5GQpSdEEIg CMU Beer selection is incredible considering Oakland is dominated with macrobrew American adjunct lager bars Burgers are excellent Also recommend the Roll a fatty The ceilings are tall and voices echo like you re in a cave It can get very loud in this place 
0Gmgv-gsz3tbn2qArkSz1Q CMU Fuel and Fuddle has my favorite wings of all time I love the hottest ones I eat lots of spicy food and these are the only that are both tasty and spicy Great beer selection I love the alligator stew and waffle fries especially Only problems with F F is how crowded it gets how loud it gets and that it s in Pittsburgh 
0l1OqNI9ryRtrHTV2o3Rnw CMU The bartender at this bar was so incredibly rude to us that we left before ordering anything The fully story can be found here http livingaustria wordpress com 2011 12 01 phi stands for pub house of insolence I will NEVER return to this bar and HIGHLY recommend NOT going here to anyone else I would give this bar zero stars if that were possible 
0YnMEx3SkPU490WbQoBFBg CMU Had the reuben which was good and big enough for two Will try the veal parmagian sandwich next time 
0Z4DIDSQ0Z6eOK5-JoOo6w CMU Came here a lot during my CMU days Good beer selection and yummy pizzas and there s a half off menu after 11pm 
1bGx71p0QqntqjuGzKngIg CMU Good homestyle American fare High quality ingredients well prepared Liked the new gourmet sides of loaded potatoes and Mediterranean green beans I think the quarter dark plate with 2 sides is pretty good especially if you use one of the free soft drink or 1 coupons in the paper or from their website Service was good and restaurant super clean when I went Oh yeah pretty cool to get real plates and silverware when dining in 
1i4yPs9FISXxN_lZTfgWPA CMU I m a bit surprised the rating consensus isn t higher To me this is the quintessential college bar and one of the best meals in Oakland I love the Turkey Burger the beef is good too with their french fries and a tall glass of lemonade They have excellent drink prices and have some city fame for their wine specials However these deals also forced all these stipulations on the menu about loitering how long you can stay things amounts of you money you should spend etc That s a turn off The menu is simple but pleases all The inside and small outside seating areas are cozy I love going here a few times a year and I wish there was a steady twin in Philadelphia 
1McP5CGQN2A8zJzMg8ec4Q CMU Hey super savers Food shots candy necklaces Cheap slim vundabar bar is not German b 
1_TNLqCAB5YZvtUDRiTddw CMU I went here expecting the worst and was pleasantly surprised the place is funky Expect huge portions of cheap fairly good although on the greasy side food Bring your apetite The calzone is big enough to feed four for dinner easily Salad was okay and the salmon sandwich was better than expected but not great Next time I crave some hearty food I ll probably come back and get a pizza or calzone 
29cyhIDiIMCZY-NewHfgDg CMU This is one of my go to lunch spots in Shadyside The food and service is consistent and they have a great beer selection This is a great place to come and watch a game You can usually find a seat even when everywhere else is packed because it is not the typical sports bar It is also a good spot to grab bite late night I came here today and ordered the Tijuana Tuna this is the only place I will order a tuna sandwich from and it comes with hot peppers that add a bit of kick to the traditional tuna as well as a sweet honey sauce that compliments the spiciness perfectly The honey sauce also goes great with the chips Today I tried a bite of the Chicken and Spinach Panini as well and it was equally as appealing it will probably be what I order next time 
2OiB3PRkovFTTcQlvEYqDQ CMU Went to Big Jim cause Guy went there before and there is not too much individual diner on yelp close by Ok the let s go have a average expectation Guy s recommendation bottom line is edible and sometimes have surprise but not this time Atmosphere is good like an average diner but places is not clean carpet smells and table is sticky that s ok food should be good Me and my wife order the Steak Hoagie comes with salad and the Spaghetti and meat sauce with 2 meat ball extra Salad came first it is a mix wit shredded iceberg lettuce grape style tiny tomato some purple cabbage with home salad dressing Lettuce is DARK BAD and MUSSY since I was on vacation I worry I had stomach ache so I skip it The Steak Hoagie for five buck I give a 2 thumbs up bread is soft hot and toast on spot although the mayo on the sandwich is quite a bit the outcome balance the steak with fresh sliced tomato some shredded iceberg lettuce then question coming how come the salad iceberg lettuce are so sucks pls prepare as per order instead it is not a fast food joint Last and I never come back is the meat ball the Spaghetti and meat sauce I don t know how to describe how could it be like this I am pretty sure Guy s taste bud is excellent no doubt but this is too much and hit my bottom line for food spaghetti is ok not too soggy just a little more watery About the meat sauce is ok but taste like can sauce and fresh tomato and shredded meat mix together still ok edible I will give a pass BUT THE MEAT BALL OMG taste like 1 it is mussy pretty bland 2 it taste weird then I try to smells it OMG I threw all of them on the plate it smells like shit it either over cook or something wrong At the end of today I did went to washroom 2 times I am pretty sure I will not come back 
2ym-eeiBpKub6lmzdovd7Q CMU Nice selection of items good pricing and friendly atmosphere We ll be back 
32GjJfEmo9IYikCoL_4hxA CMU Wasn t that hungry and was looking for a good places for alcohol and appetizers and stumbled upon Harris Fun times NICE Unique selection of beers I m no expert but I hadn t heard of 3 4 of them and the waiter recommended a tasty blueberry one Decent spicy mussels Not the best I ve ever had but be honest with yourself you re not going to find awesome seafood in Pittsburgh Wasn t rubbery at all and the sauce was nice Tasty perfectly sized bite sized cheeseburger appetizers Wings that weren t too greasy yet very flavorful We were there for bacon night Who would have thought eating strips of plain ol bacon would be good It is Nice patio Not too packed so you can talk yet busy enough that you feel like you re part of the action Friendly attentive helpful waiter WEIRD Took forever to get drinks and food My coworker said the wings weren t legit jerk chicken like advertised The patio was a little too romantic Meaning it was so dark I couldn t read the menu except by holding it up to the little candle at our table Ditto when we went inside for a bit Maybe that d be awesome if I was on a sexy date instead of with two coworker dudes I wasn t All in all I d come back if I was looking for a date place to have a light dinner or a place to chill with some close friends 
344x0dQQGm8j-hP0x5OYsQ CMU Good burgers and mac cheese 
3cL1VzM07QxyBKXRcxrITA CMU I ve never been to F F for the late night half price food but have been there a couple times for dinner and drinks The beer selection is awesome I personally love the fire baked brie which comes out nice and warm and has honey drizzled all over it When you cut the breading the cheese just melts out I m a big fan of the Porky s Revenge Pizza and the Filler Up pizza The burgers are decent and I usually get the sweet potato fries with them because they are so much better than regular fries Overall a good place to eat If you do want to go for half price late night special make sure you get there early because there is usually a line outside 
3c_6OguTwKChp_4j4mU_QQ CMU I feel like I have to say Every time I get a sandwich here now that I know to ignore the rotisserie chicken it is completely awesome We had a bit of a weird waitress last time we were there though 
3FjYs5JCeCvCSIZ2xJgQbw CMU Awesome place Small friendly super cheap and super big portions The appetizer eggplant is large enough to serve as a meal with some left over for tomorrow s lunch 
3gv9LKjWMZbRJZIeGisFrg CMU They changed the menu up a lot recently taking some of my favorites off of it though they claim that I can still get it by ordering the specific ingredients It s not the same Downstairs has normal tables upstairs is a bar they claim the downstairs is open til 9pm every day but they usually close it by 7 Upstairs you can order off the menu til 11 and it s 21 after 10 They have pool and darts but it s not great for atmosphere 
3HYelLNiRYkGOyMlr41B2g CMU I used to be a regular at Harris Grill until I moved a bit further away but I still try to return for the I Can Haz Bacon Cheesburger and Bacon night Where else can you go on a Tuesday and order a side of bacon with your meal While Harris isn t the only place in Pittsburgh where you can get your drinks delivered to you by a cute hipster waitstaff it certainly has one of the widest best beer selections in the city I ve also heard tell that the frozen cosmos are quite good 
3IFiQt5xjSfFmtmz86B9Gg CMU A Shadyside staple this place is great for lunch while shopping Walnut dinner or late night Last night my friends and I stopped here and it was at it s usual capacity upstairs and downstairs with decent music playing It s a good local bar nothing too crazy going on and good for a final stop before heading home 
3Nhj2XcR1OJCnN9aPIY3HA CMU Ahh PHI bar my bar A true dive bar with a mix of locals and CMU kids slumming it together and sometimes to hilarious effects The beer is cheap the pizza greasy and the fries crunchy I love the specials such as 4 Yuengling pitchers on Thurs and 6 Blue Moon pitchers on Wednesday The pints aren t too expensive either especially the Yuengling The bar tenders can seem a bit cold until you start chatting them up and then they give you all sorts of under the counter specials Be wary of Friday nights which is 1 well drinks and the place resembles the black hole of Calcutta with beggars traded out for frat boys in polos and flip flops The minimum for credit cards is 10 but there is an ATM around the corner so never fear and I always order more than that anyway 
3Td3gFki2Ii2Ex-ysM9FKA CMU Massive servings friendly folks First timer Decent meal all around I had the Reuben one of my favorite sandwiches so I had to try it here Great big tasty bread toasted not grilled yummy kraut and cheese But the corned beef well they didn t cook it there Must have come in with the rest of the cold cuts Not the reubens I m used to I will come by for the veal parm though There s enough quality to bring me back 
3vOiSrk0zVvzdQMMzjHM8w CMU I ve been in Pittsburgh this past weekend for the first time in four years so my two visits to the Harris Grill recently were the only ones I ve made since it burned down a few years back Prior to that I lived in Pittsburgh and ate at the Harris Grill at least a couple times each month Fortunately not much has changed in the time I ve been gone Sure there are a few new things on the menu and some of the old items are gone but as always the draft beer list rocks the servers are awesome the food is fantastic and the clientele is fabulous I think my girlfriend and I broke open the front porch for the year on Friday as we sat alone in the chill Spring afternoon eating amazing hummus and drinking beers and cocktails We won t be back again at least until the end of June so Harris employees please keep the seats warm and the beer cold 
3yJl6ugFOEAOOSKTP3lFiw CMU I loved this place amazing pizzas great drinks good atmosphere Until I experienced an incident involving a mouse We had paid our bill and were just waiting to leave when a mouse suddenly scurried across the window sill above our booth and across to where my friends were sitting We all flew up and out of the booth in reaction to this Our waitress came over to ask what happened and we told her Her reaction was slow She casually walked back to get the manager All he did was say he was sorry No refund or anything was offered and I felt like I was being interrogated to find out where the mouse was This was the worst experience ever at what used to be one of my favorite places to go and I will never return 
4-0zX-NeCzfEx-CvULPUdQ CMU Union Grill gives Tessaro s a run for it s money for the best burger crown On the short strip of shops on Craig St Union Grill stands out It is a neighborhood restaurant very American food It isn t healthy not even the salads but that s what makes it good The service is what you expect nothing great but I haven t encountered a rude waiter During lunch expect a wait and it to take a while to get your food the grill gets crowded If you do get a reservation it is kind of annoying but they will not seat you until everyone is there so make you are prepared for that 
4IkkgsZ84G-XelAImrKa-A CMU Quite possibly my favorite place in the entire United States It s unfortunate it has to be in Pittsburgh PA but that s part of what makes it awesome in it s own way I am giving this place the honor of my very first Yelp review even though I have not lived in Pittsburgh for more than a year This place has amazing American pub food The nachos are piled high with an indeterminable amount of good toppings The buffalo wings and other kinds of wings are large properly covered in sauce and perfectly spicy But the best food here are the pizzas The Flying Buffalo the Garden of Eden et al No matter what mood you are in there s an awesome personal pizza to be had As if the food wasn t enough they have probably the best not the largest the best beer selection in Pittsburgh House brews and Great Lakes from Cleveland Guinness Yeungling all on tap More than 50 others in bottles At decent prices too Almost all food is half off after 11PM every night which is key On Saturdays the house blues man Don Sjzeck plays his awesome mix of Johnny Cash Greatful Dead blues and rock covers as well as his fun sing along original stuff It made every Saturday night awesome for me Hangover Breakfast on Sunday mornings is great for its stated purpose Unlimited coffee bloody marys etc Do what you need to do and go there one night It s worth it and its an awesome Pittsburgh experience 
4nfBLAKe_lAONd6CcsTMiw CMU Sometimes I don t know how to feel about the Union Grill it really varies on my experience but overall the food is very good They seem like they CONSTANTLY change the menu but in general is very traditional american food The service here is typically very poor and they almost seem annoyed when you ask for accommodations like large parties Don t even try to seat with less than everyone in your party they won t let you Even if you have something like 9 of 10 I despise going here with more than 1 other person 
4qKzsQpfn4pPXjreFNrvyQ CMU hmm first review on yelp unfortunately it s not the best so I LOVE PDC I used to come here a lot over the past few years because I love the food and the atmosphere it s very casual and just what you d want from a deli bar in the burgh But they recently changed ownership They renovated the interior so it s a lot shinier but no more of that real casual homey feel that gave it its charm But the worst is that they CHANGED THE MENU Their old items were so good I don t know why they would But no more hummus philly cheese steaks curly fries chicken wraps the list goes on Now it s really more of a sandwich place You can make your own cold cut sandwich or order a cold cut or panini Everything s 8 bucks so it s a good deal but I wasn t too impressed I ordered a jerk chicken panini but i thought it was just ehh kind of dry And the fries that came with it weren t that good All those pictures posted of the food here are from the previous ownership the deli itself isn t that bad it s just not really good anymore went from 5 stars to 3 stars hopefully they ll change it back a bit If so someone let me know cause i won t be back here again 
4xpypqlFIpcHxrcLz1h_0w CMU Random It took me a minute to find this place it s actually right across the street from the PNC bank You would never guess that this was a bar it made it even more difficult b c it was dark and raining I was able to find street parking right out front and when I got in the crowd was fairly young but that s what I expected around the universities It wasn t very crowded as I went during the week The bartender was friendly and drinks were extremely affordable I m not sure that I would go out of my way for PHI but if I was in the area and looking for a cheap drink then why not now that I know where it is 
4yAhKNo4b6vHAgNxyH745g CMU I ve gone here for lunch two times and each time I ve gotten a sandwich and fries mixed russet and sweet potatoes Both times I was happy with what I ordered It s all quality stuff but speaking as a poor grad student the value for your money isn t as good as it would be at some of the other restaurants in the area 
5-q6_4h8KivR0W1mde7ZQA CMU Within the past year Quaker Steak and Lube opened up a new location in Oakland Back in college I would have to drive 20 mins out towards the airport to get my Quaker Steak fix Back in the day Quaker Steak claims to be the Best Wings USA and I do like them a whole lot I haven t had the real Buffalo wings in Buffalo but I am making it a life goal to take a trip and try them for myself Until that time comes Quaker Steak will be my wings place They have other things on the menu too but I wouldn t know anything about them The Oakland location is convenient but it s not my favorite place What I do like about it is that you can look right into the kitchen from the take out window As I waited for my order I watched them fry my wings pour on the sauce shake it around in a big plastic bucket and create a masterpiece in my styrofoam take out container yum 
53P4gF1Y8nDdpIXzghnsMw CMU Probably the best place for all American food I stuck with fish which was really good Never can go wrong with this place Next to CMU and just a couple of blocks from Pitt Grilled salmon was done perfect and also had the rib eye steak with was good as well Good mashed potatoes and green beans too Take your friends out and never get disappointed Plenty of specials during the week to take advantage of 
589CTHQMC3gB-aevgFb3Rg CMU Flies in this place 
5EiDrFqfEq8Mv8fIJXJP7g CMU I haven t been home to Pittsburgh for a while and I was really excited to get out and explore the food scene Although Harris Grill wouldn t have been my first pick I try to stay away from the preppy Shadyside scene I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere food and service I really enjoyed indoor atmosphere that mixed trendy decor with dim sexy lighting Our server was excellent and kept the drinks coming and I was extremely impressed by their craft beer selection And I would certainly come back to enjoy their expansive outdoor patio I got to sample a lot of different selections We started with the Dippo de Queso con Carne which was a spicy mix of chilies cheese and chorizo Served with pita bread it was good but there are better things on the menu And onto those the Baby Burgers were delectable as were the Britney Spears I swear that s the real name The Britney Spears were marinated and skewered chicken that was served with some zesty chipolte sauce and rich pesto After all of this I probably would have given 3 stars HOWEVER the Mac Cheese was excellent and as a connoisseur of mac n cheese I know my stuff What topped off this meal was the incredible Eggplant Lasagna Lasagne Aubergine that I shared with a friend Now I m not one to ever order anything that doesn t have meat in it But I would truly go back to Harris Grill JUST FOR THE EGGPLANT LASAGNA The eggplant was breaded and fried and layered with pesto marinara and layers of delicious cheese I would highly recommend this dish to anyone whether you re a vegetarian or not And I will certainly be going back just to check out their bacon night 
5enCTbNLyZLUWs-Elq5iUw CMU It s true Their burgers are damn good And I fell bait to the Artisinal Cheeseburger the first time best decision ever Second time I had the Local which was still good but not as good as the Artisinal Their burgers are definitely big hearty ones with just the right amount of dressings It s really all in the meat that makes it so good at Union Grill cooked to perfection juicy and super satisfying The atmosphere is kinda dimlit but really cozy feeling It s got a charm of an English pub sort of I suppose it s one of the classier places on Craig Street a place where college students would get their takeout fix at neighboring restaurants like Maximum Flavor Little Asia Orient Express and Lulu s Noodles As a CMU student myself whose lab was on Craig Street I can certainly attest that going to Union Grill for a beer and a meal was a treat I never made it out to their wine night specials but it seems worth checking out 
5h0DwrrcWPARJ_bMfo5UOQ CMU I personally rarely come here specifically to eat I do love to come here for the atmosphere drinks girls Their waitresses are for the most part really hot The Food personally I like the combo of onion soup and the shady burger yea its not the best burger in town but its got a great taste to it Rest of their food is so so and some of it is down right awful but again i don t come here for the food The Atmosphere LOVE the atmosphere There is outdoor seating there are lots of windows there is a jukebox upstairs there is a fun bar area downstairs with lots of TV s so you can watch the game with buddies over some drinks There are always very attractive people here Waitresses really hot really nice great service This is def my favorite bar in shadyside but again I don t come here for the food except maybe the soup 
5HQNorckxxfRlrz-T3KKpw CMU This place was not nearly as gross as I anticipated In the middle of Oakland rusty sign I mean the place screams undergrad No thank you I was persuaded to go here one Friday after the semester was over for happy hour and had a good time I mean yes you can buy pitchers of shots here but you can also get Sam Adams in the 16oz super nice Sam Adams glass for 7 and keep the glass It s pretty big inside wasn t crowded or smokey and the food was not that bad for bar food I had a chicken bacon avocado wrap and it was tasty Friends had burgers and they cleaned their plates Hemingway s you went from hideous undergrad hangout in my mind to an establishment I would patronize 
5ivIa4a6rcyqeeSl2RnP6Q CMU Half price wine bottles Wednesdays Get the shady sticks Eat em when they re still hot Yum 
5RXCZ5VW29GRgWdVMPWGQQ CMU Meh The Harris Grill is one more American business in a long line to have great ideas ruined by terrible execution An entire page of delicious looking burgers Bland and overcooked Cool looking spaces Can get cramped and awkward with groups and sometimes it s hard to get a server or bartender to notice you I ve never once thought a group outing here was anywhere approaching comfortable And what about the famed BACON NIGHT It s not even good bacon They ll have to knock their game up several notches to achieve the potential contained in their great ideas 
5uDOVaXomnpJEucF7XBV2g CMU Awesome service burger n French dip were Amazing 10 dollar wine bottles just go here cant wait to come back 
5W0GmSEPLGLifP-OGR3amw CMU Excellent establishment The prices are fairly low for the quantity and quality of what you get I am also in love with their Happy Hour Half price drinks Every day of the week I ve been here a few times usually to unwind with some friends after a long week of classes or for a homework break during Happy Hour They also have the cheapest fish sandwich out of all the places I ve been I ve never been disappointed with anything I ordered here be it the fish sandwich their signature dish I forget the name but it had slices of turkey you won t miss it on the menu and their Pittsburgh salad The ambiance is excellent Very comfortable and home y Also when the sidewalk seating is available it is just top notch They also don t turn you down if you go at 11 50pm and want a few drinks In fact they check up in 10 minutes to see if you want more Really nice staff The only downside is the tap selection but seriously Happy Hour makes everything better 
60oJAMoS5JU6eJseLyYdMQ CMU I started off my visit to Quaker Steak with the Atomic Wing Challenge which is just eating six of their atomic wings Six wings obviously isn t much but the atomic wings are quite spicy and they require that you sign a liability waiver before eating them this is more for show than anything Yes they re pretty damn hot but they re bearable as long as you have a good tolerance for spicy food If you re comfortable eating foods with habaneros in them then you ll have no problem with the atomic wings Here s a pro tip though if you re getting the atomic wings ask them for a pair of food handling gloves This way you can avoid getting wing sauce all over your hands allowing you to actually touch your eyes or use the restroom later that day without torturing yourself Anyway after I finished that off I went back and got some more wings Louisiana Lickers Arizona Ranch and Golden Garlic I was impressed with the flavors as everything was quite good The wings were nice and meaty too which is good because a lot of wing places manage to hunt down wings with almost no meat on them which kind of defeats the purpose of eating them in the first place My one complaint is that I think the wings are a bit overpriced A half dozen wings is 5 and 83 cents per wing seems rather high to me Still though these wings are much better than most so it s probably worth it 
61UA5RozTe4pwNYZGlZuhQ CMU 8 50 with tax for a one topping pizza and 4 for a pitcher before 6pm and 6 after The 4 pitcher can even be Yuengling or Blue Moon Makes for a cheap dinner with friends The pizza is greasy but surprisingly tasty It s a bit smokey I can t wait until PA is no smoking in bars like Maine and California Dollar drinks Friday night attract quite a few students 
6C5FXOk9bV1POPwdOPSviQ CMU Hands down the best place for cheap drinks and delicious cheap food 7 shot pitchers 5 pitchers of beer and a half off food menu 9pm 12am can t be beat Depending on the bartender the shot pitchers can range from I m pretty sure this doesn t have alcohol in it to Holy blackout Love the Dum Dums that come floating on top one time they must have been out and we had gummi worms floating in our pitcher Try the Black Out and the Miley Cyrus Can t go wrong with the food The spinach and artichoke dip has a kick but the pita chips are the absolute best Grilled cheeses are some of the best Cloggin Fries OMG Seriously if you re looking for a cheap place to drink and satisfy your late night or resulting drunk munchies Hemingway s is the best Just don t mind the loud college crowd and beware the karaoke on Wednesday 
6EEytFSAmdCfb7OQJ8XWxw CMU Yes the portions are gigantic the calzone one of my party ordered was about the size of a Ford Pinto This is a wonderful gritty place that is oozing with character The food is more than decent and our waitress was a sweetheart The prices are very reasonable Be sure to check out the condom dispenser in the men s room for a very funny inscription a patron has written on it 
6jVKyZZcHO4JiqU3OJ0jOw CMU This place is awesome Even on a packed night at 11 30 we were still able to get a table in less than five minutes The atmosphere is great with friendly staff and patrons We ordered a buffalo chicken pizza which was just about perfect with its thin crust and brick oven charred bits We also ordered the dip sticks with mozzarella and the zen wraps as appetizers they would probably be considered entree sized at most other restaurants The dip sticks were a bit zippier than expected but still pretty good with the marinara sauce The zen wraps were quite unique and incredibly delicious We ended up having to take a lot of our food home because there was so much of it even though it was only two apps and a personal pizza I would suggest starting with one dish and going from there This is the place to go for late night munchies and decent prices We ll definitely be going again before our trip is over 
6JWDo63aPMiTuv9fC_AHIQ CMU harris grill i think your menu is trying too hard first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh menu was a little overly silly waitress was a little underly friendly helpful timely and food while decent was overpriced for the quality i may be back to pittsburgh but won t be back to harris grill 
6klWhto-kas_iit6ZSxAMA CMU Nice Atmosphere Good food Great time Plus half off drinks everyday from 6pm 8pm Dishes that I recommend Fried Fish Taco Turkey Devonshire 
6MMNzWwVVh-tiiKc7_rmug CMU I went here last night with my man friend around 9 00ish to get some grub We were starving so we were a bit disappointed that it was a 30 45 minute wait but it was a friday night We perused the drink list it is a bit confusing because it looks like a facebook page but settled on a MOFOjito and a margarita The MOFOjito mojito with pomegranate and the marg were served in pint glasses which was a surprise but so was the 20 tab for both of them My man friend was appalled he is normally an IC Light kinda guy After we waited by the very dimly lit bar for about 45 minutes the hostess sat us at a table in the downstairs portion of the restaurant basically right next to where we were standing I started off with the veggie chili which was hearty and filling It was topped with sour cream and served with a pita chip delish I also ordered a spinach salad which the server explained to me is now different from what s on the menu Something about no strawberries crumbled blue cheese spiced pecans It was definitely a change for the WORSE The salad came out looking rather lonely with sliced almonds 4 orange slices and chunks of mozzarella cheese It was sooooo bland The dressing was just straight up balsamic vinegar Not only was it bland but it was tiny almost looked like a side salad for 9 50 My date got the Salad a la pittsburgh he wasn t thrilled by it either His was much bigger than my salad and came with chicken i think it was 1 00 more We didn t get alcoholic drinks with dinner and our bill was 29 00 which isn t that much more than our bar tab for 2 drinks Pros Lively fireplace when you walk in the door a bunch of vegetarian options big drink list Cons Pricey drinks very dark inside sub par salads funny menu you have to read the whole description to figure out each item I understand how lazy that sounds but witty names are only good once in a while Overall Might go go back and not get a salad The beer selection looked promising 
6mS6qH8OhKenIUzxDNECLQ CMU I am a recent convert I had and loved both the Very Veggie and Tijuana Tuna My only issue with the place is that a regular sized tuna sandwich should not be 8 50 I mean if it were a huge hoagie okay but it s not I love the selection of veggie options but the jury is still out on whether I went back to PDC because of the novelty or because the food is delic Not sure if I can visit regularly at that price Curly fries are good too but they should really come with the sandwich and not be an addlt 2 
6pidwy2ofUcrs6Hvo_ybSA CMU Ha I ll get on the 3 starts bandwagon even though I enjoy my times here If s a fun crowd and beyond that much much more Beer and food are fine noting special 
6Q5nXyoskGOOz8VhLI8TNQ CMU Pretty mediocre saw the place on triple D and wanted to try it Wedding soup was good chicken parm was huge but not particularly outstanding Tomato sauce had a strange taste to it Place is a real dump but has character 
6RzKw1jt8NpL2hSXxha9bQ CMU I found myself at this fine establishment last night with my roommate Since I was in a abnormally random mood I blame the nap prior I decided to partake in a nice cold beer salmon with hummus and brownie smothered in mint chocolate chip ice cream all at once The very experience itself was fun and I have to say the staff was very supportive of my meal decision which was refreshing The service was not the best but also not terribly slow Price was right in the middle between cheap and expensive The lighting was dim and reminded me of an old time hotel The food itself was pretty good but not something to write home about assuming you still write letters which is pretty unique and I applaud you 
6v5p4DOxWIFLpAy81gqUEA CMU I m a fan of this place who can t be with three separate bars to go to Even if it is packed most weekends With the three separate bars it s like three separate atmospheres Downstairs is the kind of cool kind of hip bright bar where if you want to get up close and personal with someone you can The jukebox has an ample selection of tunes to choose from to tickle just about anyone s fancy On the colder days you can stand by the fireplace to warm yourself On the warmer days you can still stand by the fireplace but don t worry it s not on to roast the patrons It serves as a place to lean against and carry on a conversation with someone and be able to set your drink down if you like Several high tables dot the area if you feel the need to sit as well as stools around the bar Big windows allow you to view the people walking on the street as well as it lets them view you Upstairs is kind of the dim lit low key lounge bar Electronic dartboards for play some Saturdays the dance floor can be in use if a DJ is on premise Nice big somewhat circular bar in the middle with stools they are in the middle of a remodel by the looks of it to make it look even roomier Booths and high tables are available for sitting as well A coat rack is there for you convenience to place you coat but be careful especially if you re wearing a coat that looks similar to others The music played upstairs when a DJ is not around is that of the videos mentioned in this place s name It s like a DJ is there with the videos playing Dance and remix is all you hear huge plus The deck recently added onto is a nice place to be able to go and take in the air Tables are at an appropriate level outside enough to seat people but also the right about for people to mingle The newer portion of the deck reminds you of sitting in a small garden with lighted seating The deck is also used in cooler weather as well with their drop down curtains to keep the elements out and they heaters to keep the temperature comfortable Stools also line this bar as well Cash or credit and you can always start a tab I believe Tuesdays they now have a Bingo event available as well as a dart league Bartenders are always friendly and if you frequent enough remember your libation of choice One of the best bars to go to in Shadyside whether you are gay or straight 
7fqgRKkbv--DQkkHkavhAg CMU The Union Grill has a very nice atmosphere and good hearty American food Situated on one of the quieter streets of Oakland the interior is all wood paneled and gives off a very warm and comfortable vibe I ve been here twice for dinner and once for lunch and I have to say that I was very impressed with the dinner The first time I had their roast beef which was excellent The gravy was especially tasty The second time I had a strip steak with a baked potato and a Caesar salad the steak was big a juicy and cooked to a very good medium rare The salad a potato were also delicious For dinner I really like the Union Grill because of it s atmosphere It feels like a real restaurant pub not some hipster lair like so many other Oakland restaurants There were no drunk college kids mostly professionals it seemed Both times I had had a very relaxing dinner I forget on which nights but they do offer 10 bottles of wine you can t beat that One small drawback this place seems pretty popular so when I went there for lunch I ended up being there a little longer than planned This isn t the kind of place where you can order a burger eat it and be gone in 20 minutes The food was still excellent we had the jumbo wings really good buffalo sauce Caesar salads and a few bowls of a delicious wedding soup In short the Union Grill is a good bet for lunch and dinner in Oakland Don t come if you re on a schedule though Sit back relax and enjoy your meal 
7m9EXBHINGqww3ckWky-fA CMU Union Grill turned out to be by far one of the worst meals I ve had in Pittsburgh so far Strangely this place is frequented by many people which I assume is attributed to its location along Craig St next to CMU A large number of middle aged diners also frequent the place From what I ve heard from a friend who had been in Pittsburgh longer than I have Union Grill has seen better days Their food used to be cheaper and more delicious I assume that the middle aged clientele results from brand loyalty and the college students obviously from its location and lack of other gourmet burger joints within walking distance from CMU My group ended up here via the suggestion of another college student who was hosting 3 mutual friends from CA visiting for the weekend This place prides itself for being one of the best values in the city of Pittsburgh Statements I paraphrase are littered all over the menu stating that One can t get the quality of meat we use anywhere else for as low a price as we charge for the burgers and noone has ever been able to finish our fish sandwich because it s so large And to top that another printed sign as our centerpiece states in a number of different font size and styles byob no corkage fee Although they do keep the place quite clean i felt that the place had been worn past its time Environment typically doesn t affect my opinion of a place too much however The food itself was enough to render this place no more than 1 star to me Our server was friendly although she seemed to have more trouble being able to hear everyone s voices in my party when we came to ordering our food Our food did not take long to come out considering how full the restaurant was I had ordered a fish sandwich with waffle fries while the rest of my party ordered burgers some with waffle fries others with shoestring fries A couple of points 1 One should NEVER cut shoestring fries as thinly as they do At that thickness there s no way one can end up with successful fries after going through the fryer each of these 1 5 2 inch fries were translucent from oil absorption and all seemed to have a portion of skin prompting me to wonder whether they just sliced up potato peelings to make these fries I ve never seen something like this and I hope I don t see it again 2 You definitely get your fair share of meat based on observation and testimony by my friends I can t make fair judgement of the taste of the burger as a whole but based on the smell and little taste of the meat it lacked any type of seasoning My fish sandwich was the blandest thing that I had ever tasted When I ordered they asked me Do you want any sauce with that Little did I know how crucial that sauce was needed to bring ANY flavor to my sandwich It was as if the cook literally defrosted the fish threw it in flavorless batter and threw it in the fryer The fish certainly took up a large area on my plate but lacked any thickness causing the whole fried filet to have the consistency of a chip than any type of fish The enriched flour bun that the fish sat on tasted like weeks old bread that had been heated quickly on the grill Once again it lacked all flavor 1 4 way through my sandwich I was starting to feel sick from the blandness I threw on some ketchup to save the sandwich 1 3 way through I had to take one side of the bun off and eat the fish sandwich open faced 1 2 way through the amount of batter on the fish and the size of the overwhelmingly huge stale and dry bun was too much and I decided to eat the rest of the sandwich with half the half bun i had left and took off half the batter on the fish Having finally barely downed the sandwich I was starting to dry heave but kept my composure as I was dining with guests in town 3 Even the waffle fries were not completely crispy on the outside and almost tasted as if they were left out for a bit before being served Because they were better than the shoestring fries I exchanged these with my friend who had regrettably ordered the shoestring fries This place caters to those who value quantity over quality and those who order food to accompany alcohol I ll be sticking to my other burger joints and fish sandwich joints in Pittsburgh 
7OF4WzQ5OXUWsnFoVlrHug CMU Hemingway s does have half price food specials every day Don t remember the exact hours but it s the late night and afternoon hours They also have 1 75 draft specials each day The food here is decent but you go here to get drunk This place is always packed with college kids They are also really really strict with id s so if you have a fake it may be hard to get in At least it was a couple years ago when I was in college There is a pool table darts gaming room at the back which usually isn t too crowded As for the food you have to try the Cardiac Stix Deep fried provolone sticks tossed with buffalo sauce topped with cheddar jack cheese and bacon Served with a side of bleu cheese dressing Talk about a heart attack waiting to happen We used to go here really late to just drink and maybe get some appetizers so I can t really say how good the food is besides the cardiac stix and the cloggin fries 
7V8PAWw9qkMLiyeHwmFcRA CMU Why hasn t anyone mentioned bacon night Do they still have it We found this place a couple year ago when we lived down the street in shadsterside Everything that I could want and more best place in the burgh Since moving to DC I am still on their email list and tear up a little when I realize what specials and events I am missing at Harris 
7WJ20wQ6Aj4mwAHxlZbxsg CMU One of the best spots in the city Gorgeous crowd hilarious menu awesome patio The absolute best people watching and drinks spot in the city Glad to have you back Harris Grill 
7Y7wX_GC3DDKMYSEtl3djQ CMU Harris has a nice patio and a decent bar but good luck getting served If it is crowded or the bar is just full I ve always had to wait to get served The beer selection is decent but not all that big For a much larger beer selection check out Buffalo Blues a few blocks down the road The best part is the patio if you want decent food and good outdoor seating Harris is a good choice if you don t mind waiting 
7yHiEUdrtIuTLP--ozGA9A CMU I ve been here a couple times and like it it s comfortable in a yinzer way The walls have dark paneling the food is unpretentious the portions are huge the bill is low and the service is pleasant but not overly chatty fake My favorites on the menu are chicken parm and pizza The chicken parm is huge 2 3 meals on a plate basically The chicken isn t pounded too thin which is key because they do put a decent amount of crust on the chicken which I happen to like because mmm FRIED BATTER and the pasta isn t overcooked Pizza isn t thin crust but it s not pan thick either I love it for that reason It holds up to the tons of cheese that actually melts into goo without being a gummy mess The pasta and pizza sauces are good on the sweeter side but not overly so Husband likes the turkey club it has a ton of thick sliced turkey breast I m mainly taking a star off because I don t like their fries which are homemade shoe string I am kind of picky when it comes to fries so maybe I am being too critical I just found them to be kind of mushy and weak Maybe I just got a bad batch I dunno after having them once I never ordered them again The neighborhood is just fine Unless working class neighborhoods and urban infrastructure scares you I think it reads as sketchy to some people because it s tiny nothing is fancy and the businesses aren t all clustered together The Run looks like a small working class town 
7ynU5TW5qGkezg58yrzyyw CMU I love Boston Market too I seldom sit down at this location but usually get take out Their chicken is always downright tasty and moist I d suggest asking for some side bbq sauce it brings the meal to a whole other dimension and I have a hard time deciding on sides You can t go wrong with mac n cheese vegetables corn stuffing and sweet potato yams The cream spinach however seems to be different each time we order it The cornbread while still good seems to have been reduced in thickness I ve also had the chicken pot pie and so scrumptious Boston Market always hits the spot and service has always been peppy with no complaints 
7Yu6ObXmvebt2JuuxH6bZA CMU Amazing beer selection wings pierogies sandwiches salads and the best patio in Pittsburgh I am especially grateful that it is open again after the fire last summer If you can t sit outside then go to the 2nd floor where you can people watch over Ellsworth Staff is awesome helpful and they really know what they are doing when it comes to beer One of the only places I would go to in Shadyside a great vibe awesome home made style food and great beers to choose from 
80lqzvYYgkKIVqhE6jHZ1A CMU I would be reluctant to eat here again My turkey burger was undercooked never a good idea with turkey I ordered avocado on it but instead it came as little slices in a little cup on the side And the slices weren t of avocado but of a decorative avocado made of wax That s how it tasted anyway The fries were good and the beer selection is respectable I d go back for a brew but never a turkey burger 
81k_1FvDdYdCKiNRCGgMNA CMU A friend of mine saw this on Diners Drive In s Dives so we knew we had to try it It s a hole in the wall restaurant but it s a family favorite Don t come here if you re in a hurry but the food is worth the wait Huge portions fairly cheap 
8acG1VOG8iWMU24MlDZpjQ CMU Step 1 Check the weather Make sure it s a nice summery evening Step 2 Arrive at PCaf with a large group of friends Step 3 Sit out on the deck Step 4 Order drinks and a heckload of wings Step 5 GO TO TOWWWWWN 
8crOyzxpdxqHuNRx8QgcCA CMU Well said Jessica W I also want to put a special note in about the waffle fries more specifically the awesome sauce that comes with them that is completely addicting I have had generally good experiences with fuel and fuddle however my dessert spoon tasted of green onions the last time I was there Strange combo with peanut butter pie But definitely good bar food 
8ffrjvX9f7WTYWncYqflrQ CMU Just had to update this to say that Big Jim s is now smoke free 
8HRqwuB6relqlJBjrMSeXA CMU I have only been to Shady Grove twice when I am in the area and don t feel like breaking the bank Both times I have ordered one of their sandwiches the first time being a caprese wrap and the last time a chicken florentine sandwich The Chicken Florentine was definitely the better of the two though honestly I have not had a caprese as a sandwich that I like anywhere My favorite thing about this place is the 2 Mexican beers and 4 tequila shots The tequila shots are for any tequila of your choice Last time we were there my boyfriend and I threw back a couple of Patron Silvers We only stopped because we had to go shopping for house stuff being an adult sucks sometimes I usually go with Dos Equis either the Lager or Amber as my drink of choice Can t beat tasty 2 beers 
8kkFTrxoS_wZT7Pz314BPQ CMU As someone already said this is a very good college bar restaurant and I suspect all the rules are for the college kids I try to get there for dinner before there s a long wait by 6pm and it s usually crowded Very friendly staff Good drinks Good prices for a bottle of wine Best burgers Don t know about that but I rarely get a bad meal This is inexpensive homestyle food meat loaf etc I also like the bustling atmosphere 
8N2x1WayMf4H8NsWC0G6wQ CMU In town for a wedding Rollafatty was ok didn t actually see taste any pepperoni Naked truth pizza and a house salad with roquefort for main course was great Apple thing for dessert was huge Like a pizza with 3 scoops of ice cream Solid beer selection Sandwiches all looked really good People next to us had buffalo chicken dip smelled horrible but looked interesting 
8OoQqBCcnTgwobOwXJ9X4A CMU Gotta love Fuel and Fuddle Awesome beer selection and consistently good food that doesn t disappoint The atmosphere is fun and laid back and this place really could be franchised 
8tTaUlXrKmcpU3prNvz8fw CMU Hem s has 5 pitchers and great french fries a good place for munchies and beer after work or class or between classes or heck when you should be in class Go there Wednesday night for karaoke even if you just go twice you ll already know the regulars the white college boys who try to rap the girl who gets up and blows your mind the oldest guy at the bar who sounds like a professional the drunk foreign students who give American classics a great accent 
91KBvZPgFIHHLkTOgKt8aw CMU It s a good thing Harris Grill has good beer and Bacon Night since otherwise you wouldn t have anything to occupy you for the 45 minutes to an hour it takes to get food on your table from the point in time that you order FYI definitely order that last round of drinks plus an additional one as you ask for your bill since the poor service doesn t stop when the food actually gets to your table I wrote HG off the first time I went there then gave them a second chance after a friend asked me Guess what my final assessment is 
99KI4GymrQsu-w9d5f1PYg CMU Fuel is one of my top choices for weekend brunch in Pittsburgh Their free unlimited typically good coffee and twists on the classics make a great choice for one or ten If you come in with ten you may want to call ahead to get the less noisy basement tables no matter what time of day Brunch is the best in my opinion as Fuel transforms from a noisy dark college restaurant to a calmer lighter atmosphere Also they have specials on bloody marys Half price starts at 11 pm and includes about 65 of the menu Like all half price in Oakland establishments you will see a line unless it s a school break or you re there 30 minutes early It s worth the wait though for delicious food I m a fan of their salads but their pizzas are pretty excellent also Desserts like the apple burnover think huge brick oven baked apple turnover with vanilla ice cream are quite enough for two Beer selection is fantastic and conveniently laid out for you in the menu prices and all If you go there for the drinking be sure to get some crab dip You will not regret it Unless you have an allergy 
9CzfubdCVoUGjyl8dC3Vfw CMU My wife and I are Triple D junkies so we try to find places wherever we travel that Guy has been to Last night we tried Big Jim s She had the Chicken Parm sandwich and I had the Gnocchi Both were fabulous Obviously the sandwich was way to big for one sitting snowed took the rest for a late night snack 
9DRZRuB2AwcX_UqMn5l8gw CMU Fancy looking but Bartender is a douchebag Drinks usually suck 
9EvRpeTBSB19H1MtIckKSQ CMU Most of my visits to Fuel and Fuddle were for their late night menu which in my recollection begins at 11pm There s always a line out the door before then so be ready to wait I loved their big wood fired oven The pizzas are really tasty smoking hen the naked truth and the smashed potato pizzas are must try s Try their big ass brownie sundae but be sure to share it with a friend because you won t be able to finish it alone 
9fpjWYhe2x-xuWg28v909Q CMU Good place for lunch I am at this place once or twice a month Get there before 12 and there is no wait for a table Voodoo chicken crabcakes and salmon plate are pretty good Portions and drinks are on the large side Desserts have good This is the only restaurant I have been to that has a very reasonably priced wine selection Decent wines wine spectator rating on the menu for less than 15 One extra star for this feature alone 
9LyLoqFNQKlxZlmZXE-dBA CMU Stopped in to Fuel Fuddle to grab a quick late night bite with one of my buddies and wow was I impressed I was in a wing mode so I decided to tackle a dozen Cajun wings based on my waitress s recommendation It turned out to be an excellent call because these wings were good enough to crack my top 10 list Easily As far as the cajun sauce it was a good mixture of spicy vinegary and zesty with some possible hints of old bay seasoned salt It s truly difficult to create a wing sauce that encompasses so many different flavors but Fuel Fuddle pulled it off If you re a wing aficionado in the Burgh you need to check this place out Great wings and great service what more could a guy ask for 
a32USOxL1fyRoC7CtYdDvQ CMU Very cool american bar off the main campus of Carnegie Mellon I ordered the special of the day the crab cake sandwich and I really enjoyed it It came with huge steak fries that definitely met all my carb needs It also came with a good little corn salsa that I topped on my sandwich Nice staff and the food came out in good time Happy all around 
Abgvmz8VgcYSy6nJmxlHAA CMU Fuel and Fuddle has been my favorite place since I set foot on Pitt s campus four years ago This place is fantastic Yeah so it s a little loud in the evening but so worth it If you re looking for a more relaxed dining experience go before all of the students come in to take advantage of the late night 1 2 price menu However this place is often crowded because it s just so darn good Great beer selection and even better American bar food My appetizer of choice is the Dive Diner Fries For dinner I love the sandwiches which come with a yummy mixture of fries and sweet potato fries The pizzas are great also And dessert split the Big Azz Brownie with somebody Overall a great place you just have to be willing to put up with the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant at the heart of a college campus 
AdIkQkqWGfyOr9A8UbPXDA CMU My best friend and I were visiting my mom in Carnegie and we needed to get out and find something a little more exciting before we left A bear friend of my mom s recommended 5801 and we had a great time even though we were just talking The three separate bars are great we were able to get away from the hideously smoke filled lounger which is really pretty and had awesome bartenders but ugh cigarettes the upstairs bar was also very nice much less smokey so that s where we stayed patio was CROWDED all the bartenders are amazing and have very deft hands I LOVE the cocktails especially for their names like Platinum Blonde and Smurf Cum absolutely delicious and you can t taste the booze at all the upstairs bar was not too loud so best friend and I could actually carry a conversation without shouting which seems a bit backwards considering the lounge bar is smaller and more intimate but the music while great is BLARING each bar has a different atmosphere which is also pretty cool I m also glad that they welcome all genders so that my best friend could walk in with his token straight girl with no trouble 
adLp8OEjXpbrRD4mMakrfQ CMU Went here with friends and family on New Year s Eve The food was good as was the selection of beers Ribs pizza s pulled pork steak sandwich and alligator stew all yummy although the alligator stew was a little heavy on the black pepper I guess that s meant to represent the alligator biting back I plan to go back again although I m told it s usually very crowded We had no problem getting in on New Year s Eve and they did take a reservation But we arrived an hour early 7p and were still seated 
ado7YlDxya9k0MHs4IfLvA CMU I m reviewing this place as a bar that sometimes I eat at Rather than a restaurant that I happen to have some drinks at Using this lens this place is pretty good Specifically the pizza is very good Shady sticks as an appetizer also great think pokey sticks if you went to penn state and ever ordered from Gumby s I was there again this past Sunday and had a Greek salad It exceeded my expectations I ve been many times over the past year and I believe they ve made some improvements to their salad options I was pleased I haven t had the burgers or sandwiches lately so won t comment on their flavor but their menu is extensive so there are many many options Again compared to a BAR not another restaurant Wednesday night is wine night half off bottles of wine Which is a wonderful headache inducing special The place is usually packed after 7pm every night Little room to move no seats etc And yes there are a fare number of Ed Hardy and Affliction shirts I m only giving this a 3 star because the atmosphere and service drive me nuts sometimes Food and drinks alone would warrant a better review If you re not interested in the mayhem try them out for a weekend lunch A great stop if doing some Walnut Street shopping 
ae-0UJ6Tn5Zik0g4xP6Pcg CMU The food is not good Weekends are very crowded So mediocre b 
AgEixnZ7xk5uYzR0GY7OcQ CMU i came here for taco tuesday so I didn t have anything else besides their salsa fresca appetizer and their beef and chicken tacos much like PJ s pub a small bar nestled between dorm buildings at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore MD both places offered a pretty unauthentic selection of tacos for taco tuesdays i used to enjoy ordering 6 7 small tacos and a corona to wash them down i was seeking the same experience here in pittsburgh the tacos are definitely a step up from those in that baltimore pub but are also a tad more expensive i was happy to have found a place hearby for cheap tacos however so I ll probably be coming back for those however STAY AWAY from the salsa fresca appetizer priced at 5 or 6 bucks they throw an extremely bland version of their pico de gallo made with at most 2 jalapeno slices in a quantity no larger than half of a salsa container at chipotle along a bed of chips which actually weren t that bad reminded me a bit of la salsa s chips a mexican fast food restaurant chain in CA this almost ruined the whole taco tuesday deal day for me i ll probably go back for taco tuesdays simply due to location 
AI7rTZbfvTIWsmpwTqJbFA CMU Yes another chain but I gotta admit these are some of the best wings you will ever have hands down One of the few chains I will visit in any part of the US Cold beer funky decor and mill hunkies old and young commiserating the state of world affairs in PA If you dig wings ya gotta go here at least once 
aIXWCVfYNhEa_lbV39FzHQ CMU Welp I did it Six Triple Atomic Wings They make you sign a waiver purely for show it seems like and give you a bumper sticker and a window decal and provide a little glove to wear for the experience I was glad for the glove This particular location is nice or was nice for me that night because of the cafeteria style setup You order at one counter pick up at another I was glad to see this because I was going out for the spiciness and really wasn t too interested in table service tipping etc The triple atomic wings are spicy to be sure but I ve had worse Still I wouldn t recommend them unless you really love spicy foods They will punish you both in the mouth and on every stage of their journey through your body Over 12 hours later I m still getting random adrenaline rushes from my body absorbing more and more of the capsaicin from them As far as the place itself upsides are the food s not terribly expensive but it could be cheaper From what I ate Triple Atomic Wings and fries I think the food s all right Not fantastic but I d eat there again for sure The staff was a little too informal for standard American customer service but I liked that And the service was quick They were also handling a HUGE customer load right at closing time a basketball team from out of state and I did not hear a single complaint so I give them credit for that 
ALDBJEkXzOkm4By9fa80kQ CMU This is the best place to grab lunch or dinner in the entire UPMC mega complex in Oakland They ve got a decent selection of salads soups flatbread pizzas and sandwiches Plus there s always a daily special and tons of desserts Your food is made to order and actually pretty darn tasty All of their sandwiches come with homemade potato chips thick crunchy with a sprinkle of salt The French dip is a must try as is the wild mushroom pizza ask them to go light on the balsamic reduction Healthier options include a grilled chicken salad minus the sweet potato fries and fresh made yogurt smoothies The staff are friendly and they try to move the line quickly but sometimes it s backed up They re open M F 10 30 7 15pm They accept credit cards 
amNgYnq7AquVjB7tDMlXhA CMU Was visiting Pitt a while back and everyone said Big Jims was the place to eat They couldnt have been more right Big Jims is a place you wouldnt even notice as a restaurant on the outside and I cant even recall any businesses surrounding it The food is where this place really shines I settled on the Veal Parmesan and couldnt believe my eyes when it came to the table the veal was bigger than my platter I couldnt even finish my meal and ended up taking half of it home great value for the money They also make homemade wedding soup thats outta this world We woulda dined at Big Jim s our entire time in Pitt but Diners Drive Inn s and Dives happened to be filming while we were there and we couldnt get near the place again bummer 
AOE_vpkfRfKZQZ4R9ONnVQ CMU I like Union Grill despite all the flies hanging out inside Their burgers pretty good but they are HUGE I can never finish a whole burger especially with the fries I got their mashed potatoes once and it was really gross but other than that everything a okay 
arQVtbVx_Vn00jrQrU21XQ CMU Came here after 11pm with a friend entire menu is practically half off Come around 10 45 and get your name on the list when a table opens up they ll call you in get s to be pretty packed around 12 sweet potato fries awesome buffalo chicken pizza awesome r wings awesom est everything ends up to be about 4 50 each service is good too 95 54 chance you ll go into a food coma afterwards lively place filled with college crowd i would most def come here again 
aUeel2wXAEQ6M20JySPD-w CMU Completely surprised by this place The drinks were good strong cheap The food was excellent For 3 vodka drinks 2 beers chicken veggie quesadillas and mini burgers we paid 35 Cute dark little place with outside seating We sat at the bar Got great service 
aVGAf4b7fCsvkHlCY1Ybaw CMU i ve heard so much about primanti s brothers and the pittsburgh delis and how this one is better than primantis Maybe i ordered the wrong thing but i wasnt that impressed we ordered the reuben with corned beef and the muffalotta the olive spread in the muffalotta made it very salty and the bread was so toasty and hard that it was cutting up the roof of my mouth the reuben was ok i wish we got pastrami instead of the corned beef and i wish we had more sauerkraut on it too it was decent but i wasn t floored or maybe its because my expectations were high not sure but either way i wouldnt go back again 
aWNYql8TcCiJhnOA-r72EA CMU Wow I know a lot of people who drool over this place I am a semi regular I like the people and drinks but the food is just a disappointment Last night I had one of the worst burgers I ve ever eaten severely overcooked i ordered it medium and charred I had to coat the thing with mustard and franks to get it down my throat and yeah yeah I know I couldn t sent it back but I didn t I ve eaten at a beer dinner I ve eaten there numerous times for dinner and I ve never been blown away The best things in my opinion are the black and blue medallions wings and two dishes served at a beer dinner that arent on the menu I would say harris is great for a happy hour maybe some finger foods decent draft beer and frozen cosmos If you want to eat dinner just dont have terribly high expectations Sorry harris the food has gone down hill a lot 
AXHCuA-EobFEgvip5ZW6lQ CMU I drank here once for 7 straight hours with about 10 people I bought about 10 pitchers of beer and 5 pitchers of shots My bill at the end of the night was 54 Oh and we had a pizza from Pizza Pauls Only in Pittsburgh 
A_5otlNuM6QAc4qxvW6R5A CMU PHI gets three stars solely for the fact that it s across the street from my school and is a cheap lunch spot Decent melty cheesy subs for 4 and 5 pitchers the poor grad student s dream However they only play audio on their tvs during Steelers and Pitt games not for Monday Night Football or any other games and the place just reeks smoke which is something that I am still accepting here in the Burgh You make up your own mind 
b4iqJ0re9OUuGVIwEoxyow CMU This dining experience was lousy company excluded and a reminder to me that I should always trust my sushi instincts If Shady Grove is the best that Walnut Street has to offer as far as drinking and dining then it s no wonder that Shadyside needs a boost of steroids Perhaps Barry shouldn t have been so quick to leave the Burgh or he should have left some of his good stuff behind My friend and I decided to order some of their artisan pizzas and the Margharita and the Pesto were our choices The honey wheat dough tasted like it came directly from the nearest Taco Bell caramel apple empenada assembly line The mutilated tomato bits strewn across each of the pizzas also must have come from a Taco Bell assembly line Most of the items that should have been on the pizza were MIA When I asked our server about it her expression was as empty as the street outside which i thought would be jam packed with shoppers considering it was the Sidewalk Sale Event 
bA2GKwqxE1hAc_w_FA5ppA CMU This place is just great I d say stick to happy hour though Half price draft beers frozen cosmos and wings Really that s the only reason I originally went to Harris The frozen cosmos are awesome the draft beer selection is equally as awesome The food is surprisingly good at Harris The outdoor patio is great for happy hour if the weather is nice I haven t been there past the hours of 9 so I can t really speak on its status as a night spot 
BdsUooWn07BB-AB9q-Ls_Q CMU Great burger and beer What more could you want 
beYAu8dKl7Vr7iwKf6XS2Q CMU 2 words TATER TOTS tater tots give me such a nostalgic feeling thinking back to my elementary middle school days i get them everytime im at harris grill for the following reasons 1 a plate of them costs lets say 3 bucks n they pile like 20 to 30 tots so that makes it like 10 cents for a bite of salty heaven 2 the unexpected great companion for booze especially since harris grill does have a whole book filled with different cocktails you re gonna b there for a while and you re going to get hungry sooo u no where im going with this 3 tater tots are AWESOME 4 every good thing associated with tater tots do i need to say more but seriously i have tried other things there n they are just as fabulous the calamari is definitely a must try their bacon n cheese burger is glorious even the vegan falafel tasted like i was eating meat meaning that it was just as flavorful as everything else the ambiance is what you want it to b i ve come here with my girlfriends i ve also come here with a posse of dudes and not to mention on suit night with my best guy friend its always a good time i love dining here esp when its warm out so my friends n i can chill on the deck n drink to the moon and stars 
BFa_8twFk5awGBD3B8bINQ CMU Shadyside s best sandwich is found at PDC Piled with tons of meat you can t go wrong with just about anything there The rare roast beef with bacon bleu cheese and tomatoes was my personal favorite back in the day The nachos are also a pretty good option for when you re broke as they feed two people easily 
BFFxJu7ffUH2V-JK0Qd5hA CMU Cafe 509 I really want to love you I want you to be my neighborhood coffee hangout I want you to be the Cafe 61C of Greenfield I want to wake up on Sunday and look forward to coffee and web browsing in your great coffee house atmosphere On the plus side your waitstaff is super friendly Your eggs are perfect There s hot sauce on all of the tables and you re not afraid to use cilantro The coffee is bottomless But right now I just like you There s a possibility we might end up being just friends Your food is ok You are reasonably priced but I wish you had a veggie burger Update apparently there is a veggie burger but I saw no mention of it on the menu and a veggie sausage substitute for the breakfast dishes An espresso machine and better drip coffee would be good And how about some real maple syrup I wish you played hip music instead of easy rock The TV in the dining area makes me cringe I wish your atmosphere was more homey and inviting Can you take down that giant wall that separates the kitchen from the dining area Can you turn that big window into a garage door like Coffee Tree on Walnut Can you have outdoor seating Can you have rotating local artwork for sale Greenfield s population is changing We re getting younger and hipper and not just because I showed up 8 months ago ha ha You re in a great position to win this crowd with a fun hang out cafe especially if you managed to be hip and kid friendly at the same time lots of young families in the neighborhood Please help me love you I do so desperately want to be in love 
bjSZnRL0cRzc-tiOTf_Kyw CMU Some friends and I stopped here so we could sit outside have a couple drinks and relax This place met those needs We didn t try any of the food beyond the fruit cup that my friend had and enjoyed The drinks were well made the service was okay and the seating was fine I d go back to try the food but nothing to go out of the way for 
bMOFeGA8SUq8-h8JLNWsQw CMU Great place for some social drinking after hours You really cannot complain about a place that is packed with university students drinks and food It going to be an interesting night anyway you look at it So there are two parts to the this place the downstairs bar and seating area If this area just seems to packed to find somewhere to sit move along to the back and find the stairs that head up to the second bar area upstairs I spent most of my time upstairs where there was a jukebox blasting top 40 s and hip hop The bartender actually made me put more money into the jukebox when the music stopped saying she was not going to serve until there were beats Well after some bar food and beers the night was under way And the place stayed packed until closing Summary 2 Dos Equis on Thursdays you have got to be kidding me 
Bnt3xbsGn5ZAh6B01CDkjg CMU CMU s own dive bar this place is full to the brim on friday nights Lot of non cmu people seem to come here regularly as well Remember to get your real or fake state id or passport to be able to get in These guys also have awesome pizza and fries 
bslZUGbus0AhUDmTsyfNbg CMU A welcome departure from your typical Oakland eateries the Union Grill is a quaint sit down restaurant with an admirable selection of food and libation J is obsessed with their burgers they do medium rare just perfectly every time he says But I wouldn t know anything about that I ll stick to the Hummus Extravaganza which can be shared but I usually get it with as a meal or I ll opt for the 6 Grain Veggie Melt which is a roasted veg sammie on locally made 6 grain bread Service has always been reliable and the prices are unbeatable P S They no longer offer the shoe string potatoes I m sure a lot of people may be pleased to hear that 
bviGAY3LUNOcOFaI6f_HDA CMU I saw Big Jim s on Diners Drive ins and Dives Went there when in Pittsburgh with my son visiting Pitt had a great lunch My son went to Pitt and I have been back several times The food is very good large servings and reasonably priced This place will surprise you It is off the beaten path You have to be looking for it because it is below the highway in a neighborhood that leads nowhere to my knowledge It is unattractive at best but the service is good food is very good fresh plentiful and very reasonable If you like good food funky places and you are not a snob stop in and give it a try 
BX2E_5psDW_VSLzgTgfTsQ CMU Went out to eat here with a friend the other night First thing this place is extremely vegetarian friendly but not in an overtly I love growing my own vegetables and using vegetable oil to fuel my Prius sort of way Still plenty of options for carnivores I ended up ordering nachos with mango salsa to start and a southwestern salad for the the main course The mango salsa was great I just wish they served more seeing as the ratio of chips to salsa was kind of lop sided The southwestern salad was fantastic With a healthy dose of black beans avocado and this tangy vinaigrette type dressing which definitely hit the spot I became an instant fan I m usually not the type to order salads but my friend warned me in advance of the serving size and she wasn t lying They literally serve these salads in deep stainless steel bowls The appearance is kind of raw but my taste buds don t lie Overall our experience was good though I wish the service was a bit more prompt Having to wait an eternity for the check was kind of painful Otherwise I d easily give this place 4 stars Regardless I ll be back in the near future to check out some of the other offerings on the menu 
BX5PUCziwuv-qz_CG5dM2w CMU Their pepperoni rolls are great and their ribs are surprisingly good 
bxuMxx1q0WRdm7weB1KnfQ CMU Oh Johnny s how have I not reviewed you before I am sitting here eating some Johnnys for lunch ordered ahead and took it to go and I see stars 5 stars I was a little hesitant to put that last one on there just because this isn t a nice restaurant but that is also why you can feed 5 people for 40 and all have leftovers I can personally suggest the teriyaki cheesesteak tuna melt reuben grilled cheese fries taco salad and chicken salad which is just the long way of saying you can t go wrong with the food here Johnny is a gracious host and his wife cooks in the back Which also means if you come at the wrong time lunch rush you can be waiting a long while and you ll be warned of this when you sit down But you can always order ahead and show up for lunch and it ll come right out to you without any wait The ambiance is sports bar and the food is top notch and large plates This is definitely my go to place for American Food even though they do offer some Fried Rice and Teriyaki noodle dishes which are nice and spicy If you ve always walked by this place why not walk in 
BY5eLL-xhqSlK1Z_A9vMOA CMU Wanted to go somewhere I hadn t been before and realized that despite always passing it I have never been So I went and it looked promising from the outside Our waitress was attentive and people seemed to be enjoying themselves I ordered the Jerk Mahi Mahi on Kaiser and my fiancee ordered the Caprese Sandwich This is where things started to fall apart My sandwich came on a hamburger bun not a Kaiser roll and the fish was mediocre to decent nothing to write home about but the jerk rub was not nearly as spicy as a jerk rub should be On the menu the Caprese Sandwich is vegetarian and says Add chicken 3 The sandwich came with chicken which we did not order when we asked the waitress she said that it automatically comes with chicken and therefore also comes automatically for 11 instead of 8 if we didn t want chicken we had to ask to have the sandwich come as it says it does on the menu If it automatically comes with chicken then say that on the menu and charge 11 otherwise only give us chicken if we ask The fries which accompanied our sandwiches were also decent but not great so in the end the food was a little on the pricey side for the quality and more importantly not consistent with the menu from which we ordered All in all a disappointment 
BZzEBd0L50fbqsJgcAV8cw CMU If it weren t for the fact that my Partner In Cuisine and I can walk to the Union Grill whenever we want we d probably never go there The food and service are pretty decent but they aren t really anything you can t find anywhere else Between the two of us we have pretty much tried everything on the menu and nothing really sticks out as being superlative except maybe the waffle fries The old stand bys are the fish sandwich the French dip and the salmon salad During the warm weather the Union Grill offers a lovely opportunity for al fresco dining on Craig Street Unfortunately because of the lax smoking rules in Pittsburgh there s always someone standing 5 feet from you smoking a cigarette Because of that we sadly always have to eat inside I do like if you order a soda that you get it in a gigantic glass this avoids the need for your server to keep running back and forth refiling pop Their alcoholic drinks are somewhat more expensive than the other bars in Oakland so between that and the fact the place closes so damn early I think 10 during the Summer the PIC and I rarely go there unless we are too hungry or lazy to think of anywhere else go 
CbEz1Nf_yRFKMOWDZju5wA CMU Oh Panther Hollow Inn you used to be a dame a real broad Dank ill lit smoky rude maybe a few health code violations thrown in for good measure In short a dive But now You re not a dive And anyone who says otherwise esp those precious li l CMU children who frequent you has no frakin clue as to the nature of a real dive You can pretend to be a dive cheap prices smoking allowed short staffed and that s all good and well A good time can still be had no doubt But admit it we both know you ve had some work done in your golden years You have better lighting and floors that aren t always sticky the staff aren t always gruff and the clientele are just kittens now shakes head sadly and orders another clean not dirt cheap drink 
cdFg7k3Q8VFOkMIMZLjeew CMU Good casual bar atmosphere The layout is a little goofy I think the building was formerly a ski and sport store but that does allow you find some privacy if you want Good sandwiches try the Cuban very nice wings and ribs The bar area gets busy for Steelers Pens Pitt and WVU games Prices are typical for both food and drinks Service is good great if they re not packing them in Nice big parking lot Surrounded by Scott Township and Mt Lebanon close to Green Tree and Banksville Rd 
CeUV154CsbdOUOFfEUxd_A CMU This is a great restaurant for what it is bar food but bar food done right The brick oven pizzas are exceptional and the menu contains a few unique topping options see the smashed potato pizza The sandwiches and burgers all come on delicious twist rolls made by a local bakery The wings a crispy and drowned in a number of spicy sauces The half price menu after 11pm is worth showing up early and waiting for but occasionally you get what you pay for wings lacking on sauce etc The beer list is what really shines here With over 100 bottles and around 10 rotating draft selections there s always something new to try You can even join their beer cult try all 100 brews in their beer bible and get your name up on the wall The cult s motto shut up and drink 
cGt8hk4--l1a4D1MkRvoJQ CMU Fuel is filled with a variety of people The lunch crowd consists of an eclectic mix of professionals students and locals Anytime after lunch and you re in for mostly the undergraduate grad student crowd The menu is quite varied Appetizers salads pizzas and sandwiches line the pages with funny names like Rosemary s breasts a delicious chicken sandwich recommended with the cajun mayo lettuce and tomato you need to ask and Rolla fatty a pepperoni roll with mozzarella baked in delicious I also recommend the house salad with apples and walnuts Stay away from the chili and most of the large plates I don t think they sell enough of them to remember to prepare them properly Good food mostly HORRIBLE for conversation This place is built entirely from painted cinder block no noise absorption whatsoever Fuel always proves good for a young crowd during a sporting event but I would NEVER bring a date here ever Great for college kids they offer a 1 2 price menu on most items after 11 It was great when I was in school Things get really tight in there though They have a great beer menu one of the best in Pittsburgh I would give it 3 5 stars if I could You average without alcohol about 10 12 per person after tax 
cIkwtzEB1LkYohSz63LLYg CMU I went during the lunch rush but it was waaaayyyyyyyy too loud for me I had a guacamole themed salad but instead of actual guacamole it had this weird thin spicy guacamole style dressing which made me sad 
CIO9i2iR9T0xU2qqE74Wng CMU Okey 
CJmx6YfIuZpyVgOW3IJLDQ CMU Excellent vegetarian options excellent beer selection good non vegetarian options and an all you can eat bacon night The wait staff is awesome friendly and knowledgeable The average patron unfortunately isn t half as cool as the staff and I avoid the mixed drinks as the scotch and soda I had was just bad Plus there s an awesome patio but it s the smoking section unless that s changed Sunday brunch is also designed to cure the common hangover which isn t a bad plan 
CK72Z_H0JcelldMV-dW29A CMU It was a dark and stormy night er rainy afternoon This is the perfect spot when you re not sure what you re in the mood for With a little bit of everything it has some great specials and you can modify almost any item to your liking Union Grill was packed and embodied a where everybody knows your name vibe Other places we thought about going were on the empty side We ended up snagging bar seats the usual MO for us anyway The wait staff was so attentive They all shared the bar tending responsibilities so there was never a moment when no one was checking in on us You can tell this place runs like a well oiled machine The clientele ranged from college students to men in suits Decor lends itself to this range of customers as its very homey irish bar feeling Great place to grab a bite on your lunch break or sit down and chill for a couple hours with your favourite cronies a la How I Met Your Mother Prices were certainly reasonable and they had an expected range of beer on tap as well as a full bar The ciabatta chicken sandwich and the burger whichever version or toppings you get on either are fantastic I wish I had a place like this in my college town back in the day 
CqRWHjY5lQJd0C1_326duQ CMU Low key laid back atmosphere Beer was good and you certainly get your monies worth of food I ordered the Mahi Mahi sandwich with sweet potato chips I should have just eaten half of what was on my plate but I ate it all I liked how the dressing was on the side but the bread was deliciously coated and toasted in butter Mahi Mahi was cooked well not greasy which was what I was expecting but didn t have much flavor without the dressing Sweet potato chips were tasty with some ketchup Two other people ordered burgers and enjoyed but again the portions were large Another person ordered the Union fish sandwich which I almost ordered but didn t which I was glad for Perhaps it did taste good but when it came out it was basically two large very large pieces of deep fried fish that were ballooned up put into one sandwich Wish I had taken a picture of how funny looking it was No complaints nor anything to rave about Would eat here again if someone wanted to meet there but wouldn t come back here on my own 
cxjtKju-BmOhoZqbHrSmew CMU Great place to eat cheap wine delicious perogies My favorite menu item salmon Greek salad my husband says their Pittsburgh salad is his favorite in the city Convenient location in Oakland 
CxqykbkAEBm2oDl97LgrgA CMU Great bar food in gigantic portions I ve always been partial to the roast beef sandwiches with fries and gravy even though my doctor would probably frown upon me eating it I never knew it was on Diners drive ins and dives but that doesn t surprise me Big Jim s is a look at how good and how unique the City of Pittsburgh used to be 
cy4OISqb9vxA6yR0eKTYqA CMU One of my favorite things I ve ever heard Guy Fieri say is If you re from Pittsburgh you ve heard of The Run Guy I had not heard of the run and I have yet to meet anyone that prior to going to Big Jim s has heard of The Run either Except for my one friend s grandma However I ll not forget The Run a small stretch in Greenfield near the South Side Works involving a baseball field that has housed this place since 1977 after having come to Big Jim s Big Jim s is full of cheap largely portioned food that I think is characteristic of this area Little flair decent flavor no funny business Enter and take your pick of the dining room or the bar area There may be a wait I ve been here once or twice with a line out the door mostly during games Go another time and you re good to sit just about anywhere The crowd is a good mix neighbors locals Pitt students The menu is a selection of mostly fried appetizers sandwiches hoagies some Italian specialties and pizza My favorite item to get here is definitely the veggie hoagie So simple Good bread provalone cheese brocolli cauliflower onions peppers carrots thrown in the oven until the veggies are roasted Add mayo for me of course And sometimes a little ketchup This thing tastes amazing and while I could probably down a full one I prefer to share it with a side of some kind of appetizer The spaghetti here is also pretty good and I ve had the eggplant parmesian and it was decent The entrees will net you garlic bread and spaghetti and a salad large portions of everything so don t attempt them alone Now all that being said I do have a few gripes about this place Number one being that the service is slow My order usually takes about 20 30 minutes to come back to me which for a hoagie is kind of crazy in my opinion The staff is friendly and it s hard to get upset just don t come here for a quick bite My other gripe is that while some of the menu is definitely home cookin other parts of the menu are definitely not so buyer beware My girlfriend ordered the applesauce once 1 50 and about 15 minutes later but well before the rest of our food came the waitress handed her a generic plastic cup of applesauce not even opened I mean come on at least put the stuff in a dish But what are you gonna do The veggie hoagie is too good to pass up Just accept the stuff for what it is and don t try and go on the edge of this place s comfort zone Stick to what they do best and you won t be disappointed 
cY5r134FGZCOLELb6pEPgA CMU There are plenty of places to drink in Oakland but it can be tricky to find somewhere with alcohol and food AND where you can have conversations with people without shouting Union Grill fits the bill pretty well and has a cozy atmosphere to boot The hummus plate is a pretty good appetizer to share While the hummus isn t out of this world good it s decent Bonus points for warm pita triangles and the feta olives tomato and red onion also on the plate The pan fried pierogies served with plenty of sour cream and caramelized onion isn t too shabby either Though the appetizer is a bit on the small side just 3 pierogies Waffle fries also make for good sharing The chocolate silk pie is a solid choice as a dessert I ordered the spiked apple cider drink special and was surprised when it was a cold drink as opposed to a warm one It was delicious however and a good balance of apple cider and alcohol Waters and fountain sodas come in huge glasses here and the beer selection looked decent Overall this isn t a bad choice if you re in Oakland and not in the mood for a noisy bar 
CZtX_uFYD1inzZud55ksiw CMU The only reason I want to try this little dive tucked away on a barely lit street was because my dear dad saw it listed in one of his cooking magazines since it had been featured on DDD you know the show I mean I wish I knew what Guy recommended so I could decided what to try from the massive selection I am not a burger person but the hot pot roast and fries with gravy sounded pretty good to me When I saw the gigantic plate coming from the kitchen I knew right away I couldn t finish it For the price the portion size alone is a value I did also order Wedding soup Something I never even heard of before moving to Pittsburgh The soup itself was very delicious Not bland and with few meatballs which is FINE with me At least I didn t have to ask for the Parmesan cheese the server brought it out with the soup My meal itself was just okay The bread was kind of tough and hard to cut The beef didn t have much flavor but the gravy helped this The fries sadly tasted like the oil they were cooked in needed changed badly At first I though maybe it was just that there was still skin left on the potatoes but Darren pointed out the oil problem Another comment WHAT IS WITH THIS AREA AND CURT SERVERS If you aren t from Pittsburgh I think you ll be shocked at the rudeness Darren seems used to it swearing that they aren t being rude and if this is what you get used to here I am heartbroken Is friendly service too much to ask for If I decide to come back I will try a different sandwich 
d0dehIDHgLRGD5oc_y3KMw CMU Good Belgium beer selection Small patio even smaller bar Appears to always be very crowded regardless of time of day This place has a lot of neighborhood dive bar charm complete with tatt ed hipsters both server and served There is one dude with dreadlocks to his knees The locals observation of this guy is he is usually in a bad mood and rude I didn t interact with him so I cannot comment However I really don t like the idea of someone with hair that has been unwashed for more than 5 years handling my food or walking by food with 4 foot long dreadlocks which is why we only drank there The locals suggest that the reason he appears to be in a bad mood all the time is that he has not washed his hair in the past decade o We didn t eat but the beer selection was awesome There were several Belgium beers and our waitress was very good at suggesting some very good beers that I have not had before 
D1VyX9SAORvimR5qdaat-g CMU I m definitely a fan of Hem s It s a cute bar restaurant tucked in the Oakland university area If you come here don t expect haute cuisine or anyting too complicated It s a bar so expect bar ish food What you SHOULD expect is awesome drink prices selection and an extensive half price menu during select times Something like before 11am 2 4pm and after 9pm most things on the menu are 1 2 price The garlic parm wings with a side of fries is what I usually get and it s always great I wash it down with whatever draft specials they have They offer amazing draft specials daily 1 50 2 00 Yuengling pitchers for 5 50 and as other Yelper s have said very reasonably priced PITCHERS of shots with names like Tiger Woods Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus It gets busy on the weekends and after 9 in general I have come before on a Friday at 9 15 and was able to find a seat at the bar no problem and get a couple of drinks in before it got crowded and all hell broke loose 
d4tP_UPxQVgmrX8rsxzDeA CMU I had the tomato soup around 3 50 and a side order of macaroni and cheese around 4 50 The tomato soup is very peppery so if you don t like things spicy at all don t order it The macaroni was quite good I also tried the potato and cheese pierogies around 7 50 which I liked but it was my first time trying pierogies so I can t compare them to anything The waitstaff was quite pleasant The restaurant was noisy so possibly not the best place for people who are hard of hearing 
d7Bg-qDlrB6O1Z-9ePD9LQ CMU Being an outsider to Pittsburgh I wasn t expecting much before we walked into Harris Grill As soon as we entered it was clear that this place had a lot more ambiance The Pro s The menu is funny There are a fair number of vegetarian options which are clearly labeled The onion rings are amazing The portions are large you can get more than you fill for a good price They have root beer floats Our server was hilarious you know that self deprecating kind of humor The Con s There were a lot of items that had run out The service was a bit slow it took forever for that root beer float to come out Overall I d come back 
D8djdvmRP_llR0VOj0p5eQ CMU A first class neighborhood restaurant and bar Extensive menu of hoagies sandwiches burgers and some Italian pasta dishes For most folks I would recommend bringing a friend or love one and sharing an entree and a side The sandwiches are very big I had the veal parmigiana sandwich plus fried mushrooms and ended up with half in a carryout container Other than being huge my sandwich came in first class crusty toasty italian bread Very very tasty Parking behind the restaurant 
d9Xk3va01_GCnfvzqA_3pg CMU My first time in Pittsburgh I decided to eat here after walking around CMU The restaurant is a cozy place to sit down and enjoy your lunch The margarita was decent but their Cuban sandwich was great The portion was large Definitely American style I ll definitely come here again 
dcY62_X2Ubrzju5eZvxGRQ CMU meh nothing too special but definitely not bad and trust me there is some BAD food here in pittsburgh blegh they just survive off of poor students unfortunately anyway i came here for their half of food late at night but unfortunately got something that wasn t half off i think its a pizza maybe but also had some other dish that was half off not bad not great just come for cheap food 
DFeWVDnn0yuNAlLABge7fw CMU Loved it Great dancing great drinks great crowd loved the music videos The DJ was a bit of a jerk but I wouldn t want drunk people setting drinks near my equipment either I loved that he would randomly play the electric drums during the songs he was playing Really cute I would come here all the time if I lived in PGH 
dgFoKQqOE_CfOyBOnnJjnA CMU If you re in Oakland with friends who are divided on drinking vs eating Fuel and Fuddle is a good compromise big beer selection to satisfy the drinkers and plenty of food options to keep the eaters happy The portions here are really generous While not listed directly on the menu you can request a side of just sweet potato fries instead of the mix of regular and sweet potato fries and the plate you get is huge The pizzas here are pretty good with thin crusts that are nicely chewy The dessert portions here are the largest I ve ever seen the brownie is about three or four times larger than the typical bar brownie and the nutter butter pie is the tallest peanut butter pie I ve seen I like how Fuel and Fuddle tried to put its own twist on the apple turnover with the apple burnover by using pizza dough instead of puff pastry The dough itself however could have been more sweet even with warm apple filling inside the chocolate sauce drizzled on top and the vanilla ice cream I felt the dessert lacked something As other reviewers have said this isn t a place to go to if you want to have conversations In a party of six I had to stick to talking to the people right next to me and even then I felt like I was nearly shouting The food and drinks here aren t bad at all but not quite enough to convince me to frequent this place if I m not already in Oakland 
dGkyEJpSjM-E29eC5pLaMg CMU I love ethnic cuisine but I don t usually get excited about American food It tends to be bland boring and greasy The union grill is a notable exception It s food is all fresh flavorful and extremely reasonably priced for massive portions Also the wine prices are the cheapest I ve seen and you can BYOB without paying a corkage fee Whether you want gourmet burgers sandwiches pasta or salads this is your best bet in Oakland 
dGlQDghJQHrHC6wdr9xSMQ CMU I love the calzones and that seems to be the best thing on the menu The spicy meat Calzone might be the best folded pizza I ve ever had Portions are Huge WE did see a pasta being ordered once HUGE HUGE HUGE The only other thing worth a visit for is the new breakfast It is a grease heaven The potatoes are kicking but huge in number Pancakes put the word cake back in the equation It feels really good after a drinking night and I recommend it But go for the calzones They are HUGE imagine large pizza folded for maybe 8 bucks or something amazing Feeds 3 4 EASILY I barely barely can eat a fourth and i love my food know what I mean Owners really nice to Overall solid Greenfield place 
dh01KBnsNK0TgcC75VUjDA CMU Huge fish sandwiches not as good as North Park Lounge but still pretty good Great waffle fries too Happy hour is after 5 so hit it up for some after work drinks 
DhAA_u-pTIw_iEw0elMnFw CMU There will always be a soft spot in my heart for Fuel Fuddle and I think it s safe to say all other Pitt grads feel the same way Good food good people and darn good selection of beer Everyone will tell you that their sweet potato fries are a must They are awesome so don t miss out Most people will say you have to try Fuel s wings or Rosemary s Breasts which are fine but honestly I d have to recommend the Classic Veg Head and the Smashed Potato They put the Veg Head sandwich in the brick oven just long enough so the provolone cheese melts over the hummus and veggies it is phenomenal And who would have thought smashed potato on a pizza would work but believe me it does Plus there s bacon and ranch dressing to help solidify just how good it is Fuel is not a big place so be prepared to wait for a table but it s completely worth it 
dHHp56fluc2WrYNvh21GIA CMU My friends and I always used to get a kick out of going for ghetto Korean food as we called it I loved the spicy fried noodles I tend to like everything to be spicy but this stuff was to the level you could barely eat it I dont know why but that made it all the more appealing to me Yum I do miss those noodles 
DqxSOcpL8LN48qCmhgQ4jw CMU Good specials Average food Poor service Very crowded even on a weekday in the summer time 
DrckXags0UD9fpyczrIQvQ CMU We went to Harris Grill for lunch while a friend was visiting from out of town and it was fun The menu and atmosphere is pretty entertaining The food and drinks are moderately priced and there is a nice selection of brews What we had Turkey Burger fabulous we agreed this was the best thing we had I added mozzarella cheese and it was soooo good Flat Iron Pork I guess our friend thought he was ordering flat iron steak this was ok but I wouldn t get it again Some Spicy Chicken sandwich Pretty good paled in comparison to the turkey burger Tots Delicious Beer good duh Other Service Fab 2 Patios front and back 
dSxIKhtdO8NQ0o54_zI4rA CMU I ve only been here on nights during the school year and yikes The front room is claustrophobic and though the back isn t as packed good luck trying to have a conversation at a normal speaking volume Even though I m only in my mid twenties I feel way old and crochety among the people who clog the place As other reviewers have said you can t beat the price of the beer specials here The cardiac stix deep fried provolone sticks and the spinach artichoke dip served with deep fried pita bread slices are pretty decent appetizers to share The low prices might encourage you to order more but the waitstaff can be so elusive that you ll just end up asking for your check the next time you see your server If cheap beer and food are your top priorities and atmosphere matters very little then Hemingway s will do I d rather walk a little farther from Pitt and go to Panther Hollow Inn near the corner of Forbes and Craig 
dTr7sSdAHho0ZGcr2ZEp1g CMU Let me begin this by saying that the reason they are getting this rating is for lack of consistency I was a shadyside resident for quite sometime and spent many afternoons and evenings in Shady Grove and Walnut Grill Shady Grove has been the less consistent of the two for me over the years For New Years Eve this year my friends made dinner reservations for us at Walnut Grill and then we went downstairs for drinks and to ring in 2012 This review is only about Shady Grove as my experiences at Walnut Grill have been pretty good Shady grove food is good and the drinks are reasonably priced The space is cool and in the summer they have outdoor seating which I love Wine nights on Wednesdays cannot be beat half priced bottles all evening The reason for the 3 rating The service is SO inconsistent I ve had visits where my service is appalling and then visits where my service is grand When I say appalling I mean a waitress poured water on my feet and all over the floor and told me not to slip when I left rather than giving me a towel to dry my freezing toes And even on NYE the service was very inconsistent One bartender would be great Another would be just awful horrible attitude ignoring sections of the bar etc It is really a shame It seems like certain employees in particular a broad fellow with dark hair not wearing the uniform perhaps a manager are there just to meet girls and act like a hot shot He was behind the bar not serving anyone as if to give the impression that he owns the place which I know he does not and was hitting on a girl in my group HARD He was just trying to look like a big shot Annoying Make a drink for the people waiting and stop trying to hook up with uninterested women Thanks That being said it is usually a cool crowd there Great location Usually I have no trouble finding parking So all in all Good food Good Vibe Good drinks Some great servers Some crabby servers Big guy with the dark hair Try to get laid on your own time Happy New Year 
DvSI43YyWKrrn3_XzkER7w CMU Pretty nice Though this Quaker Steak didn t have waiters very different atmosphere than most 
DzDGCU-F8IuJ_PSjZU4WXg CMU Probably the best place to eat on Craig Street I only started going here last year and was immediately hooked The Kobe mini burgers are my staple food there along with the shoestring fries If I go with friends we usually end up getting a bottle of wine from their 10 wine list The service is generally good and the ambience is really pleasant I usually see a lot of older Pittsburghers there They have TV s there which is usually tuned to any game that is airing It looks a lot more expensive from the outside than it actually is Would definitely recommend it to anyone 
d_WMxR0vNeMXaAkSHVWV0A CMU This is a good deli in a surprisingly deli absent shadyside I was here on Saturday afternoon with a friend who suggested We walked in and the space was pretty open with a great beer selection and plenty of plasmas displaying everything from Tennis to Soccer The service was okay but nothing special I tried the motza ball soup which was a little below average The chicken broth was tasty enough but the motza had a stale flavor maybe I had the russell which was roast beef marinated in barbecue served on really good bread with hot pepper cheese and onions This reminds me of a beef bbq at the world famous bob s sub in slippery rock pa It was pretty good but maybe should have tried the cuban My friend ordered a turkey wrap which looked okay but I don t think she was too impressed The curly fries she ordered were a nice option Overall this is a c deli which probably couldn t cut it in squirrel Hill and wouldn t last a week in NYC That being said I d go here anytime if I was in shadyside and needed a sandwich 
E2ss0O-DONm45Ddlmf1k_g CMU Great bar with good food Stay away from the crab cakes but the pizzas and salads are very good One of the better beer selections in Oakland Try the BIG fish sandwich 
e3ZrBvGs7bYN-Q9NurnOXA CMU I m at school at CMU so I ve only really been here to drink and to have fun never for a meal So how much you enjoy this place definitely depends on what you re looking for At night college kids will flood this place and the atmosphere might get a little claustrophobic But if on the other hand if you are one of those college kids Hemingways is definitely a good place to be They have really cheap beer pitchers each night and they re really well known for their 7 dollar shot pitchers The half price food there at night is also really good I especially love the cloggen fries mmm bacon 
E5Q0Sa28b0zLQbJSuOwY3Q CMU Decent prices for above average food I highly recommend the fish tacos Good place for a lunch in Oakland 
EbaVAnSdwRAbJ4pEA2CjJQ CMU Moving here from DC maybe I just expect too much as far as service but I feel like my expectations in this case are standard Their food is delicious there drinks are yummy I have just been consistently disappointed by their service Even if they are semi busy the waitresses seem to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off Though the bartenders have their act together I came here on Monday evening around 6 630 I ordered the Fajita wrap I took two bites and then noticed there was a small brown hair in my fries My hair is long and black so clearly it wasn t mine When I told the waitress she very professionally exclaimed shit and came over I told her I lost my appetite and just asked for a new order to go I waited until my friend finished her meal and then asked for the check My waitress plopped mine down in front of me Seriously I ate human hair at your venue and you re going to charge me for that You ve officially made my shit list 
eBhM2imVmyo8S8d8LpGs0Q CMU PHI bar has two great things going for it cheap prices and great location for CMUers It s a great place to hang out seeing as they unlike some other nearby bars aren t blasting horrid pop music so loud that you can t hear anyone a foot away It does have a dive y feel to it and always has a strong smoke smell of which I m not a big fan You can be sure to run into a few folks you know if you pop in 
EDA0kEur0PwH52WxzQJ3GQ CMU Hem s is great if you re looking for some decent bar food at a great price or to get drunk on a budget The only problem is that every other person in Oakland is looking to do the same thing After 9 00 on pretty much any night of the week you ll be fighting 100 other people for your spot on the floor or at the bar or for the bartender s attention That being said if yo re looking to get drunk you won t care and you ll love the 2 00 drafts for anything even Troegenator after 10 Pitchers of shots are also a favorite Miley Cyrus while a girly name will kill you with liquor The jukebox is playing pretty traditional party rap or metal depending on who gets to it first The bartenders are generous and totally on top of their game It s really a spectacular level of service for such a busy bar The lunchtime crowd is a lot more chill it s a great place to sip a beer and eat a good wrap or burger for cheap BOTTOM LINE Good food and drinks cheap great service very crowded loud great for a night out to get hammered with a college crowd not great for trying to chill out 
edR8VVf44L3GBt6hLk7RYw CMU Angela C could not be more accurate I m troubled to give it a 2 or 3 but I ll go with the 3 because its just so freakin cheap Weirdest place ever though the randomly gigantic selection of alcohol the underground entrance and the mere fact that its korean fast food The food is mostly not that great except for the fried rice which is beyond tasty And its like 3 75 or something ridiculous So you can get a soda and fried rice which will more than fill you up with just a 5 bill This place is fun though check it out for sure 
edTorHBELrIWpa0jZuYJSQ CMU This place wasn t as good as we were expecting My pizza Classic Maggie was good but nothing outstanding My husband s burger was completely charred and basically inedible We didn t bother sending it back as our waitress was nowhere to be found It s your typical bar food with a decent beer selection nothing more nothing less 
ef8gwQPRNNpyiLkfSN34qg CMU I ate at the Harris Grill for the first time last night and it was fantastic It will not be my last time there The staff was very friendly and welcoming I ordered a Surly Temple which was cherry and fizzy and perfect for enjoying It was a tad cool on the front patio to enjoy the whole drink but this will definitely be my summer drink My boyfriend and I started out with the hummus and pita bread I ate half of it before he had any Oops It was really great hummus I could have stopped here and been really happy but I was hungry so I ordered the mac and cheese and added grilled chicken Oh holy cow This mac and cheese is cheesy but not overly so It s the perfect amount of gooey for mac and cheese The chicken was seasoned tender and not dry Great mac and cheese I m already looking forward to my next trip to Harris Grill 
egEn0xSUe5L7ZTBb___eLw CMU JED is a very rude man who is on a power trip and only likes males who go there He is very impolite and doesn t know how to treat customers Definitely wouldn t recommend this bar because there are a lot of better places in shadyside to enjoy 
EGxx26sHLP92So7TqLBzRw CMU The wing deliciousness is worth the mess Wings are always cooked perfectly and the sauce selection is super My personal favorite is Arizona Ranch but Hot is good too I split 5 Atomic wings with a friend once and only made it through 2 which required 3 cups of soda You only need one Atomic wing experience per lifetime There is nothing fancy about Quaker Steak And there is no steak Go with a group and split a couple team buckets to get a sampling of flavors You ll get nice warm hand wipes at the end of your meal and sometimes even some twizzlers if the staff isn t too busy Only downside Be careful around football season They literally run out of wings during major games 
EISraFWnCRELIYtTfFPjng CMU Harris Grill is a good Pittsburgh standby a place I like popping by when I m back in town The atmosphere you get is so mixed though depending on which crevice of the joint you get stuck in The upstairs corners are invariably awkwardly cold or quiet but the patio is awesome The quality of the food is also as mixed Sometimes the burgers are absolutely scrumptious sometimes they re overcooked and chewy Whatever I like it anyway Bacon night frozen cosmos What more do you want 
EItZ9N5Umr7-XtuuhItOUg CMU The food was good but nothing to blow your mind The portions were huge all of us ended up getting a doggy bag and I m a fatty so that s saying something I would check it out if you are in the neighborhood Prices ranged from 9 22 so you could eat for cheap if you wanted 
EjDA9mhUsXkrvq3MdHUQ-w CMU I would never for any reason eat here during the school year mid August until May The food is just not THAT good if you know what I mean The place is also small with too many small jammed together tables and is pretty loud even in the summer in the afternoon That said I have eaten here several times and the food has always been fine I usually get the rosemary chicken or campfire steak and potatoes salad Those have both been consistently good My husband usually gets one of the chicken wraps and they have also been decent They give you a mix of russet and sweet potato fries if you get them when they just come out of the fryer both are pretty good But we have also gotten some cold stale ones They still don t taste horrible but you won t be raving about them We totally skip appetizers here they are small and over priced Two small medium sized vegetable egg rolls cut in half for 7 00 dollars seems a bit insane especially since you can get ones that are a superior quality less oily and the filling isn t mush right around the corner for 1 25 a piece Next would be service honest it s probably the reason why we don t come here more often Your order is taken quick and the food always comes reasonably fast but on more than one occasion our server has never came back until she we ve never had a male server drops the check off We usually tip around 20 for good service this place we consistently tip less Servers and hostesses have a tendency to gather near the back toward the hallway to the restrooms talking to one another or using their cell phones 
Eke1SRMGRmIVUz158w_fKA CMU love it empty little hidden spot with amazing tasting and priced sandwiches i got full on a 5 half sandwich the beer is too expensive but all else is great 
ElQbOAIKJfYaAryy0IyHWA CMU We came here for the cheap drinks so I can t speak on behalf of the food The place was packed with undergrads and it was a tuesday night The draft selection is much better than I expected and luckily it was 2 draft night They also have 5 pitchers of miller all the time The service was friendly but it was extremely slow They also have a large girlie drink menu and each drink comes with a candy necklace or a ring pop 
EMGYfc3b_MqLOYB5_ZEFbQ CMU Harris Grill and I spent an amazing Saturday morning together a few months ago when I was suffering from a near death hangover It brought me back to life with two stellar Bloody Marys they were half price a salad topped with locally made cheese curds absolutely perfect even for a shaky stomach and hot crispy wings not half price but so tasty I ordered seconds anyway The restaurant was slow so it was nice and quiet while my Advil settled in The bartender was on the water refills like a hawk but was chill enough to leave me and my dining companion in peace while we ate it is impossible to overvalue an observant bartender The menu descriptions are on the rambling side but that s okay because they re pretty funny And I wouldn t be a competent reviewer if I didn t mention that every Tuesday the bars are lined with baskets of free bacon You read that right bacon is their bar snack They have a huge outdoor seating area that I plan on taking advantage of late into Pittsburgh s warm summer nights they re open until 2 a m every day except Sunday 
eoHPzrQlTPokgyX5-iv44g CMU Honest American Food That s what the door reads and Union Grill stays true it s tagline Despite Tessaro s claiming the best burger in Pittsburgh Union Grill s Artisanal Cheeseburger is my favorite especially when the cheese that month is Swiss Gruyere The steakburger base handily trumps the crumbly patty at Tessaro s While the local has toppings that sound good I found it disappointing and have since ordered the Artisanal another half dozen times On days when I didn t need any more beef I ve tried the fish sandwich and the fish taco both which use a huge fish n chips style fried filet overflowing whatever piece of carbs it happens to be between They are a good value but don t match the awesomeness of the Artisanal Union Grill also has a rotating tap reasonably priced and if you ever see Anderson Valley Summer Solstice it is a must drink Once I even left my credit card here and they didn t mind me stopping by after they closed to pick it up Nowadays anytime I suggest a restaurant other than Union Grill to my Iranian friend he has to ask but is it honest American food To which I reply havercrafte man pore mrmhi ast 
ERaLNTsWjxj8Hjb7qa1Y4w CMU I m so annoyed at Harris Grill right now IT S MY OWN FAULT But I still can t help but be annoyed My friend and I came here on a Sunday for their half off bloody marys It s around the corner and I trust their bartending skills since I have rarely had a bad drink here The bloody mary was pretty good A little weak but it was cheap If I had stopped here I would have been happy But then we got hungry and decided to order food I know I know I already detailed how lame their food is in my last review and you d think I d know better and just avoid it at this point but for whatever reason it seemed like a good idea at the time Calamari was good but the sauce was too sweet The delmonico steak sandwich had pretty good flavor actually but it was so fatty that it became a chore to eat The mac cheese was lukewarm and tasted of velveeta But you know I expected all this But oh WOW is this place overpriced And I knew that too but it was highlighted to me on a Sunday morning when our bill came to 42 Not expensive but the wheels started turning in my head we just paid 42 for an appetizer two entrees and two bloodys all of which were eh passable For exactly 6 more before tip we could have went to Casbah and had TWO appetizers two entrees and two much stronger bloodys all of much higher quality What was I thinking It s official I am done with the food at Harris Grill Drinks only I MEAN IT THIS TIME 
et4CYUlZ0E0mhtry_rx9FA CMU There hours here are what attracts me the most especially last semester when I was up until 6am doing Networks and needed coffee The coffee here is actually good especially if you get a shot in it The espresso are eh And the pizzas are pretty greasy In fact most of the food here isn t that great but when it s hot a fro yo comes in quite handy 
Etnvm5Bbt-1QHad0CpUkdA CMU As much as I ve enjoyed my awkward trips to F F I can t explain what s so great about it The service is average during normal hours and understandably terrible during half price The crowds of fellow college students means I m sometimes in the cold for upwards of half an hour waiting for a table And by the time I m done the buses aren t necessarily running so I have to walk home in the cold But it s still quintessentially college to me so I keep coming back I actually don t like most of the food The vegetarian sandwich I got was kind of bland and the bread was pretty terrible Not a fan of the pizzas or nachos either though I know some people are crazy about them It seems overpriced for the quality except maybe during half price but then you re tipping double and possibly ordering drinks so you re not saving a ton of money Some pluses they have a terrific beer selection or so I m told I don t drink beer and great wings again I don t eat them But I do eat the sweet potato fries mmm only 1 for a side of sweet fries if you re here after 11 pm 
eu01qTInp9jnacRIVOqsAg CMU Another stop on my Pittsburgh culinary adventure was the Union Grill It has a reputation for one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh so I thought I would give it a try As it was known for its burgers I decided to give the UG blue burger a try This was a burger with a healthy does of blue cheese on top They had several burgers to choose from including the artisanal UG burger that had different artisanal cheeses every day to try on your burger A Gouda was the cheese available when I was there but I still went for the blue cheese The burger itself was actually some type of steak burger I am not sure what exactly the ratio they used for it but it was a little lean for my liking The blue cheese they used was delicious and with the lettuce and onion it made for an overall nice burger They definitely could improve on the meat For my side I picked the waffle fries which got good reviews They were pretty good but nothing spectacular They remind me of the waffle fries from Carl s Jr You don t get a lot of places that offer waffle fries so I consider it a pretty good option The service was good The atmosphere was nice Overall the place was a good stop that I would recommend but for a place that is considered one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh the meat paddy needed to be a bit better 
Ev0XXBl-m9UsfVefaFIqaw CMU Disguised as a wood stove restaurant Fuel and Fuddle also serves as a beer lover s emporium As an undergrad student at the University of Pittsburgh I often would head over to Fuel and Fuddle during the late night hours for its unique takes on classic American cuisine But it wasn t until I took a seat at the small bar in the corner that I realized I was in a place that was so much more than just a good place to eat The beer selection is amazing literally hundreds of brews to choose from including pale ales porters IPAs stouts you name it and Fuel and Fuddle has it On the wall behind the bar hangs the names of people who have at least tried 100 different beers I even saw a plaque celebrating a patron who tried 1000 different beers Count that 1000 beers That s pretty impressive Around ten beers are on tap each one is a different style giving the beer lover a great number of options to choose from If the draft beers don t fancy your tastes then you ll surely find a beer you love in the selection of over 500 bottled beers in stock For its selection of unique beers Fuel and Fuddle s prices are varied Draft domestics are as cheap as 2 00 but some of the rare micro brews and import bottles can be upwards of 10 so if you are drinking on a budget it might be in your interest to check the price with the bartender before you order If you are looking for rowdy drunken foolery Fuel and Fuddle is not your place The bar area is entirely too small for anything than merely drinking Furthermore if you are trying to find a place to watch a game Fuel and Fuddle isn t really suited for that either The TV s are small and positioned at awkward angles coupled with the noise level from the restaurant makes it impossible to hear any of the commentary Fuel and Fuddle is best suited as a kick off to a night or a place to get a couple drinks after dinner For a beer lover the selection is unmatched anywhere in Oakland and can compete with any place in the city For it s beer selection I recommend this bar to beer lovers passing through Oakland 
EvSclCyltEn-DcKRz6yYnw CMU Drinks I make sure to go to Harris Grill whenever I consider going out for happy hour They have the best and cheapest frozen cosmos in the area Boy does that drink hit you hard You don t need too many of those pink babies I ve gotten a bunch of other drinks that were all delicious and strong Food I am a vegetarian and they have lots of veggie friendly menu options The hummus platter is really good and so is the veggie burger Watch out for desserts though They are always huge servings that you might think are for two but once you taste them you ll decide otherwise I recommend the ice cream with cookie dough concoction AMAZING I am generally not a fan of cheesecake but theirs is sooo sinful Menu The menu is huge Sometimes during drinks me and my friends just pour over the menu for entertainment There are so many options to choose from and i love how the descriptions of the all the food and drinks are so witty and funny 
eW9ahRxjlBpKt02gzMDoog CMU Went here on a working lunch and had the crab cake sandwich In hindsight I should ve tried the fish sandwich which they claim can t be eaten by one person alone The food was fine though and it was relatively inexpensive Decent lunch place 
EYezaNNyWp1MfGq9BiN4sw CMU Good if you have a wing craving although the wings could be meatier Extensive sauce choices but limited menu otherwise Long waits between ordering and tray pick up at the name calling window Overall the wings should be better for a wing focused joint 
F-J9lFkek_sMHFRsdwKt2w CMU Shady Grove has good food They have wraps salads and pizzas and a servicable beer mix drink menu It s a good place to go and have a conversation over dinner not that it s quiet but I remember having a good conversation every time I ve gone there After 10 they go 21 and have cheap pitchers 
f0DIKc1yDj8XWb9LnooNYA CMU Food the food at Harris grill is the epitome of average nothing is great and nothing is terrible everything is mediocre there are plenty of options for vegetarians and they have an unnatural love of bacon here the appetizers are more interesting than the entrees Price too expensive for the quality of the food the prices aren t staggering but considering the quality of the food it feels like you are overpaying for nearly everything Drinks beer is one of the strengths of Harris always a good selection of draft beers and an extensive bottle beer list the mixed drinks are all average to below average though and the bartenders do not mix good drinks aside from the signature Frozen Cosmo I would stay away from everything including the mojito Atmosphere this is what you pay for at Harris they have a beautiful porch for outdoor seating in the front an equally nice back porch and the inside decor is pleasant as well the menus are very cleverly organized and a lot of personality was put into the presentation Service the service is average at best we have had meals and specific orders confused multiple times service is also slow great location great atmosphere good beer overpriced food poor service worse bartending Would I go back again Only because I live nearby 
fc2bu3oFgFXPJm12-TXfww CMU I love this place I had an artisanal cheeseburger yesterday s cheese was manchego and it was beautiful My burger came medium rare just like I ordered it It was juicy tender and perfect I felt like I was eating a steak I really don t like burgers but this burger I would go back anyday One thing I had a problem with was the shoestring fries Okay like I feel like they took leftover parts of a potato and just tossed it in oil and called them fries They are hard tasteless and oily I ate 5 6 trying to salvage some taste but utterly failed However the waffle fries are AMAZING I ve never had waffle fries before and I have now declared them my favorite kind My friend got the Pittsburgh salad I tried some and decided that I would have a burger over the salad any day However the salad was decent though it seemed like a burger without a bun replaced with chicken and with more added lettuce It had everything else a burger had like sauteed mushrooms grilled onions cheddar cheese chunky tomato etc I definitely recommend this place 
FeLWta0BHwArB9NxuEtlHA CMU Went to Shady Grove this afternoon and sat at the bar for a quick lunch It was anything but I originally went to order one of their taters a loaded baked potato and the server told me sorry we don t have them and that we are in the process of changing the menu Thanks then I waited 25 minutes for her to bring my second choice The BBQ chicken wrap was okay as far as nourishment is concerned I wouldn t go back It looks like a cute cafe from the outside but its clear this place is a bar serving bar food with bar service and bar atmosphere 
FflTzxCOx4Dgu4COf1sl6A CMU I only give this place two stars not so much for the food but for the experience I went here when I was visiting my bro at school He had loved it especially the wings But for some reason it took about 45 minutes for our food to come out on a Saturday afternoon The place was not packed We ordered burgers So the wait was a bit ridiculous On top of that they brought out my salad without the dressing I ordered It was just a hot mess I ll give them this though the wings were yummy 
fH7XiXAvmEQeGi6f5BBDew CMU Maybe I have been ordering the wrong menu items but the only thing I have tried that was really good was the baked brie They also serve decent desserts I have never tried it but the Turkey Devonshire was featured on the Food Network The Buffalo Chicken sandwich was really messy and not very good During another visit I had some kind of other chicken sandwich that was completely smothered in bleu cheese The last time I went I ordered a burger cooked to medium It was very undercooked to the point of being practically raw As they were very busy I didn t mention the problem to the waitress who seemed friendly but overwhelmed The restaurant itself has a nice neighborhood bar and grill vibe If I ever go back I would probably just sit at the bar and get appetizers 
fikusx9xKS8qEjXjAV0vBg CMU Giant portions Unless you re really hungry or big you should expect to take some home Consistently good food and their specials keep the menu interesting The seafood I ve had here has been just okay I recommend the Five Hour Pot Roast the Reuben and the burgers 
FkNF2vGtMzXLPdMieNYD9g CMU I m completely hooked on this place it s my favorite for a good treat lunch cozy excellent hearty food and consistant It is a little on the pricey side for a soup or sandwich but in my opinion completely worth it The young kids that man the register are really friendly and helpful even letting you taste the soup of the day if you re curious and the food is always delicious Personally I m a fan of the Tijuana Tuna but I haven t tried anything there that I haven t liked 
FKtragTffxFYvXHCjqD65A CMU I walk by here on the way to work and spied some amazing looking humus waffle fries and burgers sitting on tables on the patio more than once so I decided to take my mom and sister when they visited Stupidly I ordered a salad which was only fine So think of this review as actually more like with extra stars potentially reserved for when I go back and order the dishes that looked good enough to lure me in there to begin with 
FO1gIE0yJHGJ0roggmzB5A CMU The food here is solid bar food with big portions Turkey Devonshire is a Pittsburgh specialty and the cheese sauce on it is heavenly We had a nice lunch at the bar the bartender couldn t have been nicer but I had a major issue with the woman they have as hostess She is a younger brunette with a bob and serious lack of social skills and customer service She turned people away had to pry it out of her that you could order food at the bar When I asked her if we could see menus as we sat at the bar she was 5 ft from me putting menus back into the stack of 50 behind her she said only the bartender could give them to us They are the same exact menus FYI What really put me over the edge is how she stared at this 85 year old woman with a walker who made he way off the street in 85 degree temperature I got up to open the door for the woman as the hostess stared blankly at her like what the hell do you want This poor lady is getting her walker stuck on the carpet about to trip and the hostess was flat out cold dismissive toward her It s really a shame because I love the restaurant and this particular woman and het attitude do not fit in with the character of the restaurant as a whole 
FOKsAXfV8jP-AY9hO_KRMg CMU Ugh So not good food although maybe that s because I was forced to eat here way too many times when I was on the CMU meal plan The pizza is pretty bad although the paninis are decent but small If you aren t on the mealplan this is overpriced and not worth your time During off hours this can be a fun place to sit around with friends cozy couches and nice windows to look out of But during peak hours you definitely won t be able to find a seat Only redeeming factor IMHO froyo Usually 2 flavors are available and it s pretty cheap about 2 Great for when you re having a rough day and just need a sweet treat 
fOsjLsG4t-M5LXuO9FjE7Q CMU If you re a beer lover then you will LOVE this place Not only is their beer selective expansive it is also top notch Just about every time I visit I order something new to try with the help of their knowledgeable bartenders It s dark and gives off a bit of a moody feel but that is awesome when it is crazy hot outside and you re trying to escape the sun s death rays So far the food has been sort of hit or miss for me The first time I visited even though I was definitely having a good time I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and took about two bites It was terrible Even the waitress admitted that it definitely was not one she liked and she was nice enough to take it off the bill for me though I did not ask Their meatloaf is killer and I highly recommend ordering it with a side of sweet potato fries In fact if you aren t very hungry you should order a half and half mix of their regular and sweet potato fries The fries are soooo good here I wonder how many times I can put fries into this one paragraph I have also had a few of their pizzas and only had one bad experience their margherita pizza I m pretty sure it was just the cook that particular visit but it was just awful Not just flavor wise though it was more of a cheese pizza than a margherita I picked up a slice and all of my toppings fell through the back No joke The bottom of the entire pizza was so soggy it couldn t hold together Which also makes for an unpleasant experience in your mouth in case you were unaware All in all I would recommend a visit to Fuel Fuddle if you are in the area Be careful in regards to parking finding a space on the street is usually impossible and a quarter will only get you 7 1 2 minutes in the meter 
fTJaT6EawyTQ9YTXB6C7jQ CMU I can t believe this place hasn t gotten more 5 star reviews People This is as good as it gets well at least when it comes to drinks and blackened chicken sandwiches Henny Penny I ve been to all sorts of places pubs restaurants cities and tried variations of the Henny Penny and this is the ultimate in blackened chicken sandwiches Overall I really like the vibe of this place It s totally unpretentious although it s in a very prententious part of the city The crowd is usually laid back and it s a great place to hang out with some friends grab some drinks and eat some killer food So what are you waiting for get yourself a Henny Penny 
FxfcmQ0njdfWYfEbZoUCqw CMU If there is a bar that totally identifies with and even cherishes the fact it is a full blown college hang out it is Hemingway s located at 3911 Forbes Avenue in Oakland Its central location on the Pitt Campus draws a very young crowd looking to have a good time without traveling too far Though Hemingway s has some great specials daily 1 75 beers all day long and a stellar beer selection the set up of this bar reduces its appeal It is narrow to begin with and coupled with an awkward raised seating area spanning the middle complicates patron mobility On a busy night it often takes five minutes to walk from the front to the back of the bar Hemingway s has a pool table and dart board located in the back but they are squeezed into a room entirely too small often making a game of billiards an unpleasant experience One aspect Hemingway s really has going for it is its staff The same bartenders have been working here for as long as I can remember and they are good at what they do Fast and efficient even when the bar is at full capacity they never short you on liquor in your mix drinks Hemingway s also employs a number of wait staff to take food and drink orders and are a convenient option on packed nights The food here is not bad and come between 9 and 11 and entrees are half off Options from wraps to burgers to pasta dishes highlight the menu Don t expect anything great Just the normal cheap bar food The decor at Hemingway s is unique Thousands of framed pictures of drunk college bar goers cover every wall a fitting choice for a college bar It never gets old laughing at all the drunkards pictured here In conclusion I think this bar is most suited for the newly turned 21 crowd When you get a littler older especially after graduation from college the patronage here seems a bit juvenile That being said if you re looking for a cheap night out and some decent bar food for a great price then stop by Hemingway s 
F_YCpzKld3rcZJGRBLN9hQ CMU What s not to like about this place Small and divey with a mix of regulars and CMU students The bartenders are quick and friendly The central catholic coaching staff would often stop by here after a game for a couple drinks and have always been treated well by the owner and staff The pizza and sandwiches are good and do the trick when you are drinking The prices are very reasonable but a little bit on the pricer side when you compare them to the rest of cheap ass oakland Like we used to say about Oakland all you need is ten dollars and you will be blacked out FYI the scribblings in the bathroom are hilarious sill wondering who FREEZA is 
G54mDs52O7EwQGxKjX7tpw CMU Absolutely AWESOME place to go for late night Bar is great and the menu for late night is fantastic They literally have everything that you can imagine I always get the psychedelic wrap with the portabella mushrooms Wish that the fries were half off at late night too The only reason I m not giving them 5 stars is because the wait is impossibly long at night wish they were better with moving people along 
gauiinmEEMgSUydfb1G_-A CMU went here the other day for an early dinner we had to wait until our WHOLE party was there as it was their policy granted the place was only 10 filled but i understand the reasons the server was super nice he was attentive and let us have room to talk and i always appreciate that he even was nice with my ordering questions sadly my rainbow trout was dry i mean DRY even though its grilled i ve had fish that wasnt this dry no one wanted a piece of my fish because they saw how dry it was but why does union grill gets 3 stars well thankfully my fellow dining companions got the scallop and gave me a piece it was perfectly done i m not sure how you get scallop right and fish wrong but o well bad days do happen we got the brownie dessert that was HUGE it was yummy but anything with chocolate and ice cream will be amazing overall i enjoyed it will this be my first choice in pittsburgh maybe not but i wouldnt mind coming here again popcorn served at bar is super cute idea and loved the gesture over peanuts 
gBWdgQb8-0w8JeSOBQyAFQ CMU I was recently in town attending a conference and I had the opportunity to eat at Union Grill I was impressed how lively the place was more activity then what I would expect for a Tuesday night although that may have been influenced by the beginning of school The food was excellent My only complaint was with the waiter up until it was time to pay he was very pleasant He assumed that we would either pooling our money to pay the bill or that one person would be picking up the tab we informed him that we would need separate tabs and his mood changed dramatically Since our group was above the number in which the tip would be automatically added in had no risk in acting the way he did 
GDce6C5c2ESExhN7M0VdxQ CMU There s nothing really special here The service is slow at the bar and the tables the place is crowded with Affliction Ed Hardy T shirt wearing type guys The music is truly terrible dance pop nonsense The food is forgettable without being bad think Chilis or Outback On the plus side they do have some good beers available But this is Pittsburgh and that s not unusual at all In fact you can walk a few blocks say to Bites and Brews or Harris Grill and get an even better selection usually for the same price or better 
GfUUMLgE8Cn_mDKDyyK_vg CMU High quality deli diner kind of food Can get very busy during lunch and only open weekdays There is a daily specials board which tend to have more misses than hits in my experience crab cakes were too wet and fell apart and I am not sure about cheese on pulled pork If they were better at pulling these off I would definitely award another star Menu items like the open face pot roast sandwich is very well executed Moderately priced for good size portions I would definitely recommend the Cafe over the UPMC Presbyterian 11th floor cafeteria 
GHv0rOniZ4pvW-iP4bn20A CMU Atmosphere downstairs was nice and cozy with the fireplace roaring Upstairs was a bit chilly and we were seated in front of a huge window overlooking Ellsworth Ave which was nice but I was freezing in front of that window Service was great Our waiter was very helpful and attentive but not overly so Food was good Best greek salad ever french fries and onion rings frozen and fried my falafel was almost burnt would have been delicious if taken out of the frier 3 minutes earlier and JB s Italian hoagie got his seal of approval The menu and attitude of the place is witty and fun we ll be back for sure 
giFEIKOSmx77vtFagE7w4w CMU great wings and other bar food good beer specials Really cramped at night Went downhill once Danielle stopped bouncing 
gJpjbxt3ll-YScZAuHpiCw CMU I used to frequent this establishment all the time before loud obnoxious college students began to annoy me that is The beer selection is great and almost everything i ve eaten has been good But be warned that most things that go into that woodfire oven tend to come out burnt Keeping that in mind I usually got the veghead sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries The sammie is served on a very thick bun I like bread so it didn t really bother me If you re watching your carbs you can get it downsized to a wrap instead It s almost impossible to get in after dinner hours because of the half off deals you ll have about an hour wait any evening of the week outside in the cold The food is good but it s not THAT good Ps sorry for hating on the youngsters I have embraced the fact that im just getting too old 
gMUyqErq7HrkQlUy0y2DeQ CMU Their burgers are quite good and ridiculously large One thing s certain you won t be going away hungry Also be sure to check out the 10 wine list you can t beat the price Overall Union Grill has good food is reasonably priced and is very close to CMU It s definitely a bit pricier than the other offerings on Craig Street but there s a reason why 
Gq1Cr_9t3DWCm-NNTZRFAA CMU I ordered delivery a few months ago Their sandwich and fries were good but the pizza was COMPLETELY BURNT TO THE PINT WHERE IT WAS INEDIBLE 
Gqgtj_JDnw8cyFCgPIEx-Q CMU What a hole in the wall But who cares The food is delicious We started off with house salads The dressing was awesome but I handed my olives over to T who gladly accepted For my meal I had the chicken parm The plate was the size of my body Not my head my body Delicious Covered in gooey cheese and piping hot rich red sauce Yum The pasta was less impressive and the reason for the missing star above Bland bland bland Just needed to add a little salt to the cooking water and all would have been well But no matter I concentrated on the chicken and left stuffed I would definitely go back to try other offerings The sandwiches were obscenely large but looked awesome 
GtY4ZgIWW3bgk1DWGkxjQQ CMU The 509 Cafe no longer serves lunch or breakfast 
GuIYYetHpU3eMGNvvuoPfA CMU Went for lunch after reading good reviews I ordered a fish taco which was supposed to be good according to what i had read on yelp and urban Our food came out after about 30 min Apparently when they say fried fish with avocado they meant a whole fillet of oily battered not crisp fish with a whole avocado sliced into thick strips and crammed into a 12 inch tortilla shell on a bed of fries It was absolutely disgusting The price per the amount of food was absurd which begged me to assume the quality of the ingredients must be low I m talking about two to three meals worth of food Best part of the meal though was after we finished eating we find ourselves unable to find our server We had seen her step outside a few minutes prior and we just assumed she had come back or would come back so we wait Ten fifteen twenty minutes Finally we just assumed we would never see her again and we went to the bar and asked the bartender to access our check We paid and left never to return 
gUPC5nnebJyf4fJyrjdx7g CMU Wow what a nice little spot on Ellsworth in Shadyside I drove down Ellsworth with the intent of stopping at one of the establishments in the cluster of restaurants bars around Harris Grill And the thing that caught my eye about Harris was the romantic patio set up they have which is unbelievablely awesome The whole entire patio area they have outside is definitely one of the best in the city I sat down with my date on the patio which is perfectly lit up for a night spent eating outside ordered some whiskey drink while she ordered a glass of wine and we ordered the goat cheese appetizer Harris has a healthy selection of cocktails beer and wine just like Shiloh does which is perfectly alright by me The Goat cheese appetizer is served cold with warm pieces of pita The actual cheese was very rich and was good to pick at I don t see how only two people could finish it we couldn t It s just very filling For my entree I went with the Jamaican chicken tacos and they were absolutely perfect The spicy chicken was cooled off nicely by a cold cilantro sauce that was drizzled over each taco Mois Bien The only reason I m not giving Harris 5 stars is because all of our food was brought out at the same time GODDDD Come on server That s why there are appetizers entrees and desserts You wouldn t bring someone s dessert out with their meal so why bring out their appetizer with their entree especially on a date 
Gyn2wqAR6Dt499Oss0rf0Q CMU Flavor explosion I love the food here there is nothing on the menu that isn t completely delicious Food of this quality is really the exception rather than the rule in an area so close to a big school as I ve learned But the service has always been slow when I ve visited and the place is always loud even when you re in for lunch and the place is almost deserted though if you re in it to really enjoy the food that s when you want to go 
h-D09UeLExUYkbHky9p2TA CMU Great selection of beers to begin with The wings sweet potato fries are awesome We had to order extra after we finished our main entrees The hog heaven pull pork sandwich is really good too Only complain i had was the chipotle polka pierogies came soaked in grease The place is a little loud but the atmosphere is fun Typical college crowd Best of all most of the items on the food menu are half off after 11 pm 
h-Kit-ljD4hLsO9Z90dqSg CMU This was the biggest and busiest of the bars as guided by my Pittsburgian guardian angel Derek he really was angelic and seemed to be the best people watching as well Very nice porch out back a bit crowded but with many of the right people almost felt like a little slice of Chicago but with nicer people that would talk to you even though they are twink lie Seemed like the place to be on a Friday too bad the drink were slightly weak but they kept flowing 
h6fhGTPcfTR2K5MZZRF2GQ CMU The ciabatta chicken sandwich was good but slightly unexpectedly spicy I probably just didn t read the description carefully enough It s worth noting that it has mushrooms so if you don t like those you might want to ask for them to be removed It s slightly pricy for a college town but not overly so 10 for the chicken ciabatta sandwich The mashed potatoes and gravy were decent but nothing all that special Overall for a college town area it s a rather good restaurant 
H8h15aWsiGre04puO41cBA CMU I made my way out to the 509 last weekend and was pleasantly surprised Restaurants in this area typically follow a more traditional meat and potatoes trend but The 509 offered up lots of variety in a small menu Even better the presentation was beautiful I tried one of their salads and wrote up the experience in my blog http www foodburgh com 2009 11 509 cafe I also heard back from an employee that they can substitute black bean burger for any meat based item on the menu Very vegetarian friendly 
hAlDQLhqflYtdEbW1b2ATw CMU I have been there once and I love it a lot The staff are very nice to me and every one Please try it if you get a change 
hapY7wgPy7VFPOFz4i16UA CMU I thought it was pretty good 8 subs that come with chips and it s a decent size There aren t lots of extras with each sandwich they just sort of what they are But it s good I haven t figured out the area too well yet so my sandwich tree is three pronged with Primanti s Market District and Pittsburgh Deli Co If distances were equal Pittsburgh Deli would probably be 3 on the list but I think it s a reasonable option 
hGxyLDL7c0l-H0bKkiqJUw CMU With so many reviews for this place already I ll stick to my typical list of pros and cons as an addendum to the important things other people have written TO THE LIST PROS Nice atmosphere Dark wood good lighting bistro tables outside weather permitting and front of the building completely open when it is nice outside This place has a good vibe kind of masculine but somehow cozy BEER Decent beer selection full bar nice place to go after work and relax Portions Expect a lot of food for your money Even the soda cups are mega sized Service Friendly professional well groomed Cons Rules They have a rule that your whole party must be with you when you are seated I ve seen them enforce it and let me tell you who is happy with that situation when it is all said and done no one because it is kind of a nasty rule It also seems they have stopped enforcing this rule because it makes customers cranky For you vegetarians there s little to eat potato and cheese pierogies salad fried thingies The waffle fries are good though Good to know It is great for lunch but the turn around isn t quite quick enough if you are on a 30 min lunch break The restaurant is a decent size but a group of 8 is probably on the high side of what they can accommodate for one party 
hJoSMo23wyIA3x5CZP7TFA CMU What has two thumbs and goes to a sandwich place for its pickles This guy I used to love coming here and rockin the pickle bar while waiting on my sandwich it seemed like such a novelty Anyway it s a good place I like that you can grab beer here too The upstairs is fun sometimes Sandwiches are yummy though a bit overpriced I think the selection is awesome and the ingredients are solid 
HjZoP5sD-HoM2D1g5qs7YQ CMU Their wings are not bad on the heat but sometime light on flavor The prices are pretty decent and the serving stuff was very nice My favorite part about the place is all of the fun stuff cluttering the walls 
hKvX0b8Oaelslg89cy718Q CMU I don t really have a good review for this place It s not that the place isn t good it s just that I don t have an accurate experience to recount I went for bacon night This is on Tuesdays I saw an outside patio on my way in On a nice day that area seems nice But the happy hour was good And once the bacon started it kept flowing So by far this was the best part Oh so while I would have usually given this place 3 stars for simply existing and providing me free bacon I knocked it down due to the really inept barstaff I spent way too long at the bar before being acknowledged to order a drink Yeesh Too bad I wasn t as cute as one of those girls at the end of the bar 
HmWe2BuIllx-ozi_MU7N4w CMU This place seriously hit the spot tonight I have had a variety of things and prior to tonight would have given this a 3 out of 5 stars The only things I ve had that I ve not liked were the frozen cosmo and the turkey burger Everything else I ve had burgers sliders french toast brunch plate both buffalo and spinach dips eggplant lasagna hummus I d recommend it all Tonight I got the white chicken chili cuz I was feeling a bit chilly myself and the calamari appetizer to share with NOBODY Ok my husband had a few bites but after I tasted the first piece I moved it back over to my side of the table I realize that they probably just drizzled it with sweet and sour sauce but it was fried to perfection then sweet and sour and just ohsogood Simple but perfect The chili was very good as well My husband had the Delmonico sandwich and mac n cheese side which he was quite pleased with as well I had a bite of the mac n cheese Very tasty And Tuesday is bacon night What more could you want in a bar 
hPQEN6taFIDi9Foo1NOY4w CMU PHI bar is a classic for CMU students who want to grab a pitcher or four or five after class the food is so so i don t think i would ever get it unless i was already drinking there Sometimes i swear that when you order pizza what you get is grease with a side of pizza Still can be tasty if you don t think about it friday drink specials make this place crazy cheap recent experiments also confirm that PHI can also be a highly effective study location as i can tolerate reading over lecture notes much more with beer and pizza 
HX_2sHBXDn0QkLw7xgF6Hg CMU This is one of my favorite parts about flying into PIT and driving to see my family We d always pull over and pick up a ginormous bucket o wings I do love me some wings And yeah I m pretty sure I ve had better wings but there s something to be said for the old gas pump by the drive thru the 30 or so different grades of spicy and the waiver release I can still smell you 
Hy_WtB3WeQXFhXKnmXOYKQ CMU Best veal Parm going 
HzFURzzYGNLRnpBUTBui7g CMU Friendly service but the food leaves a lot to be desired I have been there 3 or 4 times but only because of convenience Last time I ordered a pastrami sandwich and the pastrami was awful Tomato soup was literally marinara sauce For 8 10 you expect a high quality sandwich and it just doesn t cut it Bottled Beer selection is pretty good but only about 5 beers on tap I don t think I ll be going back 
hZQInLxmUaZ_oWFjqEA3hQ CMU Although some others have listed Shady Grove as a bit mediocre I believe it is a pretty cool place Atmosphere There are lots of big screen tvs and usually plenty of seating if you don t go during happy hour or high noon you should be okay I ve eaten their with my folks during the day and the service has been quite fast I ve also eaten with a large group of friends during a hockey game which took a bit longer but still was expected with a large group The late night scene is enjoyable Lots of college and graduate students and a large batch of 25yr people There is an open bar and drinks are fairly large Shots are quite large coke and rums are good I am not sure if there is a special drink offered but I ve always enjoyed myself there at night no matter what I drink Staff The staff is pretty prompt It is quite a large place so sometimes if you are with a larger group you have to expect it to take a bit longer Sometimes I ve been a bit surprised at how fast the food has come out though so you never know Food I think that the food here is good I would put some of the dishes on the same level as Cappy s down the street but others are outstanding I ve had salads quesadillas burgers wings chicken finger platters etc They have a great selection so if you are wish a group of people who are in the mood for a wide variety of foods it is definitely the place to go 
I4ah5oezj4FmhudUjFZvAw CMU Most of the reviews are regarding slow service and crappy waitresses While things such as that must be mentioned I have to say Harris Grill is a favorite spot of mine It was the go to place for large groups and a small catch up with a friend The frozen cosmos with a shot of chambourd is AMAZING 4 bucks between 4 30 and 6 30 YUM 2 of those and you won t notice if the service is slow or not I think the food is great and I love the upstairs view and the patio out in front The one time I had a less than stellar meal my waitress removed it from the bill with no hassle I will always stay an advocate of Harris It is a happy place for me 
I8G5oGfGJcux1u6zAJG3_A CMU This place is amazing Every single time I come here I am never disappointed Not only do you get what you pay for plus more it is really good food The menu may seem like any other place with the items listed but they bring something special to the table every time The area is a little weird parking isn t ideal but with the service food I don t mind a bit 
I9LIYf615xTDHIQc3F-2BQ CMU Pretty awesome place very near CMU Amazing Waffle Fries plus they have a good selection of vegetarian stuff as well pastas burgers etc Really good ambiance a lot of non student patrons unlike everything else in the area They are supposed to have a pretty good bar as well which I haven t gotten around trying yet Relatively classy place for casual dining 5 stars 
IAB0HGfO2XGCyKKuHmjxAA CMU If you happen to be wandering the area around CMU and have a hankering for some traditional American fare the Union Grill is a decent choice One thing that you might like when you step inside is the warm interior with soft lights and dark wood paneled booths When the lights go down this place definitely kicks up in coziness points It may not be the ideal place for a date since it can get fairly crowded but for going with friends it s alright I had the 4 hour pot roast myself It s a fairly heart combination of your choice of a side I had the sweet potato it was pretty good steamed vegetables and some thick slices of a tender crumbly pot roast that definitely lives up to its name Everything I had was a bit on the buttery and rich side from the beef juices so if you re looking to eat light the pot roast may not be for you All told not a bad night at all The only knock I ll give it right now is on price which is a tad too expensive but not too much to be griping about I ll probably go again in the future because there are definitely other options on the menu that I d like to explore particularly their sandwiches 
iAGY2sLkqpttIY620sxCtQ CMU Food was just awesome and Scott our host waiter was the best ever never an empty drink and great personality We had the meatballs pizza and chicken Parm hoagies We just LOVED being there 
ib0BvoCkVMy3AH_CP8PzHg CMU It s pretty bad This location is the the G level basement of the beautiful Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh s campus There s not much to say otherwise so here goes the list PROS The only real food in the Cathedral other than the salad wrap type offerings from the cafe CONS Staff is terrible rude unprofessional and irritated by the notion of having to do their jobs Food is always sub par because its sitting under heat lamps or an undefined amount of time Because its laid out like a cafeteria you get a tray get your chicken and get fries if you want it on your own from the heating unit there s not much else to talk about It could also just be my imagination but I have stopped getting food here altogether I think their chicken is fattier than other Chick Fil A s I always get the chicken nuggets and this is the only location where fat gristle is an issue 100 of the times ordered BLECH X 
IBLMFXOGmYP1-aiTtIMVmQ CMU I m undecided Some people live in this bar Get drunk and then leave b 
IKP_0LBvySXBVkCfZLFJKg CMU Meat and potatoes den like atmosphere The hearty food is reasonably priced and the fountain drinks are ginormous They have a 10 bottle wine program with a selection of fancy shmancy wines you would normally have pay an arm and a leg for Also note not located on walnut street actually at 413 S Craig St 
iLFZjwEnbYyTnp_8mDGzMg CMU Big Jim s was the first place I hit up on my cross country trip from Philly to L A so I was expecting delicious gut busting bad for you food in large quantities and that s what I got I ordered the lasagna Someone on Yelp said it was big as a head yeah they weren t kidding This lasagna was huge and boy was it good I give it a 4 out of 5 although I m not sure if they could do much more to improve it I think they should add another type of cheese to the top to make it a tad more flavorful but that s my take My husband got the spaghetti and meatballs The meatballs were not as big as I expected but their slightly spicy flavor was really awesome The pasta and garlic bread were just right too All right so the food has me around 5 stars but why the 4 Well I could handle being in a shady part of town and the overall dark dreary character of the place cause as Guy said on Triple D it s a Dive fine But at these type of places I expect really good service from friendly people Well we had 2 servers one was friendly but really difficult to get over to the table and the other was less likely to come around without being harassed and also seemed annoyed with everyone there For the out of towners deciding between Big Jim s and something like Primanti Bros go with Big Jim s seriously 
Inu-HYEd-0rV7Y2cEMc05Q CMU I think I just had the single best burger I have ever eaten Wow Had the steakburger with blue cheese blackened tomatoes and avacado The burger was gigantic and came with a huge portion of waffle fries Washed it down with a Green Flash IPA which turned out to be an excellent choice Fortunately I had just returned from a long run so was very hungry otherwise there would have been food to spare The she crap soup I ordered as well was superfluous but also delicious You can bet I ll be returning here next time I m in Pittsburgh 
isWyQdF0NL2yKX22AqtYQg CMU Awesome thin crust pizza Marguerita is my fav also try the shrimp tacos Good beers too Some of the servers are a little Tri Delt for my taste one of the regular servers in particular has attitude to the max but most are friendly Also really good salads I never say that 
IU4sxGZzXzA22N3QuyhOgQ CMU Fuel and Fuddle has great food and half off after midnight is awesome The service is usually good and attentive and it is great for taking groups They are very accommodating 
IW-df3K4HzboDa3y8PP69Q CMU One of my absolute favorites in Shadyside Their flying garbanzo is so hearty and filling that even my meat loving boyfriend didn t miss out on the no meatness Flavorful hummus roasted mushrooms and roasted red peppers on challah my favorite sandwich bread I also heart their barrel of pickles that are complimentary man they are DELICIOUS I LOVE that you can get a half or a full sandwich many a day I ve had to mix a flying garbanzo with the its a bird thing After 10 years it s great to see that their menu is mostly the same The veggie chili has changed for the worse over the years which is sad it used to be the most amazing I had ever had now it s very chipotle cumin just overboard and canned looking They also serve beers so it s perfect to just hang out there and have a deliciously large sandwich while watching some sports and sipping on a beer 
J4fwt0GxSnPiDzTvDOD_qQ CMU Don t understand the hype as this place serves slightly above average bar food in a hipsterish semi romantic atmosphere I cannot comment on the bar and or alcoholic beverages as I did not imbibe on my recent visit However my party and I sampled a good cross section of their menu We arrived on a busy Saturday night but were seated within 20 minutes Not bad Our table however was questionable They essentially took a big corner booth and split it in half so that 2 parties of four could be accommodated sitting directly across from each other It was kind of weird obligatorily staring at the couple across from me but I digress Some of my fellow diners started off with the Vegetarian Chili I sampled some and it was well spiced and hearty I didn t even miss the meat We also started off with the Spinach Dip The dip itself was fine though I ve never really eaten anywhere that could screw up spinach dip The entrees then arrived My companion decided to have their signature Mac and Cheese The noodles were a perfect al dente which is fairly refreshing in a sea of mushy mac and cheese The cheese itself had a sharp bite which made for an interesting flavor It became difficult to eat after a few bites however as the dish was missing a textural contrast It would ve benefited from some breadcrumbs baked on top I decided to sample their bacon cheeseburger which the establishment is apparently pretty proud of It was cooked to a true medium rare which is a rare pun not intended find in this city Also the bacon was heavenly an ideal combination of lean and fat They take their bacon seriously here and it was easily the most interesting part of the burger The pros of the burger end there however It was besides the bacon pretty plain The accompaniments lettuce tomato onion pickles ketchup mustard were absolutely boring The patty itself while well cooked and of a good quality was unfortunately underseasoned The burger could ve benefited from something that gave it some pizzaz such as a signature sauce some spices cooked into the meat or even some more salt I opted for onion rings as a side to my burger Here they re battered which is a big plus They were large sweet and a little crispy although too greasy for my taste Maybe it was because it was a busy Saturday night that I was disappointed I was expecting some high class bar food at this spot The common theme of the meal was that although the dishes were decent and competently executed they all lacked something such as textural contrast that could ve elevated them to true greatness Definitely not worth the price 
JbwhYknCKJGRaEEJ_frdqA CMU I ve been to Harris Grill many times My favorite thing is their happy hour half off all drafts frozen cosmos and wings from 4 30 6 30 PM I m happiest if I just stop by for a couple of brews and wings The strawberry chipolte wings are great I just love the flavor of the sauce It s not too spicy but very good Aside from happy hour I ve had very mixed experiences with the food there Sometimes it s been good other times it s been overcooked and or bland I ve also had some fairly slow service there but nothing bad enough to stop me from going back It s definitely a place worth checking out you guys be sure to take a stop in the bathroom while you re there I hear they have a very interesting urinal but I tend to stick to bar food brews when I go 
JDmlhPQYgJsZCA80uZp-pw CMU I had heard of bacon night from a friend and ended up going to the Harris Grille with some out of towners hoping we could pull off a memorable bacon y Pittsburgh experience Though I m told others have had better luck our server was forgetful and many jokes were made to explain time and time again why no bacon had appeared I d say skip the bacon night Other wise the turkey burger I had was affordable and tasty with a salad on the side I had an organic Oatmeal ale that I would recommend The menu was humorous and others at my table were also pleased with their food It s a step up from standard bar food and not greasy which is a The interior was dark too dark for my tastes unless your on a date and after that mood Outside was nice they ran out of seating shortly after we arrived and several people stood around us but again maybe this was an effect of bacon night Enjoyable enough I would go back good chill spot for a group if you can wrangle seats 
JemkPddsqsORKOLsDh1Avw CMU Horrible service Just awful Five to go orders came in after us ordered and got there food before the Waitress even put our order in The place wasn t even busy We ended up leaving after waiting for over a half hour The place just serves sandwiches I mean really 
jFCIIuO98vurIyV5-e1piQ CMU I do love me some Harris Grill From the cool vibe to the witty extensive menu to the plethora of creative strong drinks it s a winner I came here for the first time on a first date with my now husband but that really hasn t influenced my positive review of the place Everything I mentioned above has taken care of that My favorites are the fish tacos though I preferred them more when they let you choose your side tater tots and were cheaper the goat in a boat and the frozen cosmos 3 during happy hour Yes it can be busy but most good places are 
jfOY-io3SDtjKLUXK0_0hg CMU I go to Harris most every week for happy hour which features excellent half price wings I like the Colombian Gum Numbers and beers The atmosphere is very classy and there s a nice patio to sit on when the weather s pleasant I never go outside of happy hour though because it s just too damn expensive 6 beers 6 for 6 wings Why do hipsters like overpaying for things I don t know but they must as this place is always packed to the gills with them 
jGTpMB54fcgZcWMKBfRlxw CMU 1 2 off food after 11 random eclectic bar ish food but all pretty good my favorite is the smashed potato live fire pie it is SOOOO good what good be bad about bacon cheddar mashed potatoes and ranch dressing sounds a little bit strange but what s not to like D also great sweet potato fries and bourbon bbq wings their sandwiches are also good but usually i stuck with the smashed potato 
jjsBVpeUSEpTI7sMiM1LOw CMU This is one of the strangest restaurants ever The entrance is an almost hidden door at the corner of a block that leads you into a narrow not so clean staircase down into the basement You might mistaken buying lunch for buying some other questionable things but rest assure you re going the right way At the bottom of the stairs you ll see a door that only opens if you re still standing on the stairs because otherwise it will hit you Okay now you re in the restaurant When you first walk in you ll find a row of refrigerators with beverages like you would at a gas station convenient store The difference is that the whole row is filled with beer all kinds of beer You can get 40s 6 packs of domestic imports hard lemonades etc After describing all that the weirdest part is this is a fast food Korean restaurant You can get bulgogi kalbi duk in soup kim chi etc Weird right The food is decent and it s a great lunch spot in the heart of Oakland If you haven t been here just the experience is worth the trip 
JkY9GiloASkqEmViy51MVA CMU Nice Spacious outdoor patio in the front but it tends to fill up fast That s ok though because the inside is comfortable as well and has two floors the second of which contains a lounge area with couches Interesting beer selection all pretty high quality in my humble opinion Our waitress kicked butt and was friendly enough to chat with us for a few minutes each time she came by The burger I ordered was about two inches thick and very tasty Our shared pierogies and hummus with pita vanished within minutes 
jlF0LHAlpAq3WpPWWOujyw CMU I was going to write a review for the West Mifflin location but I m a city gal First and foremost ATOMIC WINGS You can t find wings hotter than this I remember one of my first experiences eating here I went for the hottest possible sauce and suffered through them enjoying every minute of it Sure I was delirious afterwards and you might be thinking of course a girl wouldn t be able to handle the potency I had a guy friend of mine try the challenge as well and I can tell you it s no picnic for anyone Which is AWESOME Hands down this is my favorite wing place of all time The Arizona Ranch is another nice flavor a little spicy but not too mild either The wings from what I remember have a good bit of meat to them as well The oakland location is a bit too in and out for my style but if you re craving wings beer and a place to kick back with friends and watch the game it s an O K atmosphere especially for the college students 
Jmj2XpA673QLKWwI9sqzVg CMU being a huge fan of spicy food and chicken wings i figured when i came out here i knew i had to try the Atomic Wing Challenge i saw this place on man vs food too which is just eating six of their atomic wings And wow i barley made it to the last wing It was so hot i couldnt think straight Warning DO NOT WIPE YOUR HANDS AROUND OR NEAR YOUR FACE WHILE EATING THESE WINGS It can be bad and burn your eyes And have some dairy next to you like a big glass of milk or something overall a fun experiance i was proud to represent california and orange county I am glad to be on the wall of flame and i got my sticker Would i try this challenge again ehhh tuff to say right now 
jsddu1OjxEvLUTf4pxioQA CMU Another restaurant on my list of Yeah it was good I guess places in Pittsburgh They make a really big deal on their menu about their huge portions and prices that haven t changed in many years despite them having to pay more for food I kind of felt like they were pandering for my sympathies and maybe I would say No Charge me more Union Grill I ordered a 4 pint of Yuengling which seemed high to me Since their menu said they have really big portions I ordered the 11 chicken pot pie which didn t come with anything else It was bland the potatoes and carrots were a little too al dente and I easily finished the portion Granted I was full but with a disclaimer of big portions I was hoping to have some to take home for dinner So it wasn t insanely good wasn t really bad I will go again to try out the burgers 
jvzw2I44_w0B6-F4zN8kCw CMU The fact that this place has a bacon night has impressed me for years I would receive fat smudged pages of letters written at this bar the samples of Dogfish head dripped onto dog eared corners for me to scratch sniff and lick at my discretion The men s room alone is a reflection I would leave unchanged in my description of this place The orange yellow urinal and the sink are shaped in the Rolling Stone s mouth logo Next time I visit Pittsburgh I will do brunch there with friends 
jX94r1VJTjsaGq0agfOwjQ CMU This is a pretty decent place for bar food They have a nice chicken breast sandwich and oversize nachos I have found after eating many a lunch here while I was working nearby that the quality of the food is a bit inconsistent The fries are decent and you can ask for a garlic aioli for them My wife would probably give them an additional star because she really like the sweet potato fries One good thing about this place is that it is great for a mixed group with lots of food idiosyncracies There are a decent number of veggie options e g a mushroom sandwich 
jyCpiHMhAUGLkmX-KvIk3A CMU What is a fuddle Nobody knows I hate the name of this place It sounds sooooo dumb They should re name it something less dumb sounding I used to call it That loud place because I couldn t remember what it s called and it s really really loud inside Aside from that stuff though the experience here is pretty good The food quality s pretty decent the service is usually quick A friend of mine swears by the nachos enough so that he generally won t order them from anywhere else If you don t mind loud and if you re in Oakland you better get used to it Fuel and Fuddle is just fine Except the name The name s really stupid 
j_bFbNsm2G_WhQLJdbK75Q CMU Ah Union Grill My favorite underrated restaurant around CMU You ve been my go to restaurant for whenever I feel this inexplicable gaping void that just needs to be satisfied There are oh so many reasons to love you 1 10 wine list 2 Burger medium rare with Stilton blue cheese grilled onions tomato lettuce avocado bacon and waffle fries on a beautiful hearty golden bun 3 Good salads for when I feel guilty about my lack of vegetable intake 4 Gigantic portions I could go on and on Alas I have to admit that I haven t been the most faithful in our 4 year relationship Yes there s another restaurant I ve been frequenting A younger one with well more sparkle But The Porch simply isn t the same Although it may have some new shiny dishes with more bells and whistles I still feel so comfortable with you You ll always hold a special place in my stomach 
K11dEzH4aXtnkR20DoxrIw CMU This place is going downhill fast I went for the infamous bacon night this past Tuesday and wow it sucked First off our waitress just wasn t good She forgot to put our order for a basket of bacon in and we had to ask for it thirty five mins later Bacon doesn t take that long to cook Then we had to ask for ranch with our wings which we d already requested but she d brought us bleu cheese instead Oh AND they were out of bacon wings On bacon night WTF Anyways we also had to request sour cream for the pierogies which is normally brought out with them plates b c we were sharing several appetizers and ketchup Why ketchup Let me tell you We d ordered the sliders as well and it was the saddest display of baby burgers I ve ever seen They were brought out on one of the same small plates that we had for sharing our apps like the size of a saucer that you d put a tea cup on And there were only TWO of them Two For six bucks I ll go get six non mini burgers at freaking mcdonalds And to top it off they were dry as the sahara and served with NOTHING I got the sliders at Harris about six months ago and there were four sliders to an order and they were served on a fanciful long plate with a selection of condiments you know ketchup tomato onion mustard etc Normal things that people put on burgers every day So that was really disappointing But it wasn t over The bacon baskets arrived The simple fact that they serve it in a basket seems to imply that there will be a pretty decent amount of bacon in there right Nope There were literally exactly four sad little pieces The big basket only made em look all the sadder And they d somehow managed to burn half of each slice black while the other half was rubbery and undercooked Yuck Overall I would never go back again if it wasn t for the fact that I have a gift certificate The only things Harris has going for it right now are its patios cleverly written menu and nice location on Ellsworth ave Oh and a lot of condescending d bags if you re into that kinda thing 
K6l2_NuktiyXtx-MWtYh3w CMU So on these hot summer days when I m just too lazy and uncomfortable to walk the extra block from campus to Craig St I stop at PHI for lunch I m always a bit apprehensive because it s one of the few bars in Pgh that meets the threshold for allowing smoking so the place is always a bit smoky But You can t argue with what I call comfort bar food The pizzas are greasy yeh but they are tasty And there s nothing better than PHI s steak sandwich and fries The fries especially are a wonderful guilty pleasure Can t speak about the beers because I m not a beer guy I ve come to avoid liquor there because the drinks never seem strong enough even straight whiskeys I m NOT accusing them of watering down the beverages however Even if you re NOT a regular the staff treats you well And it is what it is a dive bar But it s a good dive bar We ve had a few mixers there for students and they always go out of their way to make us feel welcome And if you re having lunch or drinks with a friend who smokes or if you smoke it s a great little oasis 
ka6YDnQMItS7oLrRZr5pcw CMU Apparently they have waffle fries again they took it off temporarily so they could increase its price on the menu I guess I have to give them a star back did you know Mad Mex has waffle fries too now The standards are pretty much their pizzas smashed potato buffalo chicken etc waffle fries and sweet potato fries after 11 PM when almost everything is half priced The wait is LONG as it gets ridiculously crowded as the masses of CMU and Pitt kids head down if you miss the 11 PM rush get ready to wait close to an hour Since waffle fries are pretty much the only reason to go to Fuel and Fuddle and there s no late night discount on them I d recommend going BEFORE 11 PM and just grab a drink with your fries and then head out to enjoy the rest of your night Their house beer is excellent and I believe they have a rotating tap If it happens to be Thursday Friday or Saturday night and you re still hungry you can head down to Sphinx Cafe where a guy grills up hot dogs 2 for 3 burgers 2 for 5 and pulled beef from 10 30 PM until 3 30 AM right outside 
kCfid1GgH-N1ziO7NhOBpA CMU If you can actually get a seat the Union Grill is quite the place We ve been coming here for years and although the menu is large and updated with specials I always come back to the same thing Pittsburgh chicken salad It s a huge salad with little piles of veggies all over it cucumbers tomatoes mushrooms It comes with grilled chicken crispy seasoned waffle fries and a hearty but soft breadstick The menu recommends the house garlic vinaigrette but I really prefer this salad with the honey mustard dressing Honey mustard and waffle fries were just meant to be together My husband got the steakburger this time around which was also quite good You can get this bunless or bun ed but make sure to order it with the cheese It s a creamy blend that makes all the difference in flavor We also got the hummus plate at our latest visit It like the salad has veggie piles of red peppers tomatoes cucumbers and onions as well as a big heap of feta cheese The hummus and pita were awesome but we ran out of pita early on and still had massive amounts of dippy stuff left The staff was super accommodating though and I would presume we could have gotten a refill on pita if we d asked They are currently promoting their 10 wine list yes that s 10 for a BOTTLE of wine not just a glass but we didn t get to check it out as we went in for lunch They have a nice happy hour special in the evenings I believe it s after 6 although I m not 100 sure and they don t have a website to verify Their drinks are quite good especially their rocks margaritas I think this is one of the reasons it gets so packed Oh one other small note that I love they have those gigantic glasses for your water or pop like the kind Pizza Hut always had in the 80s If you get a salty meal on a busy night this will keep you stocked if your waiter is running around The biggest issue here is getting a table On the weekends it fills up really quickly It s right between Pitt and CMU and it s a reasonably priced but nice restaurant where you can take your parents when they come to visit so there will be lines and waits quite frequently But if you time it well this is a great place to check out 
kCLrebW6Xqf751KRdbt3_A CMU It s a college bar but a good one A varied menu reasonable prices and good drink specials make Hemingway s a well rounded place to grab a bite or a pint Nothing will blow you away but it won t break the bank either I can t recommend the burger though that one s a clear miss 
Kdnw1UoBl3uKN5vDC0fumQ CMU Well Most of what I have to say has been said It s in an odd area While some people thought it was shady I really thought nothing of it It s tucked under a bridge overpass in a fairly residential area Doesn t look like much from the outside I went for lunch during a weekday I was the only one in the place The decor was pretty plain Big long bar some seating in there and then another room of seating as well My waitress was very very nice I didn t get her name The food is so cheap I ordered an order of the provolone sticks and a half of the chicken parm sandwich see photo Now I don t know whether it was because I was extremely hungry but that chicken parm was probably up there with the top 3 chicken parm sandwiches that I ve had in my life They toasted the hoagie which I think made a real difference God I m getting hungry thinking about it 
ke5FPZjbxmi8WNy8UN3xYw CMU Beer selection is pretty decent They have lots of Sex in the City wannabe martinis to go w the Sex in the City wannabe crowd But don t expect to run into some skinny b tch in Manolos It s more in that That s SOOO my life delusion way so common these days Food is okay but I find it s kind of hit or miss depending on what you re ordering and what night it is Nothing stellar One does not go here for the food rather the patio and the free bacon on Tuesdays Service is also possibly very good or very bad I actually don t even remotely hate this place It s a fun place to be 
KEUlOuzsr96EA3hQl9Wsaw CMU Go after 11pm for the half priced food and experience one of the best bar food menus in Pittsburgh The sweet potato fries are the best I ve ever had the pizzas are always good and the sandwiches are big When I go I mostly order off of the appetizer menu Never had a bad time here but if you aren t there at 11pm then expect a wait of up to 40 minutes I ve had some people be skeptical when I ve said it s worth the wait but I ve never had a complaint once the food came Also it isn t very expensive before the half off so I ve been here many times during the day you just feel kind of bad that you could be getting it for so much less 
kgWwiynng9_H5SzkeOUqdA CMU Price can t beat it we had a huge feast for 3 for less than 50 Service friendly but slow Italian wedding soup good but I hardly had any meatballs in my cup Pizza only thing good about it was the sauce Fries with gravy one of my favorite apps that we tried Jumbo wings the hot ones are made with red hot and butter which is always good Lots of meat on them too Chicken parmesan sandwich one of the best I ve had anywhere Very moist chicken Fish sandwich okay but not my favorite Overall I d give this place 3 stars but would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a cheap night out with decent food or great food if you order the chicken parm sandwich 
kLPIYK6NzYtv8PGjAtDWSg CMU With so many new semi pretentious restaurants opening in Pittsburgh it s nice that we finally discovered Big Jim s making it new to us It took me nearly six years of living in PIttsburgh but I may have finally found that go to no frills Italian restaurant that suits our laid back attitudes and selective palates I ve ran biked and driven past Big Jims over and over throughout the years but never even realized it was there It s so unassuming and dive y that it s easy to miss but stopping in is definitely worth your time We ve ordered takeout a few times and eaten in a few times already and it s never really disappointed The staff has always been really attentive and nice when dining in and takeout has always satisfied even when they gave me the wrong hoagie once it was delicious enough to forgive them Their chicken parm hoagies and dinner are both excellent and the dinner is big enough to eat family style Good luck finding food in those portions with that flavor for under 11 somewhere else The housemade Italian dressing is phenomenal and should seriously be bottled and sold We ve only tried the white pizza so far but it was delicious I ve had the Italian hoagie and cheese steak hoagie as well Both were good although I used their Italian dressing on the Italian hoagie which almost isn t fair since that stuff could make anything amazing If you re looking for a place to get a good hoagie pizza or simple Italian meal that s so reasonably priced you feel like you re ripping Big Jim off this is the place 
KLwRU4Ma8pq9GVdMhTj0Tw CMU Holy hot cocktailers batman And gangster rap any time after 8 pm And two dollar beers and half priced margaritas on Thursdays My service has always been prompt and friendly The food is indeed mediocre but beer is pretty hard to screw up It just has to be cold which it is God Bless I say 
kNGLFrlGRUtD0RF8ZKR43Q CMU Solid dive establishment Absolutely dirt cheap drinks A pitcher of Yuengling is 8 I think I ordered a whiskey sour and a grey goose on the rocks years ago and paid 5 I was baffled The bar has a funny smell but you get used to it and kind of like it after a few visits PHI is on my list of places to duck into on an afternoon on all my PIttsburgh visits Dollar drink Fridays which I assume they still have is always a mess Seriously a dollar for a long island iced tea in a plastic cup That is just a crime 
KOQUqLTgdW7VZYbyRNr73A CMU The half off for early lunch and at late night is really worth it but I m not sure I would come at other times I usually prefer the early lunch because the late night can get really crowded but sometimes that s half the fun The beer here and alcohol here in general is really really cheap There s always some kind of special for 1 or 2 It s also awesome that they have shots called Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus I ve tried a few of their pasta dishes and have always been unimpressed Their burgers and fries however are very delicious and at half off run at only 4 to fill you up My friend insists that yelp needs to have more subcategories for bars and classifies this as a college bar not a dive bar I guess it s true probably 98 of their customers are college students from around Pittsburgh and probably 80 of them are Pitt students 
KpHP0JVwM8RHJtuNLYClCQ CMU I first noticed this place on my run then I came across it in a Pittsburgh traveling guide and finally some 5 months later I had an opportunity to visit yesterday It s in a part of Greenfield called The Run tucked away from main roads and traffic Parking is super easy the neighborhood looks a little sketch but I ve ran here at night in the dark and it seems fine The restaurant was packed For this location I thought it would be pretty empty Lots of families relaxing and enjoying their huge dinners We were seated right away with people constantly checking up on us right away we got beer and menus I d say we had 3 waiters as all of them made sure everything was great The food is home style comfort food lots of hoagies sandwiches and pasta they have their menu online I ordered a 2 bill sandwich corned beef swiss cheese slaw and a fried egg It was HUGE and came with more coleslaw It sounds like they only have 4 beers on tap Highlight of my meal noticing Diners Drive Ins and Dives poster on a wall autographed I m not a huge fan of the show but still thought it pretty cool to eat at a place featured on Food Network s show 
KQuVe_JGS4SqYaJUISYEtg CMU Had salad one day for lunch while visiting Pittsburgh Decent enough and the vegetables were fresh but waaaayy too much dressing get it on the side If it s cold try the chili 
KtO7d7TjYmAreiWqZ3y_7A CMU I was so excited to go to this place We had a holiday in Pitt and I looked up great places to go this was one of them I was looking forward to doing the wing challenge and getting a nice beer Nope not here No alcohol The place felt like a cafeteria I was so disappointed The wings were ok nothing to write home about I hope other locations are better This place really turned me off 
ktPui9a5hSIHCD3LI-Qxgw CMU I love the patio here Always a nice crowd good music and friendly Pittsburgh locals hanging out It s my favorite of the gay bars in the area and they often have theme nights and friendly regulars around that love to chat up a friendly California girl Make this your stop to get acquainted with the local gay scene in Pittsburgh and know that the venue is friendly for gays and non gays in any case 
Kw6kVMogIaTSs1hyRtyjcw CMU Service isn t great but the food is above average and the atmosphere is welcoming I like the sweet potato tots Wednesday night is half off bottles of wine but it gets packed 
kXT-Vm7H3mZ_FD2ArGHqIA CMU I ll rate Cafe 509 somewhere between 3 1 2 and 4 stars My husband and I ventured down here on Sunday morning to check it out We hadn t been here since they took over from Elena s Everything about this place is modest It s a modest little place in a modest neighborhood with a modest menu In fact there are no real surprises on the menu at all The breakfast menu is pancakes french toast and variations on egg dishes Breakfast sandwiches are 3 99 and breakfast plates are 4 99 You can add coffee and a side for an additional 2 bucks So while the menu here is not as extensive as Eat n Park s what they have is pretty good I did try the breakfast BLT on Croissant which I admit was different and I do so loves me some BLT which was quite good My husband tried the french toast with 2 eggs which looked really good As others have mentioned the staff is friendly and the presentation is good They re open for breakfast lunch only Cafe 509 won t knock your socks off but it s a nice change from Eat n Park or Denny s and it s certainly worth a visit 
KZaako52122keTCeHHhzWg CMU I went here with a group for happy hour 5 pitchers are are awesome The jukebox was a little too loud after 6 pm but I imagine that s normal practice for most bars I am sure I ll be back since I m a CMU student and the beer is at the right price but it s nothing special 
L2VY6GQFVEn1RlcRvKp8OA CMU Stopped by for lunch Have driven by hundreds of times and ended up there because a friend said to met him at Dukes Station The bar and dining area were bright and very nice The waitress was very friendly and quick to seat us Service was very good My friend had the ribs and shared one with me it was cooked perfectly so it was ready to come of the bone and the sauce was a nice sweet and tangy combo Had a pork sandwich that was very good with a nice sauce that also was sweet and tangy but not to sweet French fries came with the sandwich and were very good Must have liked the fries because kept eating them ever after I though I had finished 
l3JNQqDEEfwvqeqoTxYGYA CMU Portions are ridiculous almost too big All the food was great though 
L6ADpM2rc6IwJuw8Dn3Ypw CMU Went dinner hunting after a matinee at the Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre and after a disappointing brunch that morning at Porch we decided to venture toward Craig Street Ali Baba was out since we d had Middle Eastern the day before and the Indian places were all closed or under renovation So after a long day we just decided to plop them at Union Grille Because of the early hour it was reasonably quiet and the cute little guy behind the bar seated us and within a few moments our waitress came to the table for drink orders My friend had experience with Union Grille and knew exactly what she wanted so I took a few minutes to scan the menu There wasn t a whole lot jumping out at me all being pretty basic American fare so I opted just to give their burger a try The menu listing had enough bells and whistles to make it seem like the most amazing thing since the first cow died and being a total burger whore why not The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and Ilene had the five hour pot roast It is a slow cooked pot roast with mashed potatoes and some kind of very red gravy and a side of the veggie of the day and this day brought fresh green beans The portion was enormous and a healthy dose of it was taken home Just be very careful how you hold it It s juicy It leaks But it was thoroughly enjoyable and enough for two meals My burger was large Before mine arrived I saw a burger being delivered at the far end of the restaurant and from across the room it looked ginormous and it was pretty darned big up close as well And it wasn t all just a big fluffy bun I also saw the beef from across the room The burger was cooked to order properly nicely brown on the outside and bloody pink on the inside the kind than runs down your arm upon biting into it The toppings were plentiful and the bun wasn t too big or too small Instead of the waffle fries I ordered the mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy and was a little disappointed There was something just odd about the texture and flavor of the mashed potatoes and the gravy seemed a little on the pre fab side Even though the waitress insisted that the potatoes were so real that the guys in the kitchen hated making them my tongue still got the feeling of chem spuds That kind of consistently slightly grainy texture and not so potato taste that usually comes in styro with KFC printed on the side but in this case came with a hint of garlic as a disguise They may say real but my tongue had serious doubts The burger was good but being that said burger whore it didn t come close to Winghart s or Burgatory in actual flavor It was large and filling but it just filled a void instead of hitting a spot The prices were the usual not extremely overpriced but not inexpensive The service was attentive and the atmosphere was ok As I ve said in a few other reviews seriously people those TVs DO come with other channels than just sports and news I wouldn t call this a go out of my way to eat there kind of spot but if in the area and all other choices are exhausted it ll do without being absolutely disappointing 
LAmrevRE6ZJrLwS6ZAiPRA CMU Best homo bar in Pitt The staff and clientele are friendly The food menu looked delish didn t try anything and the music was fun As a lesbian it seemed cauttivo was my only bar option and I really didn t like it So I m glad I found this little gem that has a good mix of guys and gals Perk didn t take long to get a drink 
LFj4D2wPqLtMw3MYC_fCQw CMU loved it started off with some sort of cucumber basil drink a little strong on the cucumber but pretty interesting then my guests and i shared pretzel bites which were delish i don t remember which burger i got to be honest but i do remember thinking it was very good the only strange thing about the place is the bathroom it s upstairs and near impossible to find i d go back for sure and would like to try several more dishes 
LHKhF2eTg1xXVMl7lVgL7Q CMU go here its PHI but you know you go too much when they stop carding you fyi 
LhyG9L0Lqla62PFfmQ1KpA CMU I love chicken wings and since seeing them on Man vs Food I ve made it a point to stop in at Quaker Steak and Lube whenever I m in a city that has one Not the best wings I ve ever had but definitely above average Quaker Steak s 20 sauce choices give them the biggest variety of any chicken wing place I ve ever been to and many of them are really good The Buckeye bbq is my favorite It has a good sweet bbq flavor to it but also packs a spicy punch The menu features some pretty unique sauce options such as Arizona Ranch Pineapple Rum Louisiana Lickers Tequila Lime BBQ and Dusted Chipotle BBQ The restaurant has a unique decor with a race car hanging from the ceiling gas pumps as handles for the doors and an overall gas station garage theme Good sports bar vibe if you re into that sort of thing 
lLiUQxwomp68-8fLQMjqfQ CMU In what may be typical Pittsburgh style there were fries in my buffalo salad right under the buffalo chicken I don t think the menu mentioned that Not that I mind too much Almost any American food you order around this area comes with them The service is pretty decent though your food may take a while to come out if you happen to go during the lunch hour rush There are a limited number of restaurants in the area after all The place also serves as a bar so the lighting is pretty dim inside unless you happen to be seated right by the full window wall I definitely don t mind coming here on occasion Everything is pretty standard and I usually know what to expect 
llmB8B9i-MX57voMnizo1g CMU I visited in January and thought this place was great Everyone was really friendly yeah drinks were poured with care but still i got buzzed I really really reccomend this place seemed like the least trashiest place and it was at the time Parking was a little rough but besides that i had a ball AND SMOKING ON A DECK big plus I hate smoking outside a door 
lMZOxGcxjzpKAwJ8DqY3Mg CMU Overcrowded on any given Thursday Friday Saturday night Or after Pitt basketball games when alums bum rush the closest bar to the Petersen Events center Let me emphasize how ridiculously overcrowded this place gets Even with great draft beer specials from 10pm 12pm everynight you d be lucky to get one every half hour if the bartender makes an effort to catch your desperately sober arm waving around Half off food is great here especially the pita w dip though the wings leave something to be desired Come on any off day and you can actually enjoy half off food with some cheap brew otherwise steer clear if you don t want your personal space invaded by every bro frat boy on Pitt s campus 
loQ9Pd0UN3tq-Zqj7nb5CQ CMU This is a great place for lunch but get there early or wait until the massive lunch crowd is gone everyone wants to eat here The food is always good at least I ve never been disappointed And the fresh warm sweet potato chips are worth it if you eat nothing else There are a few tables outside but the inside is cozy and inviting The service has always been good The only reason they lose a star is that sometimes you could faint from hunger driving around trying to find a place to park Like I said you are not the only one who wants to eat here and they all have their cars in the limited street spaces Walk to get here you are going to need the exercise after a big lunch 
LW31_v2kqRBJGQHayYAwWA CMU The official bar of CMU A fantastic disaster every time 
LwrgN4K513cBPgMKFkS-Lw CMU This is the bar that will not die nor should it with it s awesome outdoor space These guys have one of the best patio areas in the Burgh second of course to Mallorca s outside area The food is creatively named but otherwise not their dramatic strong suit Granted everything I ve had there is good pierogies chicken breasts named Nice Breasts Turkey Burgher but not overly spectacular The beer menu however is inspired These guys stock more unique beers like Omegang Hennepin and Victory Ales that are not usually on most bar menus in town And you have to give this bar credit for using a flame logo after having burnt down 3 times 
l_IOSmU-kvDxyQ-c2vuwKg CMU This great place does NOT take reservations 
m-hQ4o039z0WE6ssXnu0Vg CMU This place brings great memories to me Its a cute bar restaurant place and i guess its mostly filled with CMU kids and maybe Upitt They have a good list of beers and i am a great fan of their food Wait for it The world s best fried called the Waffle fries It s just soo tatsy and out of the world everything time i think of good food i still wonder if there is a place which makes waffle fries This is the place where i first ate waffle fries and i am going back for that pssst i even wanted to make a trip to Pittsburgh just to eat them And the last thing i wanted to do before leaving pittsburgh was any guesses Yes eat waffle fries They are great but not healthy apparently It s a great place to go hangout with a bunch of friends and relax Don t miss it Smriti 
M5aVqLQ_vkAiLjtXiuE4sA CMU Two Words Frozen Cosmos You need no other motivation to go to Harris although the food and service is good too 
mCfN7MIbg9FONW8S2xZKzw CMU This place isn t all that great for anything on the menu but there s nothing really wrong with it either If you re on Walnut street you ll probably wind up eating here at some point in your life 
MGUvbqEuM4e4TlpnRW8azw CMU NOTE they have just been shut down closed seized by the County Sherriffs office for non payment of the drink tax RIP PGH Cafe 
MgwJu5koSztEBrUIEsSJbw CMU F F is not a restaurant it s a way of life I went to college in Pittsburgh and there is NOTHING like F F s half price Late Night experience F F is not the only place that does the half price Late Night thing but it may as well be for me After 11 pm every night most of the menu is half price You do have to get there early 10 30 ish on Fri Sat Sun to put your name on the list but for students standing outside and chatting with your friends is part of the experience Edited to add Don t forget to tip on what your full bill would have been My faves include the sweet potato fries baked brie Smashed Potato pizza and turkey or buffalo burgers I ve heard they have amazing beers but I don t drink and I know they ve got some fantastic desserts my fave was the bread pudding which is gone now but the brownie and apple turnover dishes are delish too They also have a surprisingly good brunch and for the record the basement is much less loud than the upstairs Every time I go back to Pittsburgh I make sure F F is on the agenda Like I said it s not just a restaurant 
MHqPRwE1vkwaKlRS-gaJVA CMU After reading reviews saying that the burgers from Union Grille could dethrone Tessaro s as the best burger and my personal favorite in Pittsburgh I had to give it a try I had the Local Burger which is topped with tomato chili jam cheese lettuce and onion I requested the burger to be cooked medium and it was a bit over cooked This however in no way affected the juiciness or taste of the burger Is it better than Tessaro s No but it certainly was good My only beef about this restaurant is how in their menu they continually tell you how cheap everything is and how good of a deal you are getting i e Most places would charge 26 for a burger like this I personally didn t think that a burger and a Budweiser for 16 plus tip is that jaw dropping of a great deal Yes the food is good and the service was friendly and I will definitely come back but let me be the judge of how great of a value something is I don t need to be forced into believing it 
mJTpXipW8mPlT6GVjDfFQA CMU Not sure why this place is bashed so much for the service I really have no qualms Been there twice although never on a night with drink specials thank god I prefer going for lunch as their sandwiches and salads are awesome Not to mention some of the tastiest french fries around Reasonably priced tasty food with the caveat of going for lunch service only Not shabby 
mKleaoU0sUhS1kZ6150VbA CMU Was in Pittsburgh visiting for the weekend from Philly We were in Shadyside for the afternoon doing some shopping and we decided to eat here Sure enough I loved it We ordered the onion rings as an appetizer First the portions were generous but more importantly they were perfectly cooked and battered I hate when the onion falls out because of a lack of batter or sogginess due to a bad mix If you like sweet potatoes make sure you get the sweet potato tots as a side They went great with my pesto burger which was also great Overall it was worth the lunch time wait I will definitely go back when I am in Pittsburgh 
-2_xNAFEh8Qt2jsdvyC2hA CMU I m all for the benefit of the doubt so it was hard for me to give it 2 stars but as adorable as this restaurant is It really wasn t the best experience which could account for all the open seats on a Friday night The menu is a conglomerate of American and Japanese I tend to fear any amalgamated menus It usually means the restaurant isn t sure what it wants to be and therefore is not good at being anything at all I went with the American side of the menu Started with Coconut shrimp and dumplings Both seemed pre made not the worst taste just nothing special although my date enjoyed the dumplings For entrees it was the burger and Jambalaya The entrees were as the appetizers unexciting The Jambalaya was a large portion but pretty soupy and low on shrimp sausage and anything other than rice and liquid The burger laid quietly next to the fries hoping that who ever came in contact with it would be hungry enough to devour it I d love to say that since we were one of the only two tables that we received exceptional service I cannot Our server changed 3 times from seating and drinks to actual ordering Luckily we weren t in a hurry or super thirsty because after our food was dropped off We were left to our own devices we were there for an hour and to an angry waitress who would ve much rather lit candles than drop our check 
-44qH1H5LaW530X9QmIgeQ CMU A place where you can actually find something for everyone Creole American Mexican and even Japanese Another great find where most of the entrees are under 20 The soft spoken waiter excelled at his job Bread basket was great I finally found cornbread I like The creole chicken and shrimp with red pepper chipotle sauce was off the hook You get a lot of food enough for lunch the next day Comes with lump free mashed potatoes and delicious spinach that soaked up all of the garlic I will recommend this place to my friends up there and cannot wait to come back Dunno about the lounge though 
-bdpFpaPrOPnM-faFbWLrg CMU Do you like having the option to drink great beer or crappy beer sit next to a happy young couple or a pack of brahs know exactly when you re in the best table in the corner on the roof or worst table the one by the front door The Heights is downright schizophrenic Sometimes it s really nice sometimes it s a pain The food ranges from pretty tasty jerk chicken to standard fried whatever and of course they ve got what you re really looking for which is above average sports bar fare I love rooftop dining and drinking and this place has a very comfortable roof so I ll end up there pretty often if I m out with a group whose tastes I don t know that well 
-bOMpQ8jX4RUb-YDLNZRCg CMU Definitely a trip down college memory lane which oversized bar food and huge frozen drinks This is a nice place to casually hang out with a group of friends for a descent price Don t expect phenomenal food drinks but instead cheap prices and a super casual environment 
-cx3ilWSfur8c_w2wG3NKA CMU Happy hour drink specials only downstairs not on the roof Very tasty frozen drinks that due lead to high levels of intoxication Strangely enjoyed the Salisbury fries served with gravy Food is so so and it is a lot of barely legal or not yet legal college kids for the most part 
-DlE9nZKQi7XzWSEvkPWhw CMU Beautifuly decorated Don t come here if you re hungry though We waited about 45 minutes to get our food during Sunday brunch hour The burger was decent but nothing special Please hire some more staff 
-hKIQpdfoH7cvyDGB4w8rg CMU Such Good Breakfast My friend I went here a couple months ago for breakfast and it made our entire day She ordered blueberry pancakes and I ordered the homemade french toast with strawberries I don t really know what hers tasted like because I was too busy demolishing my delicious meal but she said it was fantastic And if it were on the same level as my french toast I have to believe her 
-kuaP6ZacsRU2KcrLOOHyA CMU The roof deck has been closed for a private party everytime I ve gone here so that s been kinda lame The cheap margaritas from a slushie dispensor is a nice change of pace Its definitely a Columbia hangout spot which is fun if you meet people without their heads up their asses Decent place to watch a game on the tv s A good bar to hit up while bar hopping the area 
-mDQ9LKnC5FoDqyWlfV3Tg CMU I love the food here but the delivery service sucks they were very rude which is unfortunate because I love the food 
-SSCt0V84ukRcIaoR9-t8Q CMU Found a speck of who knows what in my wine A bug A food particle from the person who last drank from that wine glass that the dish washer didn t properly clean Who knows Either way nasty Food is wholly mediocre to bad The only upside was the pleasant waitress 
-Ui8LDJvluiGssxTzzimjA CMU I don t know why JJ dining hall got such negative reviews Their food was more than edible Yes it s not as good as say Cornell dining hall but it gets us through just fine The brunch was pretty good There s a variety of waffles cereals salad bar fruits drinks etc I loved the chocolate soy milk But I guess it s too pricey for their quality Was it 14 without meal plans I will also complain about the to go sandwich box it was horribleeee Cheap cold sandwich with a bag of chips and cookies for 14 dollars Anyway overall it is an acceptable dining hall 
-_IxBhT-35dPc2MUTLJkMg CMU Those who know me well know that I when I have a crazy idea it must come to completion If I come up with something exiting I must do it or else I ll fixate all week Yes I am aware that I am bat shit crazy Let it be known to Yelpers that I have the healthy kidney 10K and the Brooklyn half coming up so every weekend I do one slower endurance run between 8 13 miles Usually I will do this run with Rita E She helps keep me motivated and we always have fun laughing and gabbing the whole way She is on vacation for 2 5 weeks so my motivation has dropped considerably Why run when you have nice herbal therapy at home and cold gluten free beer in the fridge So basically until Rita gets home i have to come up with my own motivation to run I calculated that running from my apartment in Brooklyn to Harlem would be about 11 miles and what better excuse to gorge myself on chicken and waffles If I am going to cheat on gluten I better go out hard So thus going back to the idea on fixation I had the idea the whole last week that I would run to Harlem to eat soul food I remembered seeing the Throwdown w Bobby Flay episode where he gets spanked in the chicken and waffles competition by a little place by the name of Melba s Melba s would be a 10 5 mile run away which was perfect for my long run I told Josh H that if he met me I would pay for his dinner He obliged and thus our visit I arrived in the restaurant a sweaty mess I profusely apologized for my disheveled appearance The woman at the bar was Melba herself and she told me not to worry at all I explained that I ran from Brooklyn and she promptly sat me down at the bar and poured me a much needed glass of water She was engaging and so sweet She even let me sit at a table while I waited for Josh A waiter promptly came over and told me that he heard I ran there We chatted about running for a while and he told me that Melba the owner was so impressed that they wanted to give me a free drink on the house Talk about awesome service I ordered a delicious Pinot Noir Josh came soon after and we both had fried chicken on the brain He got the combo plate and ordered mac and cheese and collards as his sides I went with the fried chicken and eggnog waffles with a side order of sauteed spinach to keep the semblance of healthy living We LOVED the food Like fuck me I want to marry you loved the food The eggnog waffle was one of the best things I have ever eaten and was well worth the gluten hangover This was one of the best ideas I have come up with in a while Service was prompt and so nice Josh and I wound up tipping 30 percent just because we felt so welcome Why not 5 stars Josh and I kept on waking up in the middle of the night to drink water Methinks that the brine they used on the chicken was so salty that we became dehydrated The food didn t taste salty but often times you find that extra sodium creeping up on you in the brine I don t mind extra Na Cl but not when I need to drink numerous cups of water in the middle of the night to maintain homeostasis Despite this we had an amazing dining experience and I would happily return 
0-oK0qelwpdwdb9-71PHow CMU Did the waffle propose to the chicken or vice versa Do you suppose the food priest said the following Chicken do you take waffle to be your plate partner until teeth do you part Both chicken and waffle agree Strawberry butter is exchanged I now pronounce you a delicious food pairing you may now be drenched in syrup This was my first ever chicken and waffles experience and it really gets about 3 4 stars Both chicken and waffle but both just seemed to have been a bit on the drier side That strawberry butter was something else tasting freshly of strawberries more so than butter I actually liked taking bites of just the waffle with that and syrup and bites of just the fried chicken and hot sauce sorry it s the Korean in me I went with a group of five on Saturday at about 12 40ish and we were happy to have no wait The waiter did get upset with us since we paid with 4 cards I was a server once it really is annoying I know this beat Bobby Flay in Throwdown but I m convinced there may be better chicken and waffle marriages elsewhere Got suggestions Send them 
03DJ2AO6G_KGdZZTxn4c0w CMU Got the lumberjack with scrambled eggs and blueberry pancakes Good food and big portions The burger I got via delivery was not so good though It can be really hard to find a table on the weekend because it gets quite Crowded The atmosphere is family friendly and a typical dinner like decur 
04_x9tDrQzYGjQ7MctajeA CMU Wow I love my soon to be neighborhood Everything about it has really impressed me thusfar and Melba s is no exception What a BEAUTIFUL restaurant As I was sitting there amongst fellow yelpers I took a moment to envision me and all my friends dining and laughing and enjoying good food and good company I had already eaten across the street but I browsed the dessert menu and went for my first slice of Red Velvet Cake It was indeed red It was certainly velvety And quite rich A little sweeter than what I desired but all the same quite enjoyable I was sitting next to Hugo O And when his Po Boy Sandwich came he offered me some fries I wasn t going to take one and then he gently insisted And Well THOSE ARE SOME GOOD FRIES Golden brown crispy seasoned to perfection with a little kick at the end Mmmm The wait staff was slow with getting our order and slow with bringing the check Guess they wanted us to stay a bit longer Southern hospitality I suppose Surprisingly reasonable for the atmosphere as far as prices are concerned And the background music was really good I can t wait to go back 
0BwXT1VPSrTIj9HlEN2tow CMU College students mean bad restaurants in general Especially at elite schools they have more money than taste and places that cater to them can do fine while serving garbage Case in point this place Obviously you shouldn t order a salad they re inedible but even the bar food staples here have a whole lot of fail What IS that stuff they serve with the wings mayonnaise cut with Elmers Glue and flavored with PAM Certainly you would not want to put it in your mouth 
0dva6w2in0pJMwg4zgpHWQ CMU Underaged college kids check Barely enough room to breath check A line to get in This isn t a club check Flimsy plastic cups check Cheap drinks check Loud top 40s music check What more can you ask from a college bar The view is pretty nice if you are one of the lucky ones that can get a spot next to the window 
0EsG6WWzp8y0uBDVXLj7Ow CMU I had a great brunch at Kitchenette yesterday and I highly recommend the place I had a smoked mozzarella and artichoke omelet with roasted red pepper pesto and a biscuit the dish comes with grits or other sides but that was more than enough food for me the only bad thing about this place is how hard it is to choose what you want to order i would definitely come back with a bigger appetite and dig into some of the delicious sounding dishes on the griddle menu like vanilla bean french toast or pumpkin pancakes even though it s way out of the way for me I m planning to go back soon 
0hkhOJFW7Q9O3hfK83Ollg CMU We used to live pretty close to this place and got delivery from here on several occasions I am partial to their mango avocado chicken salad but I hate that on seamless web the default is no dressing instead of the recommended dressing but that isn t their fault My husband enjoys the chicken fajitas and I agree that they are quite good but it is necessary to order an extra side of guacamole Really their prices just aren t that great and they never send utensils with delivery despite my requesting them EVERYTIME 
0ldrs4wUHWes_bYS-UkHRQ CMU Great place to go for comfort food It s a great brunch spot I love the macaroni and cheese and the key lime pie is Amazing 
0p5O2yZj_iyOlf1n5Oqg1w CMU The food is just really good from the macaroni and cheese to the burgers It s a bit overpriced so it loses a star by me but you leave satisfied And they deliver 
0rpxEEKoVL2h8RzKvW7CIg CMU The food is OK What makes it special in this neighborhood is that it is so cheap It s fun to sit on the roof or near the huge windows on a nice day Service is usually nice and fast A good place for lunch 
0S4mVrhhSfTsKRtBF_W_BQ CMU I love this little cozy place This place was highly recommended by the owners of the B B during our NYC trip back in Dec Yeah I m a bit slow at updating bash me bash me We were immediately seated to our table We noticed that everyone around us had a delish breakfast entree I had the Kitchenette Special 7 which includes free coffee until 11am My partner had the Farmhouse Breakfast Each breakfast dish was perfect Coffee was tasty Service was great If I lived in NYC The Kitchenette would be one of my fave places for breakfast and lunch Awww I m so missing NYC right now 
0sk7vYafr-JnYpPx9tvRnQ CMU I have a lot of experience going to Haakon s and I would recommend it for drinks dinner I get something different every time but at the bar I get the wings desert cookies or pumpkin pie catering or private parties I ve use both services to anyone Atmosphere sophisticated without the extra fee The Chef is the best cook and will work with you They stay pretty busy and Chef likes to be on the floor with his customers if he can He is a fun and warm guy even though at first he seems stressed because he likes everyone to be perfectly happy and to feel welcome I am there 3 times a week and use them for 90 of our parties I had a Thanksgiving party and Halloween Party for 75 people each On Halloween the party food was suppose to end at 11 00pm James the Chef kept the food coming out until brought out new appetizers till 11 15 unheard of anywhere in the city and without an extra charge For Thanksgiving we ended up having less people show up than expected and Chef made sure everyone got seconds which was amazing because the food is AWESOME Chef is also helping me with a fundraiser So it s a great place food atmosphere and people 
0U0_O_7JSbpf9nHrpHJT-g CMU I see that there is a lot of mix reviews on this place The only reason I didn t give this place a 5 star is because the restaurant was so packed that my friend and I had to sit at tall seats by a small counter The service was alright We went for brunch I had the sweet potato waffles which was pretty good and my friend had the baked vanilla bean brulee bread toast which was heavenly We also ordered the turkey sausage but it was very dry For a more thorough review check my blog http greenmilktea wordpress com 
0W88biFbzMfiyZ-SvS0v7g CMU My friends and I had tickets to see Tracy Morgan at the Apollo so we stopped here for a quick dinner before the show The dining room is small but is dimly lit I think it would be a nice place for an unpretentious date So my friends had seen Melbas on the Food Network show Bobby Flay s Throwdown where they competed to see who had the better chicken and waffles So we went there with great expectations and wanting to try the famous dish Well when I first received my plate I thought boy I m going to be hungry And as I slowly ate my waffle I thought this is pretty good but I didn t think the fried chicken was anything to write home about However the whole is greater than the sum of its parts When you combine the two and eat them in one bite now that is a good dish I don t know what it is about the crispy chicken skin maybe all the grease but it makes the waffle that much better Oh and by the way the dish was surprisingly filling 
0zpp5Aga__7c82UxDLOYHg CMU As other yelpers have said it s a good college bar with a decent beer selection and a wide array of mixed drinks I got the Caipirinha expecting it to be watered down but they definitely don t skimp on the alcohol which is a plus Waiters bartenders are nice enough Some minor complaints are that yet again as everyone has said it is small Be sure to go in there knowing that there are only two unisex bathrooms with gigantic lines to get in You ll be holding it in for the majority of the night but the cramped space helps with that 
11ljGnDIQtK87-vSfgHDdQ CMU Hmm with so many good brunch places in the area I hardly think KU is worthy of the hoards of people it attracts I ordered the woodstock pancakes and they were good but a bit dry My friend s dish some sort of egg item was also pretty average Sadly overpriced and overhyped 
145-CcHnrnAIZ7GV5f6iwg CMU I love this place and I actually think it s hands down the best soul food in Harlem That s not to say that some of the others aren t good but they are the only ones who get the spirit right and I think they just have the best food There are a lot of complaints about the wait and I ll be honest I m not a planner and I ve taken people here when I have the urge and have ended up having to wait longer than I would have liked even with a reservation But if you have ever eaten in New York you know the deal Furthermore the dining room is really small and I think this is one of the few times that the phrase intimate setting really does fit For two years I ve supported the restaurant because each time I ve gone I ve had fun It s one of the few places where you can go an eat and meet new people while enjoying a fine meal Perhaps the intimate setting plays a role in that If you re not a people person I wouldn t recommend going on Monday night or anytime someone is having a birthday the whole restaurant sings But this is what really makes this place standout At least for me it s more than just is the food good the service has got to work and here the service is peerless in Harlem Sure the wait may be long but once you take a seat you ll experience the finest service in Harlem Now the food I ve had lots of things on the menu but the chicken and waffles are great I don t like fruit at all but Melba has me craving for the strawberry butter with my waffles Now to be fair it s not a full waffle they are three small waffles which is fine by me because the bird is really the star of the show The crispy outer and juicy inner is exactly what fried chicken should taste like and when the syrup from the waffles manages to stick to the skin that s when the magic begins I love the macaroni and cheese but this is really a matter of taste I love how cheesy it is But those who don t like it I understand why I also love the catfish and the sauce they have on the side is delicious The potato salad and greens are also delicious I ve had the tilapia and it was ok and I m not really a fan of the spinach But those are my only two complaints The cocktails are also delicious If you want a full experience in Harlem this is the place to go I d say it offers the second best atmosphere yea that place with the Red awning may have them beat on atmosphere by a hair But I definitely prefer the food here 
18qDySrIWDDJ1I7N1Ak5Xw CMU holy shit omelettes that s all this is about omelettes they make them all day why would i ever order anything else oh wait they also make a brie green apple avocado sandwich that made me cream my pants ok fine holy shit omelettes and brie green apple avocado sandwiches good God almighty i knew i liked omelettes but i never knew the depth of that now DEEP love i also didn t think i liked fancy sounding sandwiches that was before i realized there is nothing fancy about putting brie apples and avocado on delicious homemade bread just something creative ingenious and freaking DELICIOUS 5 stars all day and all night they serve omelettes all day why would you ever get anything else unless its the aforementioned sandwich p s im sure the rest of their menu is astounding but i havent moved on from omelettes and brie green apple avocado sandwiches if you couldn t tell 
1b6JreBchfUoYP82Zko_YQ CMU The day after I posted my first review of Haakon s Hall I received a message from James the chef owner apologizing profusely for the bad service we had and asking for a second chance The following week I went back with most of the same group and he made sure the menu item I had asked about was available the service was friendly and attentive a different waitress and he even came out to personally check on us several times He also offered us an amuse bouche that I didn t have but I gave my portion to the Norwegian guest at our table and he and everyone who tasted it thought it was delicious Since my original review was not based on the food but only one individual I decided to update the review after they made sincere efforts to address their customer s complaints and provided a very positive experience on our second trip 
1e4eg3JeGEIn1Pnc6D2OIQ CMU Alright alright I only came here just because I saw it on Throwdown Okay I admit the only thing I ordered was the chicken and waffles Okay I m just another stupid tourist Fine I ll take it You know I must have been watching a different show or something because the Melbas I saw on TV and the Melbas I sat in were night and day The one on TV looked like it was just some hole in the wall place and this Melbas was fancy pancy very modern and chic Where did I mess this up Anyway the ambiance and decor were NOT what I expected but it was really nice either way We walked in just when the lunch service was at its end The lady who sat us down said she d have to ask Melba if she could take another order and Melba herself said no problem and she d love to have us AWESOME She even came out and was running around saying hello to everyone I love it when restaurant owners do that So of course we had the eggnog waffles with chicken of course Duh Yes it was delicious yes it was everything i expected It was a little fancier than I thought it would be I was hoping for a little more homestyle with big ugly waffles and the chicken right on top Nonetheless it was delicious My biggest peeve when getting fried chicken is soft skin and dry inside This was CRISPY outside and perfectly cooked and moist inside THANK YOU The only thing I didn t care for was the biscuit with the smuckers grape jelly I figure with the quality of her chicken and waffles that she would make her own grape jelly it s not hard for pete s sake oh well I m not sure if next time I visit Harlem I ll come back but it was a good experience 
1oYu2vJbVaU9X-qgBWOc2Q CMU If you re a college student you probably love this place If you re not a college student you probably won t love the atmosphere The rooftop bar is cool but it s usually packed with twenty year old dudes trying to get drinks Their happy hour and late happy hour are good deals though and their burritos are decent thought not as good as Chipotle s down the street 
1rhDmRCFH5Q0UzkXvcWgYw CMU I just can t say anything bad about this place I just can t It s a little crowded Sure the wait can be long up to 15 min But your 10 brunch just can t get any better Can t It s really really hearty My eggs were so soft filled with potatoes and cheese all gooey warm and tasty My orange juice was fresh My toast and jam were just damn Our waiter was so frakking nice Decor was like sunshine I have no clue what these peeps are talking about 
1RyRAQWDbuQvjw2Z7e3X_w CMU Title Me Belly Full of Cheese Grits The bottom line I departed w a BELLY FULL OF CHEESE GRITS That was bout the only thing that I enjoyed My bisuits were BLAH BURNT cooked too long bacon quality was no comment and the red potatoes did nothing for me either Also the tabletops made out of old doors covered w glass I think are quite unique but a bad choice if you can t thoroughly clean out the cracks crevices as the table I was seated at was full of crumbs EEK 2 stars for the overall meal 4 stars for the grits For me it was a disappointing 1st brefass in NYC And to think a staffperson at our hotel had recommended the place the day before our first day in town but we decided to go somewhere else I would have been pissed if this had been my first meal in town 
1tSRwdowSITOPHkJThkBvQ CMU My sister and brother in law live a short walk away from 107 West so we decided to hit it up for my sister s birthday dinner We ate dinner here on a Sunday evening and there was no wait time for our party of four We were seated by a ceiling to floor waterfall thing that had me totally entranced for the first few minutes Honestly I don t remember if the rest of the restaurant was well decorated mainly because I was so fascinated by the waterfall The menu was interesting In most places I d laugh at the menu and say there s no way it could ever work However this is New York City we re talking about An American Asian Mexican menu with a New Orleans twist works in New York City Sushi fajitas burgers and jambalaya on the same menu I had the blacken Mississippi catfish with roasted new potatoes THE BOMB I tell you It was SO good The roasted red pepper chipotle sauce was awesome We were all completely satisfied with our appetizer and entrees but the real highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the mocha mud pie I ve had some world class desserts in my days thanks to many trips to the legendary Harry Waugh Dessert Room in Tampa and I think that this dessert tops my list of best desserts ever Service wasn t quite on par with what would be expected of a restaurant of this caliber this is the only reason that I am not giving five stars After our table was cleared we waited at least twenty minutes until I finally had to request our check 107 West has great food and even better dessert I can t wait to go back for another delicious slice of mocha mud pie 
1U_8gqi8PEWr2kMvJalpSA CMU I ve loved Melba s ever since we moved to the neighborhood 4 years ago when it was the only decent restaurant in the area now it s practically restaurant row I attempt to get something different every time but usually end up with the mac and cheese with a side of collard greens really terrific and red cake for dessert With a Guiness and coffee after it is pure comfort food Everyone is always very nice but service can be spotty really depends on who you get as a server and the noise level can sometimes be almost deafening Still the amazing food keeps me coming back for more 
1wpT1cZ-OkVY-El85xuZpg CMU Seriously I loveeeee this place Like many I live in the upper upper west side aka Harlem and don t have a ton of great eateries nearby This place is so yummy so affordable roughly 10 12 dollars an entree and their bakery is so exceptional A good friend of mine is obsessed with the color pink so for her birthday Kitchenette Uptown made a red velvet cake and dyed the entire thing pink for us at no additional cost It was a salmony pink with neon green letters and soo retro and festive Also it was delicious and moist The price wasn t bad either for such quality Fed 25 30 people and was only 70 dollars Will be back VERY soon 
1XhKSgfNqRz7OMD99vJd5Q CMU Clueless wait staff specials confused We ordered a special a half lobster on capelini and decided on the salad as a side It came minus the pasta When asked why the confused waitperson claimed the salad was the substitute not so but we let it ride My dish shrimp and scallops was totally ill conceived they wrapped the skinny little shrimp around the scallops Do they know that scallops take longer than shrimp to cook I guess not The shrimp were overcooked and the scallops were mushy and undercooked all covered in a goppy breading that turned to an uncooked batter Never again 
2bxilYvWcbGunyY2IipM9A CMU Came up on a Sunday evening to have dinner and play trivia The food was solid but considering the price was a steal Had grilled chicken over mashed potatoes and a nice selection of sauteed vegatables I believe that was 10 95 Rolling Rocks were on special for 3 Our table ended up winning the trivia and took home a half magnum of wine I don t live in the area so it s a hall sorry but it s certainly worth checking out if you live in Morningside Heights 
2cuI_JvJijp4_02A7LRoow CMU Cute cozy with large portions of homestyle food my kind of place It was cold out so the chili lunch sounded like something that could warm me up but when the waiter also mentioned fresh strawberry sangria I had to order some too Chili of the day had a good balance of beans and meat Plus it was served with crusty delicious corn bread The strawberry sangria was so good that my friend and I decided to have a second one and it wasn t as good turned out the 2nd was a fresh batch and the 1st was the bottom of the barrel which meant it had more time to soak up the flavors The service was friendly but relaxed aka slow but no problem cuz I was just hanging out chatting Overall I enjoyed it but it was a bit pricey 
2E2C4DeQjay9QJcMBKoWmA CMU I swear by their meatloaf They have some pretty sinful desserts too If you live around the place its a cosy place to sit around with a book and your meatloaf and soak into the neighbourhood 
2eoYz-D5TAH5AsedtO_ipg CMU A new bar restaurant just opening where Radio Perfecto closed It adds a much needed food and drink destination to that stretch of Amsterdam Avenue The decor includes Norwegian flags and the menu includes some Norwegian fare including lingonberries I haven t seen the regular menu yet but the prices on the graduation menu looked very reasonable The new waiter was sincere and attentive sweetly handing me my glass of pinot grigio to drink before it gets cold 
2GUxT6W7DPdtZONAAVDOTQ CMU I literally live right around the corner from this place so this place is pretty much my default date spot The restaurant boasts southern comfort food for its cuisine but the food is more inventive than that name would suggest As a lineup I would certainly recommend the Soul Food Spring Rolls Short Ribs Mac Cheese and one of the vegetable sides none of which particularly stand out While all of the food is good there is better soul food to be had but for an overall experience and for the innovation in some of the dishes Melba s is one of the best As far as the ambiance goes the place is small but quaint and has a quasi church pew setup inside All of that makes for a very comfortable eating experience and I ve never had an issue with the service My only complaint would be the live music that is sometimes offered For my taste the restaurant is far too small to support live music unless your into struggling to keep food on your vibrating fork Overall avoid the live music and you re guaranteed to have a good time 
2H1LSiarKh2Tj3VWTsCPBA CMU Hungover and starving we headed over to Kitchenette for a sweet and savory brunch fix Clearly everyone had the same idea as there was a line snaking out the door Luckily there was seating at the counter so we opted to ditch the 15 minute wait time and get our grub on asap I ordered the herb and goat cheese omelet with potatoes and a biscuit I had a moment when I bit into my omelet Muy delicioso The red potatoes were perfectly seasoned however the biscuit left much to be desired The texture and weight was akin to a muffin It way too heavy and dry It was somewhat tasty with the strawberry butter spread but I felt like I was eating a giant cracker instead of a warm moist and fluffy buttermilk biscuit As part of my never ending quest to find a red velvet cupcake better than Zoe s I ordered one to go The cream cheese frosting was super delish however the cake was heavy and a tad bit dry Seems like baking isn t their strong point Regardless I had a pleasant experience overall 
2O0mx2TU3Msm2iFKfsewCA CMU Kitchenette is a solid brunch joint with portions that are just right filling Our group was seated with only a short wait The decor is breezy crisp and bright A very cool execution very suitable for a breakfast brunch joint It doesn t work too well for the dinners though and besides their dinner menu pales much in comparison to the brunch The pancakes are fresh having a perfect pancake fluffiness I can t recommend their turkey sausage fly with the pork sausage or bacon instead The price is a bit extra compared to the quantity quality of food provided but very comparable and reasonable for the area Kitchenette is easy to get to located near the Columbia University Morningside campus and a good brunch restaurant 
2p5Nuz4X9jol0A8OSBQRpw CMU Hello brunch Following a long night of celebratory imbibing we traveled to the Heights in search of nourishment and you got it hair of the dog For 9 95 on the weekends the Heights offers your choice of brunch entree plus a 3 mimosa glass of champagne Bloody Mary margarita OR draft beer Hmmm we re in NYC so I m thinking the price tag screams impending food failure I was wrong A mere 20 minutes later I was able to wholeheartedly vouch for the eggs Benedict with bacon Benedict is a back up on my last meal list so I ve tried many many versions But the Height s rendition ranked among the best My friends enjoyed their omelets chef salads breakfast burrito and of course cocktails The mimosa could have used a more liberal pour of bubbly but at 3 it s a steal Also the Heights serves 6 or 7 fantastic import drafts if beer is your preference Service is unapologetically woeful but they did let us linger for an extra hour and refilled our coffee water often Oh and don t sit at the table closest to the door during the winter as the steady stream of incoming patrons will require the pesky presence of your coat 
2pe9CAhGGINp1EwDrmfQ_A CMU This was my second visit to Haakon s Hall This time I brought 3 friends and we all enjoyed it The atmosphere is so friendly and comfortable I had made a reservation earlier in the week so we could get one of the round booths and that worked out great My friends had the salmon and thought it was perfectly prepared I had the paella and thought it was fresh and very tasty For dessert we had the norwegian ice cream sandwich and everyone loved it The house wine was especially delicious All in all a wonderful and reasonably priced evening Cannot wait to return 
2QxxHnDb6cp4V4FqDO3oxw CMU Probably my favorite brunch place in all of NYC and that s actually sayin something I lived across the street from here last year and I would go here about once a week It gets extremely crowded on the weekends and you usually have to cram into a small table and be awkwardly close to your neighbors I wouldn t come here with more than four people probably Everything is great here and I ve tried most of it eggs pancakes muffins french toast sooo good The place is extremely cute a great place for brunch date 
2ra_UIJgekoHaiOb8gYU9w CMU I have been here twice on a sunday afternoon for brunch the bartenders have a heavy pour and the food is plentiful and tasty It like a converted studio loft with super large windows and cool exposed brick Better not have any plans on being productive after 2 3 bloodys or a few ritas If you like lots of vegetation in ur bloodys you will like this place I had the mexican omelette with a side of home fries which were crispy just the way I like them the roof top is also super cool GO 
2T5HR6iJXw6Wkp1S-8YscA CMU Ooooh I had the Lumberjack breakfast and it was superb I m not even that fond pancakes but I loved these ones and the homemade sausage must have been made from unicorn meat because it was FANTASTICAL My gf s tomato artichoke pesto omelet was also tangy and delicious And the baked goods I haven t tasted them yet but they looked so good I had a quick fantasy of myself breaking in after hours and stuffing one after another into my face rubbing the frosting into my cheeks not that I d actually ever DO that heh heh They also apparently do kids birthdays where they can decorate their own cupcakes Oh to be a UWS elementary schoolkid in the 21st century 
2tLf_o_zIg0R67UAlnOEVQ CMU The service and atmosphere are great and I m always pleased with the food Try the turkey meatloaf you won t be sorry 
2_yxblzACR4GxFnbc3M-pw CMU My boyfriend went this afternoon for the first time I am Caribbean American and he is African American From the moment we stepped into the dining room we felt unwelcomed No one greeted us and the waitress was SLOW to arrive because she was too busy talking and rolling silverware When she did arrive she says order what do you want to order No smile or anything We knew to expect slow service but she was rude and cold as well Although there were only 12 people there service was absolutely terrible We came in before the Hispanic family european French family and interracial family We ordered before 2 of the three families but were served last Served 15 minutes after the last family to arrive which was almost an hour after we sat down While my boyfriend and I were wondering where our food was our waitress sat down with her back facing up and proceeded to eat her own meal After watching her eat for about 10 minutes we got up to leave and another waitress assured us our food was on its way We did NOT order complicated meals shrimp and chicken skewers So why were we ignored until the food arrived and served last There were only 2 of us compared to the non black families of three and four that were served with kindness before us 
36SnniybCL8RkbLq6MyPbg CMU Sort of in between a 3 and a 4 Will have to go back a few times and see what the deal is The food is pretty good The crepes themselves are better than Artopolis but they don t include as much nutella Service tends to be slow even when the place isn t busy 
3aANgexjgohzISoA2HLGXg CMU Dinner is solid but not fantastic The breadbasket is deceptively good looking but never as good or as fresh as you think it s gonna be Breakfast and brunch are in my opinion kind of awesome Their herb and goat cheese omelet is something I love love love They also have fun sweet breakfast dishes that feature little tweaks on traditional fare like pancakes and French toast I m a fan I also LOVE the strawberry lemonade Half a star off because the servers attention can be really hard to get I ve done the stare at the back of her head till she feels it and turns around thing a couple of times A quarter of a star off because their OJ is NOT fresh squeezed you d think a place with such good strawberry lemonade would make a point of doing fresh squeezed OJ and another quarter of a star off because their beverages are kind of overpriced There you go A very good 4 star brunch place Also their cakes are really good Be advised The wait can be long on Saturday and Sunday mornings but just expect that and you ll be fine 
3azkEBs1w-TSupl5zB9JRQ CMU Wish I could say 3 5 stars If you don t stray from basic omelets and burgers it s actually a good place Coffee is also good I ve only had the BEST service really sweet guys who are attentive without hovering which is hard b c the place usually is pretty empty Good place to bring family if they re white Midwesterners used to places like Applebee s they ll feel safe here 
3Msm6YF20VDdQn2e1ttndg CMU Decent food i had a spinach and cheese crepe but I can t wait to try more sweet crepes Glad to have more places in the neighborhood to grub down in Good for group the waiter even offered to split the bill for 4 of us Next crepe to try nutella and strawberries yummy 
3wHZFzdo6bp7jmS6wK2pGw CMU A for actual Africans eating there Service Slow as molasses Portions huge Food nothing to rave about 
3X95bPgP1KSqkkgjLcwtDw CMU If you ve ever eaten breakfast in SE Portland OR where I lived for 10 years you ll recognize this as a lesser version of the homey Portland cafe but more crowded lesser quality food and not as cute For this neighborhood though it s the BEST breakfast Its high prices are still less than a ticket to PDX so suck it up close your eyes and pretend that your server has good tattoos and plays with the Thermals or Modest Mouse 
44mi-5ZQ4KpdW2Rl4jTVtQ CMU Thus far the best Southern style food that I have had in NYC The short ribs were tasty and tender and the fried chicken is Umm Umm Good The only downside is that you have to go there at an unconventional day time to get a seat but it is well worth the wait 
47r38A7uNHuNipmTL7-9eA CMU Wonderful for a summer night It will be crowded but if you can finagle a table on the roof the margaritas are a sweet reward During the colder months it s still a fairly good place for brunch or dinner Late at night the Columbia kids flood it That can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your view 
4ipCXu_hnZJfTndnoNJ2BA CMU Good food but can be greasy at times Delivery can be a bit slow but always reliable in terms of when they get there Can t speak to the ambiance of the establishment but it is good for food moderately quickly when you can use it Eat too much though and you ll find yourself packing on the pounds Best dish is likely the herb grilled half chicken For those of us with ulcerative colitis not much love as most things are oily buttery and cheesy at the least the best stuff Definitely no good for a flare but if you are doing well and tempted to cheat a little the food here might be worth a try with the caveats stated above 
4m5ee3Hai9jmVeK6rmr2rg CMU Best place around Columbia university Decent food with good sized portions But the main attraction here is their frozen margaritas which come in an assortment of different flavors passion mango strawberry etc They re BIG drinks and worth it at regular price 8 and even more worth it late night and at happy hours when they re only 4 It took only two margaritas each for my friend and I to feel them Other than sitting eating here it has a cool rooftop that is busy at nights weekends 
4nbCQXjG8as3KXuHhtGXwg CMU Let me tell you something Mean Gene Usually my greed when to comes to food helps me when I go to a restaurant but when it comes to good comfort food it s a little harder to pack it away Apparently this is how the folks at Kitchenette Uptown get you to come back and it DEFINITELY works I had the pleasure on my first visit to partake of the French Toast with eggs and bacon for brunch and I was truly pleased The menu has plenty of choices for anybody and I will gladly review other meals as I get them the mac cheese BLT may be next on the list The only thing that was for lack of a better word bad about my first visit is the fact that our party was placed at a table that really was too small for us This was in no doubt due to this restaurant s popularity as many many people frequent this location However since the staff is very attentive and helpful and as I ve mentioned before the food is very good I m willing to take the good with the not quite good by circumstance P S Where are the half stars Yelp This place needs a 4 5 
4NXI78v4jusg0wTwfvXZoQ CMU Good for breakfast nice To Go pastries too 
4pxx9t0xOo8xkGEBGFxDqg CMU The plethora of polka dots and cute sy decorations cannot compensate for the less than mediocre quality for their food The turkey sausage tasted like soap the bacon was tough and dry and the grits were the worst watery and runny and bland Out of a box for sure Definitely not worth the price 
4Rf3DQEO7j1zJ05JCJbg0Q CMU Yummy Great for brunch I love this place and am dying to go back in the summer when they offer their frozen mint hot chocolate 
4wunavvDCxW97ylMS5B0DA CMU Oh Yea A friend of mine from work told me about Kitchenette and how it was his favorite restaurant so I knew I had to try it This place is located in the cut over on Amsterdam past Max Soho and Max Cafe The people were friendly and greeted us immediately upon walking in It was much more casual place where we seat our selves but i actually prefer the freedom of being able to sit where I like The waiter Jon was new and he admitted to not being too experienced when it came to the best thing on the menu This I appreciated because several time s I ve gotten people telling me to order things they have never tried themselves before Carol decided to order a Seaside Summerbliss and I decided to go with a Strawberry Lemonade Both drinks were really good and I even mixed some of the Summerbliss into the Strawberry Lemonade for a nice little kick Carol ordered the Ham Brie sandwich with a salad and I ordered the Kitchenette Specialty which is the Turkey Meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy The Turkey Meatloaf was really good and cooked just right I ate all of it and Carol even enjoyed it also All while we were enjoying our meal Jon was speaking with us about our favorite show Seinfeld and we were asking him trivia questions about where does jerry kramer and george live He was able to answer all the questions surprisingly even though he recently came here from Michigan so this was all cool and the conversation went great along with the meal For desert Carol ordered the Triple Chocolate Cake I was stuffed from the Turkey Meatloaf so I only ate about as much as a fork can grab All and All I thought Kitchenette was cool a nice place in the cut and seemed real simple but good No complaints here and I ll be visiting again for sure 
52LjNWy9BZaNPPlm2FRnFg CMU DISGUSTING I ate here once and that was enough First it is in a semi abandoned building But a friend of mine insisted that we try it First the place can do for a remodel but as an ethnic restaurant I tried not to let my western thinking effect things but clean would have been nice I should have left when I WENT TO THE BATHROOM AND THE WATER WAS NOT WORKING Plus it was nasty in there As someone mentioned the menu is sugesstive as many items aren t available so you need to talk to a waiter for a true idea of what you can order It took too long to get the food and I noticed that they were microwaving the plates on the side I really hope I didn t eat yesterdays food in that rat trap DON T GO 
5B_u_8sG8sCAEun6tMYNXw CMU Sorry Melba s I really wanted to like you but it was just kind of okay The service for our party of five including two small kids was gracious and welcoming the highlight of the experience The food was the let down The chicken and waffles were just okay Portion was rather small the fried chicken was dry and the whole eating experience was just plain To reference Malcolm Gladwell maybe for this day the kitchen experience was an outlier and more practice is warranted I ll give it another chance but still this was a bummer 
5CaUDMZIo98moAqATR6GAg CMU Melba s oh Melba s what a delicious place you are I meant to write this two weeks ago when my cousin from Boston came into town and we went to Melba s to have dinner I had the BBQ Turkey Meatloaf dinner and my cousin had the Fried Chicken dinner We had calamari for the appetizer and macaroni and cheese and greens for the sides along with red velvet cake for dessert The food was outstanding The service Not so much So I returned tonight with a good friend coworker for a second take I had the chicken wings and eggnog waffles and my friend had the fried chicken dinner with macaroni and cheese and greens Calamari again for the appetizer The calamari was light flaky and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside but not taffy chewy like calamari can get when prepared improperly There was a clear savory spice in the breading used yummy The chicken was pretty good with a decent meatiness and savory flavor The waffles were delicious They were a bit heavy but there was the definite hint of eggnog and the strawberry butter was a nice touch Real syrup rounds out the dish My friend s chicken macaroni and cheese and greens Delicious Oh and did I forget to mention that the macaroni is made with three cheeses And that the greens are cooked with smoked turkey necks among other spices I really like the healthy spin on soul food Another feature of the restaurant is the beautiful decor To be honest it s a bit tight in there with the seating but the decor and ambiance is wonderful Classy soulful is how I d categorize it There s also a full bar which serves what seems and sounds and looks like good drinks I don t so take that for what it s worth I give it four stars for two main reasons one I need consistent good service The service on my first trip was lackluster and the service tonight was on point Let s see how they do when I return hell yeah I m coming back Second if and when I upgrade this star I ll also upgrade my star rating for Amy Ruth s The food is similar enough the main difference is ambiance service and that Melba s costs a tad more than Amy Ruth s But if you re in Harlem definitely check out Melba s You might actually run into her she likes to mingle with the guests patrons when she can 
5CQUz0gbzTWUVLikjHBDLw CMU This is easily one of my favorite brunch spots on the UWS and the restaurant is super cute on top of having delicious food While you will definitely have to wait if you come for brunch on the weekends your meal will be worth it I always get the Lumberjack eggs bacon AND pancakes now that s my kind of breakfast with an iced coffee which comes in an adorable mason jar all of which keeps me full for pretty much the rest of the day The gingerbread pancakes are my favorite and the creme brulee french toast is next on my list of things to try here Their baked goods which I drool over while waiting for a table are supposedly amazing but I never have room for them Some people have mentioned that the food is a little pricey but for brunch in Manhattan the prices are totally comparable and you get a good portion of food One thing to note the quarters are close so be prepared to possibly bump elbows with your neighbors 
5FIsRFY6VfFA9pqx-tQANg CMU If you go to Melba s do not expect 5 star or even 4 star service You will wait for a table and the people will move slower than you want them to That said the food is WORTH THE WAIT I came to Melba s last Friday night with some friends and we waited nearly an hour for a table and had to be seated separately at first they put our tables together once another party got up Once we ordered however the food came out in a reasonable amount of time My friend and I ordered the catfish strips as an appetizer which she enjoyed so much that she ordered them again for dessert The fried chicken is crispy on the outside juicy on the inside and incredibly flavorful The side dishes were also really good I normally hate the mac n cheese at soul food restaurants texture and taste are usually off but I really enjoyed Melba s tres mac It is still a restaurant so it doesn t quite reach grandma s kitchen level but it comes close Also this is not a hole in the wall greasy spoon The prices are very reasonable for trendy and delicious restaurant 
5H5qcmZGoy0FOkjv7T_CQw CMU There s not much more I can say than has already been said The chicken and egg nog waffles are to die for with the strawberry butter being a fantastic addition We two of us were there on a Sunday around 1pm and it was packed but we were seated quickly and served promptly So far this is my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood 
5mlbOs5gSXcmcj8TcUeS8w CMU Went here once and it was cute I don t know if I d go back though Maybe it was just what I ordered but it tasted very bland I had the grilled veggie sandwich All of the breakfast food sounded great however The service was great 
5rt2hD9Oy1iaPqteHxywHQ CMU For a dry as dust turkey sandwich on low quality white bread hurry to this restaurant 
5rwOV15AwKJx4BSt3gUHJQ CMU I always come here for breakfast and as a someone that likes to cook you have to appreciate eating here because everything they serve is homemade including the jam which changes flavors constantly It is really comforting to eat homemade cornbread with Apricot jam that tastes like your grandmother made it They have great omelets homemade turkey sausage and crisp bacon I have never had a bad breakfast here and my girlfriends and I like to meet up here for a slow and relaxing morning meal together We all like the Kitchenless which is egg whites hot smoked turkey and grilled tomatoes on top of toast It is supposed to be served on a biscuit but we have found that the biscuits although tempting seem to be a little heavy and a tad dry We have found that to be the case with the scones too But for hot breakfast coming off the griddle Kitchenette can t be beat It is the full package deal as far as breakfast goes in Morningside Heights Good food warm atmosphere decent service reasonable prices and a little off the beaten path I have also been here for lunch which is much busier and just as good The portions are hearty and the food was well prepared and fresh They have a bakery in the front which is expensive in comparison to the food Everything looks good but after a few tries with their cakes and cookies between my friends and I we were a little disappointed The cakes were heavier then they should have been the icings flavors were a tad off and the cookies weren t as delicious as they looked I don t know maybe we picked the wrong stuff I eat a lot of cake and Kitchenette gives baking the good ole try but it just doesn t meet the expectations you had hoped for which may be better for your waistline and your wallet So I would say pass on the deserts stick with the food and you should leave happy with a full belly 
5Vtekpm23yyLDfD-yNb8uQ CMU Wooooo beer and football Yep that s what happened tonight Good house brews I ll be going back for food Wooooooo I know this isn t review of the day material but deal with it yelpverse 
5Zbev986rvK6IvQc7HVqog CMU I lived in Ethiopia for two years and this place is by far one of the best Ethiopian places in NYC 
63DvXSks1tHIDajOGvwnRQ CMU I hear the food improves during the academic year but when I was there in the summer it was consistently horrendous And the lack of air conditioning certainly didn t help 
63vFIJZ960_VqkVAvn624Q CMU Good BAR FOOD WINGS ARE GOOD SANDWICHES ARE AWESOME Get there early sit on the ROOFTOP they close at 11PM weekdays Decent selections of beers THEY DO GET BUSY ENJOY 
6cPVxRaIyXMo7XEpLIALmg CMU Mac Cheese Country Yams and Coconut Cake 5Stars I often get the above with Pecan Tilapia and it s really good The chicken waffles are fun if you haven t had it before but that doesn t come with sides and if you leave without having the M C well just don t Personally I d like to see them pan fry the chicken vs deep fry but hey that s easy for me to say when I m not running the kitchen It s a little sense of pride that they are two blocks from our place in Harlem When the parents visit it s a must go the place is small but really well done If you want to go it s best to call ahead it s noisy on Friday night but no different than any other place in NYC enjoy the mac 
6HoJ7GJ2RYjJift2maYGaQ CMU This place is seriously awesome Good food selection Great place to go after work or have a nice dinner or lunch with a friend or a partner This place has one of the best margaritas its HUGE and only 4 bucks can t beat that I ve been there twice satisfy every time I go 
6PO3PhDh8vQFEFjjT8icIA CMU A staple among the Columbia grad student community The ales are delicous as are the burgers but the best part is the friendly staff and owner and the homely feeling you get as soon as you walk in 
6s0P8hgTSoNeu5IBDV7S7Q CMU Great diner feel without the greasy spoon Fresh ingredients but they definitely pack you in there We had the goat cheese omelette and a sweet potato french toast both were delicious 
6topqnT8SW7g0yvMDxBIBQ CMU Sweet Georgia Brown Harlem has a hidden treasure in its midst with Melba s contemporary style soul food with a menu playlist and layout reminiscent of the southern style home cooking experience I have tried to attend Sunday Brunch at Melba s but the line is typically out the door and around the corner Per the suggestion of a friend I called ahead this time and was able to make a reservation for three people very easily Arriving promptly at noon I finally got a look inside to see why the line is always so long the seating space only holds about 25 people The tables are small black and have a contemporary edge to them The bar has additional seating with a bistro style set up Though the look was sleek and modern the menu and gospel music playing in the background had an undeniable Southern Baptist church appeal The Southern Fried Chicken and Eggnog Waffles was an easy choice for me I salivated over the combination as soon as I found out it was on the menu With my southern roots I am no easy critic when it comes to soul food especially fried chicken That being said this meal blew me away The crunch on the outside of chicken paired with a juicy inside had perfect contrasting textures I savored every bite of the chicken then I began the task of devouring the waffles The waffles were an ingenious complement of flavors to the chicken There was a subtle sweetness to the waffles topped with strawberry butter that required only a small amount of syrup I could hardly converse with my friends as I engulfed the rest of my meal with small sips of coffee in between bites 
6yrJ5CmmtpNQiFQeEQQTqQ CMU Cakes and cookies are quite good even though they are a bit pricy 
6_EutMrDzfEn4nhRCgmTcA CMU I have to change my review After squirming around last minute to find a place that would accommodate 20 people for my graduation dinner Africa Kine was the only one who would do it for an affordable price it was great not to mention that they let us order from the dinner menu at 1pm when it generally isnt served until 5pm The trick was I called Alhasan the catering manager who organized everything for me Everyone loved the food and the service was pretty swift It was nice cause we were virtually the only one s in here I hope Africa Kine can have all its service be on this same par 
72CuGZWED3Yuui_NtD3GCg CMU Kinda like Roscoe s Chicken and Waffles but classier and with a Harlem twist No but seriously though this place is pretty good Really friendly service and I have to say the plain coffee was pretty good Met up with a few past colleagues here on a Saturday morning for brunch Great atmosphere and a cool looking bar There was wide array of food but unfortunately I did order the smaller of the dishes when compared to my friends Should have gotten the French Toast I instead got the salmon croquette which was good but wasn t too filling Definitely would come here again especially for the chicken and waffles and see if they compare to Roscoe s back in the West coast 
72dG3mUrdvM7MYpWmE8QsA CMU Was pretty underwhelmed at brunch remember thinking I m never coming back here again but all the fantastic reviews might have me convinced to give it another shot sometime Until then two stars it is 
790aoZjR4qGY1BcZ09RINw CMU Been living in the neighborhood for over 2 years and have neglected the nearby restaurants firstly because there aren t very many and secondly since I tend to meet friends in Hell s Kitchen all the time But finally I made my way around the corner for dinner with a friend coworker Amy at this cozy little uptown eatery Got there early so the place was quite empty leaving table choice up to us We grabbed the corner and our super friendly waiter got our drink orders and shared the specials A DJ was setting up near the windows and soon started spinning plenty of Luther s Christmas Album setting the perfect mood for a chilly winter s night meal The bar was full of the afterwork crowd quietly enjoying the atmosphere and their cocktails We shared a Mango Martini which was deliciously refreshing For dinner Amy thoroughly enjoyed Pecan Encrusted Tilapia with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and the Country Yams see below for description By the way she cleaned her plate I d say this was a fantastic choice I had the BBQ Meatloaf Two huge slices of perfectly cooked Turkey Meatloaf with just the right amount of slightly spicy slightly sweet BBQ sauce I couldn t eat it fast enough On the side I had the sauteed spinach with garlic and like Amy the Country Yams Oh those yams Every bite melted in my mouth sweet as can be YUM Needless to say we were far too full to even attempt dessert but I know I have to make a return trip just to savor their Sweet Potatoe Pie You should too 
7amGpGdL6wHjP-sUhYjn9w CMU Ok So Melba s had an advantage walking in the door We had just flown in from Los Angeles and hadn t had anything substantive to eat for about 12 hours picked a restaurant sort of at random and went to check it out We a bit disappointed that we couldn t be seated right away and had to wait about 15 min obviously not that big a deal for a Sat night except when you are starving We ordered drinks a Chambord marguerita for me and a mojito for the wife and appetizers chicken fingers and calamari The bartender suggested the catfish fish sticks so I took a moment to glare and her thought she may be telling something like we dropped the calamari on the floor you really don t want those so I switched the calamari and ordered the cat fish Turns out the catfish was simply amazing The chicken fingers were good but the catfish with a mustard dipping sauce on the side was out of this world My drink the marguerita unfortunately tasted like cough syrup I thought WTF then I remembered it was a Chambord marguerita what should I have expected At any rate I couldn t stand the Chambord switched it for the mojito that my wife was raving about Again awesome mojitos just the right balance of sugar rum and mint and the mint was mixed up really well I had the three cheese mac and chees pepper jack cheddar and mozarella simply the best mac and cheese that I ve had in my life No really it was that good For sides I had the country yams and roasted garlic mashed potatoes I expected the garlic mashed to rock While they were ok not bad just not outstanding the country yams were fantastic just the right consistency and not too sweet We ended up getting the calamari after all really very good if they did drop them on the ground they should continue to do so again very nice The decor is very nice dimly lit dark wood I imagine that this would be a great date place It is quite small it probably seats 30 people or less plus another 6 or so at the bar Our server was a beautiful bald black woman with a french accent and knew her job The woman at the bar was very pleasant as well though I didn t catch her name Even the host a man worked to make sure that we had a pleasant experience To be honest I don t think I d be giving any different a review had we come in with full stomachs It was really a pleasant dinner all around Thanks Melba s this was a great way to start out our NYC trip 
7B6_THWWAdFqhoKuWeudqA CMU The thing I love most about Kitchenette is that I know I m eating comfort food but the place is so darn cute that I don t feel greasy and bad about it The decor makes it a good place to stop by on its own Morningside Columbia doesn t offer much in the way of charming little restaurants but Kitchenette is cozy quirky and intimate if not a little cramped I ve been here for breakfast lunch and dinner and while the sandwiches are a bit so so the pancakes and french toast are fantastic and I certainly cannot complain about the fried chicken They give you pretty generous portions for the price and their strawberry lemonade is delicious Worth a trip if you re in the neighborhood 
7BVTiTlbqNJHbvi1buuFQA CMU Just moved to the area and headed out to try some of my new dining choices The service at Melba s was excellent and attentive with multiple extra items added on the house Every part of the meal was tasty if straight from an amazing grandmother s kitchen We had fried chicken with mashed potatoes mac cheese collards coconut cake and vanilla ice cream I will definitely be back too many things I haven t tried on the menu 
7csYAFP1nUT0mxEDKc1wkw CMU This place makes a frozen margarita like no other The first time I had one and by one I mean one plus half a one that I shared with a friend Cathedral Parkway was spinning by the time I had to walk down it When I got back to my apartment my apartment was spinning as well Absolutely well worth it plus the flavor combos you can choose between Magnificent They are only 4 during their Happy Hour and you get a good sized glass Please note Heather H s review of the margaritas because yeah Her review is 100 true Ha As for the food It s good Not great but good My friend and I have sharing a burrito from there down to a science Also they have a tasty veggie and goat cheese quesadilla In general it s a run of the mill place Not outstanding but great for a quite drink and dinner I always go back Their rooftop when it s open in the warm weather provides a nice atmosphere and a lovely view of Broadway down below 
7JTU_Fy97_0EQe-R4jX0CA CMU Its got a cold area and a nice rooftop thing going on I prefer the 2nd floor in AC Drinks I got were 5 each with free shots since we bought so much Food is ok sort of overpriced for the amount you get Not a bad place for after work and apparently the margaritas are good 
7m1_IAdJbxy6pIbqRht4Iw CMU Loved this place It s right on the edge of Harlem across from an interesting high rise housing project The place is quaint and the conversations are plentiful on a Saturday morning The turkey sausage were great and the grits were even better I recommend it if you are in the neighborhood and looking for a nice place to try out 
7OgtBg_B8PYV4McoGORfRw CMU TO ALL 1 STAR READERS LISTEN UP The review goes like this My gf and I went to Melba s to use our Groupon 40 discount thank god we didn t pay full price The first go around we didn t make reservations despite trying to call to make one they however don t answer there phone after 6pm So on the first go around we didn t get a table because the restaurant was PACKED a good sign we thought so we decided to come back for another try a week later boy were we wrong Strike 1 On the second go around despite making reservations for 7 15pm we weren t seated until 7 30pm despite being early and arriving at 7pm Strike 2 goes to the amount of time it took to even get served a drink and take our order 15 15 more mins 30 mins of nothing but seating so far Strike 3 went to cooking time I had the most expensive plate on the menu The Sea Bass for 23 and she had their infamous chicken and waffles Caution dark meat takes 5 mins more took 40 mins to get my puny dish and another 10 mins for my date to get her s we ve now been here for over a hour and they didn t even ask if we wanted more wine on the 2nd go around and what s up with serving in 2 tranches FOOD SHOULD COME TOGETHER PEOPLE Strike 4 is THE FOOD Thinking the most expensive thing on the dish would be half good THE SEA BASS but nooo it was tiny compared to the people around me who ordered the sword fish and other plates mine had to be the smallest there which prompted this review It also was sub par only warm not hot especially for the time we waited It also tasted like something I cooked at a university rez out of the frozen super market DISAPPOINTED Her chicken and waffles were tasty I have to admit but SMALL Seems like a soul food place with a minimalist dish not impressed I d say go to KFC and save the extra money and time Strike 5 came in getting any service at all for the bill or clean up with such a long wait line you d think they d be in a rush to seat as many as possible but noooo they take there time here too So all in all if you can afford to waste 3 hrs waiting for OK chicken and waffles steer clear of all else then MAYBE it s worth a look but would I go back again NO 
7pid33kkOZWVvMxV3Cytyg CMU I m moving to Washington Heights from the SF Bay Area in three months and I am VERY excited to be able to have breakfast at Kitchenette once in awhile So far I ve tried the Sweet Potato Waffles with Pecans and Apple Butter and the Kitchenless breakfast sandwich which is eggs whites smoked turkey and grilled tomato inside a biscuit Both were absolutely delicious the waffle was crispy and flavorful but not too sweet and the sandwich had some of the best turkey I ve ever had I would order both things again in a heartbeat On top of all that there are two things that kick Kitchenette up a notch first there is no lard in the biscuits Awesome Second everyone on the staff there was super friendly I look forward to becoming a Kitchenette regular in a few months 
7qveMCJ-TlrJOlKtjI9aWA CMU What a treat I went here for an associate s birthday The food and drinks were delicious and the live music was wonderful I had the catfish yams collard greens and mac and cheese The yams were my least favorite but everything else was yummy The restaurant was packed and ours was one of a few huge parties The waitstaff provided really great service The only snafu was it took quite awhile for our food to arrive However the staff was attentive and as efficient as possible I would definitely return to Melbas They could the folks at Billie s Black a lesson or five about customer service 
7r_oCJeh6_UV6Z8gCOY9WA CMU It s really hard to try a new place I felt like we were in a Brunch Rut tho and decided to look around for a new place I came across Kitchenette and am SO happy I did The look of kitchenette is a country kitchen There s great attention to detail So many fun design elements that make you move your head all around to try to see it all I loved the chalkboard menus glass jars as glasses The space is a crowded U shaped space We sat VERY close to another party of 2 basically sharing the same table with them But I think that s half the fun of breakfast Just don t go expecting to have a personal intimate chat Our orders of huevos rancheros yogurt w granola came super quick Our waitress was cheery and helpful Our mimosas were delish and our water in fun glass jars kept being refilled We waited maybe 15 min for our table It was a nice Sunday morning and there was room inside to stand and salivate over the yummy looking baked goods near the front There s counter space as well and a few ppl were there just having coffee muffin reading the paper I like that option a lot Love Kitchenette and hope to be back 
7sgmg-EdQLROaktkehor3g CMU nothing gets better than homemade biscuits i thoroughly enjoy their bacon egg and biscuit sandwich also their mac n cheese is probably the best i ve had east of the mississippi 
7Sv_mGjI3RHoIJQ0wTrcbw CMU I really hope that The Heights management including Feras reads this review I have never felt the need to post a review like this before and this saddens me because I m writing it for a place that I actually like PLEASE BE AWARE This update review is ONLY for the service from a particular waiter not for the restaurant itself I ve been here MANY a times and have brought many friends and will continue to return Did I mention I waited tables for over 10 years and am currently working in the hospitality industry for over 10 additional years The name of the waiter is JEAN PAUL or Jean Pierre This past Friday evening July 6 2012 I got together with my sister who was visiting from Chicago I wanted to introduce her to my inner circle of friends Since she s a Columbia graduate she wanted to give The Heights a shot as she never got the chance to come here while she was in school As it was a special evening I wanted our table of 7 to sit at the rooftop bar Upon coming up the steps there were three servers standing by the bar talking and laughing One waiter who ended up being our waiter for the night looked over at us continued talking and then after a minute sighed grabbed menus and knodded his head at us to follow him No smile no greeting no acknowledgement I had warning bells immediately but decided to ignore them BIG MISTAKE HUGE All of us started off ordering margaritas with extra shots none of them except 1 actually tasted like it had an extra shot the difference was quite noticeable You know what I m not going to get into details because I will get upset all over again since this was SUPPOSED to be a special evening with my sister who I hadn t seen in a year I will just sum it up to say Jean Paul acts as if he is doing a favor to the clients by waiting on their tables PERHAPS Jean Paul had an off day but the whole time he was dealing with our table he acted like a DIVA notice the capital letters unfortunately yelp doesn t provide underscoring bolding and flashing letters Even my brother who is quite the peacock said he was an over the top D I V A snap snap snap Jean Paul smiled not once Jean Paul did not interact with the table at all except to curtly take our order Jean Paul acted as if he was bothered by taking our order And WHY was Jean Paul wearing his sunglasses after sunset i could understand earlier when the sun was actually shining We asked Jean Paul to remove his sunglasses which he did He s a very young physically fit and quite attractive African American man I commented on how beautiful his eyes were and all I got was a face with attitude that said Honey please as he quickly turned and gave me his back LOL SERIOUSLY And no Jean Paul DIN T just give me his index finger with attitude after I was trying to get his attention for the longest while he was standing by the bar And no Jean Paul DIN T just pucker his lips when one of my friends pointed out he was brought the wrong beer And no Jean Paul DIN T just talk to my girlfriend in a dismissive manner who was asking if there was a spot to charge her phone This is the service we get on a 300 bill We would ve spent way more we just got really tired of dealing with him Every single person at our table HATED Jean Paul s service And for those of you who follow my reviews you know we are not an uptight bunch I was sooooooo close to asking for the manager but didn t want to make a scene since it was SUPPOSED to be a special night Grrrrr We mentioned all of this to Marat He is the waiter I ve had most of the time when I come to The Heights MARAT is awesome MARAT is sweet MARAT is very attentive MARAT smiles he s the one that made our night that evening even taking the time to talk with us about his culture when asked even though we were not one of his tables Next time I come to The Heights and I see Jean Paul I will be the one puckering my lips and giving him my index finger while I wear sunglasses in the dark So next time you go to The Heights look for MARAT not jean paul 
7Uo9JxrKLPP4I4g1YzlVqQ CMU Awesome margaritas and the food is just as good Have had the breakfast burrito the chicken sandwich and the chicken burrito all excellent choices The guacamole is on point They do not have many TV s but it is a great bar to grab a margarita or 3 and have some food with friends Friendly waitstaff and a welcoming place to hangout 
7XzJGv5cg97fGT-cS7TJyw CMU Came here for brunch and I was very disappointed The decor very crappy and old tables don t look clean People who like it have questionable taste level French toast has bread pudding like texture it tastes undercooked Biscuit it has some sort of meat grease on it Grits very average My bowl had a huge stiff grits ball in it that was inedible Overall it was a very disappointing experience I will not try any places that have less than 4 stars anymore 
7_K3rdySY6doOYpe__4yTQ CMU Everything I have tried in Haakon Hall was really good From the Fries to the Watermelon and blue cheese salad Crab cakes were good too From outside you can t tell how cozy it is inside My favorite restaurant in the neighborhood 
7_lpedQkYPPFKaUkH3GnZQ CMU Melba s is still the champion in Harlem on Frederick Douglass Boulevard I try and go at least once a month The menu has not changed much over the years but it doesn t need to In a way that is a good thing when you are hungry for something in particular and you know that it is going to be there You cannot go wrong with the catfish strips appetizer either the wine braised short ribs or the famous chicken and eggnog waffles entree s with the tres mac cheese and collard greens side dishes The whole menu is good but these are the dishes that keep me coming back The service is good and the waiters staff and Melba herself are very friendly and professional The place is small but has a great vibe cozy and inviting If you have to wait it s worth it Just grab a drink at the bar They have a good drink menu as well including the Rose Of Harlem kind of a margarita with a twist I predict Melba s will be around for a long long time 
7_Uf0rV4TZrPs2jtHtuR3Q CMU my lady friend is a southern gal and this is where she HAD to go for her bday after watching the bobby flay throwdown the catfish w chipotle mayo was off the see saw the chicken was pretty good i got the dark meat with strawberry butter the waffles were crankin the collard greens were good and the mac and cheese was good i was more impressed with the food than my country pardner i d give this place a 4 4 5 the service brings it down to 3 75 4 25 i was a bit let down and know that this place could easily be 5 stars with a few tweeks oh in case you don t see the sign the coat check is 2 
89v3c0Cp3zkhYotvBrV1cA CMU I concur with the other reviews they need to add more seasoning the fried chicken However I think the eggnog waffles and strawberry butter are worth the trip there I also enjoyed the black eyed peas and collard green spring rolls The red velvet cake was also excellent I will return and try a different protein Owners if you check out yelp take the customers advice and add more flavor to proteins 
8BhvH02SqeRVFmW754t5vA CMU Bad food Bad beer Good margaritas if the service is decent enough to get it to you before they melt Plus there are 2 sets of stairs which are a disaster if you are even the lease bit buzzed Why would you go here 
8HS5CCW9kjeTp6tYLEPD4Q CMU mmmmmmm BACON Perhaps one of the best omelettes I ve had in a while Delicious apple bacon with quality creamy cheddar delish Very good strong coffee too The biscuits were so good toasted and flaky paired with the creamed butter and fresh apricot spread so good my only complaint was that my brother s home fries were not entirely cooked through However they were nicely seasoned The servings of everything compared to those in LA was a bit on the small side The ambiance is very cute with old doors refinished as tables It s all very bright cute and happy feeling Clean bathrooms are also bonus 
8L1sxhJdXDFARwt-ANWNoA CMU Came here for brunch with a group and everything tasted amazing Service was friendly and drinks were quick to the table We will return 
8uDjrtfEXNG3J6e--HAjkw CMU Read a good review on urbansppon about this place and I was really glad I went with it The food was delicious especially the oven roasted half duck and the portion is generous with the price being very reasonable Originally I was only going to give this restaurant 4 stars because I thought the bread is a little difficult to swallow but given the super professional service the five stars are well deserved We stayed at the restaurant for 5 hours 2 of which were after we finished our meal but not only were we not pressured to leave they brought us more drinks 
8v4t1Q4yd6RQVF8c1eJ2bg CMU Terrible service We waited over an hour for our meal and when the food finally arrived I received the wrong order The whole time the manager was focused on texting instead of the customers and did not even both to visit our table to offer an apology Stay away from The Heights Bar Grill 
8XmPya03TYyi1u3rldIyGA CMU decent halal burgers sandwiches guess its closed now so watever 
92YwyGraqnqVL9D9TnOJKw CMU Hmmm what does it say about a restaurant when the owner offers you a free meal after reading your less than favorable yelp review you re too busy to take up the owner on his offer then he throws wild conspiracy theories about you across the internet a week later When I broke up with my high school boyfriend he tried to bribe me with flowers and jewelry Then when I finally dumped him he told all our friends I had cheated on him Cue flashback Awkward For the record I m just a poverty stricken grad student with no yelp affiliation who had not one but MANY encounters with bad service and mediocre food at this place The owner s paranoid and accusatory comments regarding my expression of my own opinion which is why we all yelp isn t it don t inspire any further confidence in the joint Sorry Haakon s It s not me It s you 
952GUcdfPha1myIm6P6TZw CMU I ve only been here once so far but I really liked it I sat up on the rooftop deck which is breezy enough and while the view if mostly of other buildings still feels like you re up a bit above the city Beer was good Service was okay we were there for a few hours but we were steadily drinking and even ate some cheese fries were in my opinion pretty good but I am not a seasoned cheese fry eater so I may be easily impressed When the waitress left us hanging for literally 25 minutes at the end of the night when we needed the check that was kind of a bummer I did not repeat did NOT have a chance to try the margaritas this time I was trying to stay sort of sober this particular evening HOWEVER a table near ours sampled the margaritas quite liberally I am guessing to the point that one of the ladies VOMITED UNDER THE TABLE I shit you not And fell out of her chair Luckily this was near when we were leaving so I didn t suffer any vomit stench and mostly tried to stifle my laughter at the whole scene Don t worry the drunk people were laughing too so it s not like I was totally rude On a more dour note I m not sure that anyone on the bar s staff was making any swift moves to clean up the barf Ew But ASIDE from all that I ll be back Because those margaritas must pack one hell of a punch 
97yN9AspcNPoJBsz9rBYzA CMU A little pricey for what you get but solid nonetheless 
9CNsF7cbHhA7ffzGFtRVaA CMU I wasn t too impressed with the food at Melbas However I do like the atmosphere I prefer Amy Ruth s food as opposed to Melbas food wise Didn t feel like there were enough options on the menu at Melbas I ve only gone to Melbas for dinner though 
9uOULbuFy8LUM2UqfmPJEw CMU Good rooftop with very reasonable happy hour without the price tag of a Manhattan rooftop and drinks I went here a while ago with friends I was traveling and they were attending school this is right by Columbia and interning living on a budget The bar had a surprisingly good selection of beers including local NY area ones that I enjoyed trying The waitstaff was nice to us as we sat there for a while without building up too much of a tab The roof was a bit small and atop some steep stairs If you get a spot up there I say sit down and enjoy Just be careful going down if you re sitting and sipping awhile 
9xHNYCDDG86n3oV5lRiFbg CMU The cakes they have are amazing especially the carrot cake The only downside is the restaurant is rather small and if you have more than a 4 person party you will never get a table 
9XIOuhV9tfmbGvRJQPTlvg CMU Great Soul food Great Spot We really enjoyed brunch here on Saturday The biscuits were so good and buttery My husband had to have the chicken and waffles after seeing the Throwdown with Bobby Flay and he was pleased My sister really enjoyed her sweet potato pancakes The music was nice and we loved the atmosphere in this modernly decorated restaurant We ll definitely go back 
A1yTBSLgEf46QNx2Qrnt1w CMU I LOVE the food here I had the turkey BLT with garlic fries The sandwich was huge and I was only able to eat half The other half I took home and shared with my grateful partner For desert I shared a slice of cappuccino cake with my buddy It was awesome with it s cappuccino cream cheese frosting So why only 3 stars The service we received today was TERRIBLE When we arrived it took a good 10 minutes for someone to come by with menus at least another 20 mins for someone to take our order and then almost a half hour to get our sandwiches We then wanted to have dessert and asked someone to send our server over guess what he never came We had to get up and ask the manager that we wanted dessert Granted the place was packed but I saw 2 people working the front counter with no customers and a manager who eventually helped us later with a very pleasant disposition appologizing for the lack of service Maybe it was a bad day but I couldn t let it go by without mentioning Consistency keeps businesses open in NYC The food and the shop are so great I don t want to see this place go under because of pissed off patrons ATTENTION MUST BE PAID 
aCh5SMBe-_FtOgl1c0Rlow CMU I believe this place hasn t been here that long but it s been here as long as I ve been in Morningside In fact I walk by the place every day and always see the chef owner outside smoking a cigarette I haven t exactly identified him but each time I stop by he s always there to make you feel welcome The menu is pretty eclectic including a pantry section serving pb js and other simple items Of course this scales up with some higher end entrees So far each time I ve gone I ve found something that suited my tastes and was not let down 
adR6BQtcZilCZmp5MPqS6A CMU I like Haakon s Hall I ve only had the food there once I believe it was a good burger and I had some of the salad that my accompaniment ordered and that was really good too The bar is well stocked though their drink menu is a little limited and I wish they had a few more beers on tap The BEST however are the fresh baked cookies for dessert Ooey gooey goodness The staff bartenders and owner are all very welcoming warm and professional Overall a really great place and highly reccomended 
aeTh6pjS2zQXORT0Bc2aNg CMU Unless you re a freshman at Columbia or looking to date one there is no reason to ever come here 
AFhdvO29G-rZe15ibYKoUw CMU Cozy unpretentious ambiance great service and absolutely delightful food I m a big fan of the Kitchenless smoked turkey and tomato on a perfect buttery biscuit as well as their pancakes and bacon Considering that it s at least 33 cheaper than Community Food and Juice which is delicious but overpriced this is def my first choice for brunch breakfast around Morningside Heights 
afJBMeKF08KmGGNQZ0Z7rA CMU Argh what a disappointment It s probably my fault since I didn t choose a brunch item But my chickpea sandwich was borderline inedible I mean I ate it because it was a 12 dollar sandwich but everything tasted like cardboard Even the sauce that came with it tasted weird The food also took FOREVER to come out which means it should taste BETTER since you re so darn hungry after the long wait But alas it was all gross Stick to brunch items or go to another spot to blow 12 dollars on lunch Seriously You know it s bad when the best thing you had was the hot sauce 
aMkAa_VG9V64Sp_GI5scww CMU My girlfriend led me to Kitchenette for dessert on a weekend night It s girly and it owns it which I appreciate Cute decor in a cozy interior we will be returning for brunch one of these days Unfortunately we took our delicious cupcakes to go so I can t comment on the service or general eat in experience hence four stars instead of five 
aMWCIHGBczK9-7vet_bdFg CMU take out for dinner turkey burger super dry and did not taste like a turkey burger more like a frozen thawed burger with no extra condiments garlic wedge fries had only 4 wedges for 4 50 complained to the manager via telephone and he said that they were busy and wouldn t be able to bring more fries really bad nuff said 
ApmlzaDbnIwU6XFvz-S_Mg CMU This joint is a cute little place and reminds me of Alice in Wonderland I visited this place on a couple of occasions for breakfast s and brunches I have tried the Lumberjack blueberry pancakes and omelet with avocado cheese and various veggies Honestly it was Okay I really didn t notice anything special or mind blowing about the concept of food here It seemed like a lot of Columbia students stop by here during breakfast brunch time and they could get pretty noisy here But overall a cute little fairytale place with mediocre to good food 
ARLtA_q_yv7jy1WxDZLOXA CMU When we paid the check and stepped out onto the street I wept a little It was that good It was a higher truth It was the breakfast of demigods Tender yet crisp fried chicken and egg nog waffles with strawberry butter thick real bacon coca cola with ice and non stop fresh warm biscuits with yellow ribbons of butter already in the dough And our waitress I almost kissed her She was warm and pleasant and attentive and she had all fine qualities that my ex wife lacked 
ASMuJZGURUfYTBpUTKD0_g CMU They know how to make a martini scallop appetizer excellent blackened catfish almost as good as Red Rooster 
ASu4Uab-1jkZDn6xBq_scw CMU Oh wow Amazing smothered chicken and eggnog waffles Amazing Bloody Mary s were awesome too Just the right amount of pepper The smothered chicken was amazing Cooked so tenderly and the gravy was out of this world The eggnog waffles were to die for and the strawberry butter was just divine 
ATFXQkSMYBSk4Dr7vbR_7w CMU Rusty and I were on the subway and hungry as usual when we decided that we would check out Kitchenette We had walked by it several times and decided to check them out during the late brunch lunch hour After peering at the menu outside we decided that the prices were reasonable so we stopped in Once inside Kitchenette you may think that you ve stepped into the world of a 8 year old girl playing tea time The front bar area is designated for those just dropping in for take out and the staff quickly ushered us to the back where we were seated in the dine in area However I was quick to eye the oodles of cakes cookies and treats that they had upfront and everything looked pleasantly delicious Once we sat down I eyed the decor the menu indicated that many of the tables were crafted from old doors to add a humble and welcoming feel The place was certainly welcoming it harbored on an almost European cafe atmosphere Our waiter Jon took our drink order which gave us time to peer over the menu He had mistakenly brought us two Seaside Summer Bliss drinks when we had only ordered one so I got to indulge a little The drink was quite good and light made from white wine and a peach puree Rusty got the Strawberry Lemonade I was eying the sandwiches on the menu and decided to go with the Grilled Ham and Brie sandwich Rusty got the Kitchenette Specialty turkey meatloaf and mashed potatoes I was rather taken with his choice since he swears that he hated meatloaf before I made it for him anyway Our food did not take too long to arrive but by the time it did I could already realize that this was probably Jon s first job as a waiter He was a bit awkward but friendly Anyway my sandwich was rather salty I was hoping that the spinach mornay sauce would balance out the ham and brie but the sauce was rather bland I appreciated the healthy portion of salad Russell s turkey meatloaf was pretty good and the mashed potatoes were decent The meatloaf lacked a little bit of a kick After eating our food I knew that I HAD TO HAVE one of their deserts so I settled on the chocolate layer cake with cream cheese frosting The cake was good but a little bit dry I wish that I had gone with my first choice chocolate peanut butter pie Would I visit this place again Yes For the atmosphere and to try the fried chicken it looked good 
A_-hJ1zTaPNYuIKbM-Nw-g CMU The dishes are great very traditional food from Africa Service needs to improve The wait time is like forever and the professionalism is just not there The 3 stars are for the food only 
B4Ev6vqxJBws4x4BTtqOfw CMU This place is an asian fusion seafood restaurant At least that is what I gathered is their specialty from their menu We ordered the calamari fritti which was excellent and the chicken quesadilla which was mediocre I really enjoyed the Spicy Trio Rolls and can say they are one of the best sushi I have had I will def be back to have this trio and try some of their fish dishes They serve a large variety of fish and seafood on their menu at reasonable prices Place is decorated with modern decor that encourages tranquility They also have a bar with sports draft beer and cocktails I had the ruby red cosmo and it was delicious I did not like the raspberry mojito and would not order it again too bitter Great Wednesdays specials 5 cocktails beer and select appetizers Will be back for goodness 
b9iCQUi98odKoXln8iNtLg CMU As someone who lives upstairs from this restaurant I would just like to ask all of you to stop sitting on my front steps on during the weekends It makes it hard to get to my front door That being said hopefully in the nicest way possible the food here is okay I do fall victim to eating here more than I like on those days I don t feel like cooking myself a meal T H and I usually come here for a late weeknight dinner and find the restaurant relatively empty save the die hard couple or stressed out Ph D student hunkered down to slurp down coffee and use the wireless T H loves their breakfast food and usually orders the Lumberjack The pancake flavors are usually good a mix of fresh berries and homemade batter but sometimes are a bit dry Not a huge fan of pancakes myself I go for the burger the salad or the soups here Their burger is actually quite good though cooking to order isn t really their specialty The meat is decent and the bun it is on is delicious however it tends to crumble the more meat juice it soaks up Accompanied with the burger is usually a nice few slices of garlic fries which vary from very strong garlic taste to none at all and a nice pickle The pickle is usually my favorite part but this pickle tends to either be under well pickled or overly pickled so that the flesh is soft and doesn t have that great crunch Of the salads at Kitchenette I usually opt for the Caesar salad and throw in some grilled chicken The chicken is nice and moist and cut up into nice little chunks for ease of eating but the salad itself varies Sometimes they add more cheese y salty homemade croutons which makes it a bit too salty even for a caesar salad My biggest complaint however is the overwhelming taste of anchovies that comes with this caesar salad I don t mind the taste if moderated by the appropriate amount of lemon and or pepper but more often than not I feel like I m eating anchovy salad rather than a grilled chicken caesar salad The ingredients themselves are usually nice and fresh so no complaints there perhaps a re tooling of the salad dressing would do this salad good If you re coming for a sit down the wait staff is pretty nice and give the restaurant a homey kind of feel The noise level gets pretty loud especially during lunch or brunch hours so if you re looking for somewhere quiet ask to be seated near the entrance of the restaurant All in all the food is decent but a little expensive considering you could probably make their menu yourself Oh and keep off my stoop just kidding 
bDSaHtrJygMbsmarjsV_pQ CMU It was just an okay place Food weren t that great there was very little of strawberry butter on my pancake which was the best part of the food Food came out fast but our waitress was very slow Their chicken with eggnog waffle was just okay There wasn t much meat on it the skin was crispy but the meat was dry Also the sweet potato pancake tasted like just any regular pancake at a diner The interior was nice and people are nice But overall I think Spoonbread on 110st has better food although it s less friendly and the service is much slower If you want to experience upscaled brunch in Herlem it s a good place since they even take reservation over the phone or via email 
bFMRWbKfFF7o-lzsVwsd8w CMU Solid 3 5 To be honest I m not really sure what is considered Scandinavian food besides the very stereotypical lingon berries and Swedish meatballs The menu consisted of a lot of comfort type foods stuff in the pot meats and potatoes smothered in sauce fish salads and roasted root veggies Eating at HH tonight with the rainy weather outside was like eating in the kitchen of the house you grew up in Comfortable plenty of dark wood puffy cushiony furniture and the service was super casual The foodwas just straight up salty flavorful hearty food The salmon salad had exceptionally crispy fresh greens and the meat patties hamburgers in sweet salty brown sauce were surprisingly tasty for their kind of scary description One of the best things to eat was the dessert a flaky apple turnover with ice cream and a cognac sauce I would go back if in the mood for this type of food niche craving 
BfYhigPB-hLRX8JmLjyWrw CMU Good coffee good food really adorable atmosphere good service Egg scramble with scallions and tomatoes and herbed sour cream was delicious Very ample portions Pancakes are ok not the best I ve ever had Food is a little pricey brunch entrees start at 10 with a few 8 exceptions If you live in the neighborhood this is a nicer place to go They also have a lot of really lovely pastries that I didn t try that look lovely 
BgBwnqDsRTrqqxnyvMEERg CMU I first checked out Melba s when it had just opened The food was OK but not great The staff however was so gracious and friendly that I grabbed a few friends and we returned a few weeks later This time I was pleasantly surprised Have you ever even heard of barbecued meatloaf I hadn t but I m happy that I tried it Delish The restaurant has a nice vibe friendly but still a little exclusive Just the way I like it 
BGrDxkHo5Kim5pR80iKgzQ CMU Wow I didnt think it would be such a small space Anywho we went here for brunch after running the Harlem Week 5k My friend had the salmon omelette homefries Cool thing about her fries was that they were made with both sweet regular potatoes Sure wish Id ordered those fries Instead I got the sweet potato pancakes with a side of cheese grits The pancake flavor was nice but they were awfully mushy inside We both had Mellinis to drink mango nectar cheap champagne All all Melba s was cool I d like to go again for dinner Saw a couple of children at other tables Maybe I ll bring mine next time Either way its good to know that I can By the way Melba s has a B rating from the dept of health 
BgShdS3_kQ-wohnPReIpOA CMU Quaint and unpretentious Kitchenette is without a doubt my favorite brunch spot and probably the only diner in NYC that I actually like to eat at Prompt seating and service I ve never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table or a few minutes for a waiter The space at this place is not very big though the most you can have at a table is 4 and if you are two if it is busy you will have someone sitting next to you at your table I ve never had anything bad at this restaurant and my favorite dish is the lumberjack with fruited pancakes I even liked the turkey sausage which is saying something because I don t usually like any kind of sausage that I like to drench with their genuine maple syrup There omelets are tasty as well and they will cook them dry I can t stand runny scrambled eggs or omelets upon request Be sure not to skip the display case at the front of the diner that is full of baked goods made at the restaurant 
bHhAJm3534DN9t3lBgwOnQ CMU Although it was small crowded and the hostess could not find my reservation that we placed a week in advance for a table We Had an excellent time for my past birthday dinner We was a party of 10 and the wait staff was amazing the food was traditional hands down the best time I had in a long while 
Bk4g9TcDdq8DOwPPl_lHkQ CMU They have the weirdest menu All of it tasted good 
bMdTt7tltla1sW05HxRspg CMU Very cute decor Friendly staff I can t speak for the other people I went with but I really enjoyed the Herb and Goat cheese omelet Fresh herbs used and they didn t skimp on the goat cheese I got the potatoes and was not as impressed but by far one of the best things was the biscuit I think that was quite possibly the best biscuit I have ever had My only pet peeve was that I ordered ice tea it came in a really small though cute class and did not get a refill on it 
bMwWkCHnR_NqsldNZNU4lw CMU There are some tasty tasty tasty things happening in here I ve only been here for brunch so far but I ve tried quite a sampling of the offerings It s hard to keep trying new things when the cheese grits are as delicious as these are when the bacon is as massive and amazingly crispy the sweet potato pancakes are fluffy and perfectly sweet and the eggnog waffles are light and crispy I shouldn t write this review while I m hungry Nor should I even THINK about Melba s when I m hungry Moving on from the food the service is kind efficient and well honest On one visit one of the servers took my sweet potato pancakes to another table by accident Our server who may have been Melba herself apologized profusely and brought me an ENORMOUS mimosa that was basically straight champagne with a shot of orange juice while the cook remade my order Not only did I get what looked like an even larger helping of sweet potato pancakes i also got a big old bowl of cheese grits since I had to wait My entire meal ended up being taken off the bill It s a nice gesture and I know it s not unheard of for places to do things like that when someone s order gets screwed up but that one incident will definitely keep me trekking uptown to get my delicious carby brunch on 
BODscvqUbcERdklpAsFxIg CMU This place is in the middle of the Little Senegal neighborhood and when my friend and I walked in we felt like we were transported right out of cold concrete NYC into West Africa I would say one would have to be comfortable with going to Harlem and being in a very foreign seeming setting to enjoy this place There were tables of Senegalese hanging out socializing over food and drinks really a fun experience to sit in the midst of this A casual atmosphere The waitress was very quick attentive and nice and we were two women I see some reviewers recommend going with men to get good service and the food was great I had lamb with rice with stewed onions on the side and an extremely hot little green pepper on top be very careful and my friend had the grilled whole talapia fish The food was very tasty and fresh I love the mix of spices used in West African food very flavorful without being spicy The check came quickly Everything is very affordable for New York City as well as for the size of the portions 11 for my dish and 13 for my friend s fish if I remember correctly I will definitely go back and recommend it to friends 
BPc22uAggM5IL74vSc-_gg CMU My cousin and I came to 107 with a Restaurant com voucher We weren t feeling the A C too much in the front so we made our way to the back right by the kitchen Our waitress was perfectly nice She brought us more bread when we scarfed down the first basket and she kept our water filled The menu was all over the place To me that s often a sign that there won t be one good cuisine And that s kind of what we felt The burger was bland and my cousin had to ask for cajun spices The sushi was fine but I ve had fresher tasting All in all pretty meh 
BPiM6_IEANFuB8BSOfdM0Q CMU Brunch is awesome and dinner is like Thanksgiving I ve only had their carrot cake once Luckily Saint Luke s Hospital is less than 10 blocks away so that they could rush me over to put a stent in my artery Had four forkfulls and had to finish the rest for breakfast I d gladly go back for more carrot cake but have never seen it there since I had a friend who once went and returned her take out dinner because when she picked it up she saw a cockroach In the process of returning the dinner she asked if she could have some cake I guess it s that good 
bquqKcmBiX_nJo0DX6m0XA CMU So I come here because my brother keeps telling me about how great he hears its supposed to be and how good the fried chicken and waffles are here Let me be the first to tell you guys this place sucks Me and my brothers come here and all of us order the chicken and waffles After waiting forever for the chicken to get to our tables we tried it and we all agreed that it was pretty terrible the chicken was probably the most bland tasting fried chicken I ve ever had It wasn t even that hot which makes me wonder if they actually cooked it or let the chicken rest under a heat lamp The waffles with the strawberry butter were okay at best the sides were definitely better but not that great either and neither were the portions the mac and cheese was pretty bland although the mash potatoes and grits w cheese were good Overall going to this place was a waste of time if you re looking for some good fried chicken and you see Melba s run away and head straight to the closest kennedy fried chicken KFC or Popeye s 
bR0MiBYvO-WFzPU5Ww9KGQ CMU Most peoples complaints seem to be about the lack of space here It is a little strange to be placed at a table with strangers a very small table but hey this is NYC it s bound to happen I stopped in with my bf for a Sunday brunch We got there around 10 45 am which was definitely a good time because when we left there was quite a wait I had the cottage Which is scrambled eggs with swiss bacon and caramelized onoin WOW It was awesome full of flavor It came with a nice toasted English muffin and potatoes as well The potatoes are one reason I can t give the place 5 stars They had no flavor I had to pile on hot sauce and ketchup My bf got the gingerbread pancakes and let me tell you we d go back just for those They were sooooo good Such a great fall menu item He said his scrambled eggs were just ok Our sever was very friendly and fast I would definitely come back especially to try one of their famous flavored mimosas 
Bt0h7OjubWL_LOZHDdVpJQ CMU Like eating a homemade quilt made of biscuits 
BTcGbRStbVcv7_3g-KH2ew CMU I ve only ever eaten here for breakfast brunch but I think that s enough of an experience to say this place is great Why THEY HAVE BISCUITS Biscuits are hard to come by in NYC But Kitchenette has them AND they are delicious It can be a bit crowded but fortunately it is in a neighborhood where it doesn t get too crazy until the typical brunch times I ve also indulged in their desserts a couple times Wow 
btEOWltKiHydnDjLd31yzw CMU I ve only eaten in the restaurant once but it was a great experience My food herb and goat cheese omelette with a biscuit and cheese grits was delicious and filling Between this and the peach smoothie also delicious I was stuffed before I could even finish my plate I ve also gotten cakes from here and they ve invariably been delicious Sweet but not too sweet perfectly moist and dense Yum 
bUUWCycoLya0uAWWop1MqA CMU Came for brunch here yesterday with my GF and two other friends I ll start with the decor because that is actually more memorable than the food Its a bright place which all appeared to be used 50s 60s diner furniture Wainscotted walls painted pink made me feel a bit as though I was in the bedroom of a adolescent female The place was crowded and a bit loud but it was expected due to the impending St Patrick s Day parade of the day It wasn t unwelcoming in any way My GF ordered the Chipotle Turkey Hash with Sweet Potatoes and Corn and I the Lumberjack with gingerbread pancakes coated with some pumpkin jam The pancakes were very good and its notable that the maple syrup they serve isn t store bought Aunt Jemima My eggs were cooked to order and though I prefer my bacon crispier they weren t too salty and tasted fine To quote my GF on her turkey hash It was a tasty healthy choice but nothing spectacular The check came out to a bit more than I would ve expected for that type of food for four and I really do feel as though there nothing that would draw me back there again as there are new places to eat in that part of the UWS sprouting up every day For those drivers out there parking can be found before noon rather easily along Riverside Drive 
bxF7vbXivrM4Ore-QL48OA CMU Great food Love Tuesday s 
bYCmlphWplDisx7-hYgpbw CMU Had reservations and was still asked to wait Oh I thought that is why you make a reservation See thats the thing every one says wait stuff was awful but food was good and worth the wait I DIDNT WAIT And it was incredibly small codeword intimate Greeting service and interactions are everything If they can learn that it would be nice From the other reviews now im curious about the food maybe I will try again if im not actually hungry 
BytqJc5YWviNjtVof33ZQw CMU Pretty good food but very collegiate in atmosphere Don t plan to take home extra food bc it doesn t keep well 
bZujHIg-y-31gsEAriF25Q CMU We came on a pretty busy Sunday night and we party of 2 didn t have to wait for a table They even moved us to a more intimate spot once one opened up The decor is lovely high ceilings with beautiful cream lamp shades and wrought iron chadeliers It has a very cozy but not cramped feel to it The drinks and food are very reasonably priced There semed to be only one waitress 2 managers and a food runner But we didn t have to wait too long for anything The fried catfish fingers were delicious with a spicy remoulade an appetizer or perfect portion of you just want a little something to nibble on and to save room for dessert My friend had the fish and chips which were pretty standard nothing out of this world but good and reliable I had the coconut pineapple cake It was pretty good the icing was a little too sweet but that s my only complaint about the entire night I d certainly have the cake again I will absolutely be back and possibly on my birthday because twice while we were there the owner manager erupted into a jubliant rendition of Stevie WOnder s Happy Birthday and encouraged the whole place to join her and brought out red velvet cake for the 2 birthday people It made me feel special and they weren t even singing to me My date was a bust and he spent half the night on the phone FAIL But dinner at Melba s definite WIN 
c8-fmeIV2JtN4xQWrBrwjg CMU A favorite NYC hangout that will definitely be missed While attending Columbia I frequented The Heights for their happy hours and margaritas while catching up with friends Eventually a few visits turned into weekly visits to the point that I needed a Heights detox I began to feel like a regular and came to know one of the owners many bartenders and other fans I have enjoyed every item off the menu that I have ever had wings burgers salmon wraps etc and enjoyed the cheap tasty drinks even more Oh and lets not forget BRUNCH 9 95 an incredible deal amongst so many other NYC rip offs 
C9s0LU9N0JL7asO2bXMbGw CMU 107 West has a loyal following among its neighbors and I can see why Speak to anyonee who has eaten here and they will probably tell you they love the place Count me among them 107 West is a very understated restaurant with terrace seating up front bench seating and spacious tables in the back with a few interesting nooks and crannies and art on the walls and a 10 seat bar in the middle always tuned to the local game usually the Yanks Personally I love sitting at the bar where Andrew has been tending for about 10 years off and on It s a friendly bar and the perfect place to have some dinner on your own If you want to chat with the friendly locals next to you it s no problem If not no big deal In other words it s a great bar dining spot As for the food I always get the fried chicken This dish is just so great that I cannot force myself to order anything else on the menu Others you know you re out there know my plight I m sure the fish specials are excellent and I ve heard the pork chop is sweet I imagine most everything on the menu is pretty good but the fried chicken at 107 is world class It comes as a half chicken with choice of a side read fries and collard greens It s perfectly juicy never greasy always consistent In fact 107 West gets my vote for most underrated fried chicken in NYC In a neighborhood not lacking for its fried chicken see Miss Mamie s Spoonbread and Rack Soul 107 holds its own And then some 
cbcBVg53LNAvvl1rQZTmew CMU I will upgrade KU one star because of the Lumberjane two eggs bacon or sausage and subbed in 2 baked French toast Paying 16 for the LJ is a little steep but it sure is delicious 
CBp3VzZFqiXio3Z42fKh3g CMU Melba s is the kind of place that doesn t make you mad when you go out Some places have poor service poor drinks a terrible staff but Melba s is none of those things Melba s is just a simple and comfortable spot and has THE best mac and cheese in all of Harlem If you can t decided on where to go in Harlem then Melba s will never disappoint you 
CC3dB8Zc1sAnJ8d1dsIsWg CMU I ve found the food at this restaurant fairly tasty on multiple occasions and even my German girlfriend had good things to say about their Bavarian Platter But hey this is New York and a good restaurant isn t just the food right My overall read on this place is that its run by people who try very hard but come up short sorry guys not a personal comment The negatives Well the service needs work in a lot of ways I agree with previous posters the bartender can come off so strange as to make the drinking experience a negative one I was happy to call the previous incarnation of this place my local bar and I now avoid this one like the plague because of this very reason The waitstaff is eager but seems inexperienced We asked for water we didn t get it Apparently my dinner came with a salad which perhaps I should have realized but tell me that before you bring it so I can tell you what dressing if any I want The owner manager person on the scene was trying to help and failing Every previous interaction I ve had with management at a restaurant especially owners is that they may stop by and very politely ask if you re enjoying your evening This person hovered within 10 feet and stared He was also dressed in a trenchcoat and I honestly thought at first it was just a crazy person Sorry pal 
cdxeKp9GzkFzRRZu6nZerQ CMU I used to live in the neightborhood and was excited about getting a chance to have another drink on thier roof deck I had fond memories of sitting up there with a book a margarita and some tasty food and getting some sun My friend and I ordered just Sangria So this review is based on one drink and no food which I will admit maybe unfair But the Sangria was so bad I felt the duty to warn y all Do go to the Heights Do enjoy their food which looked tasty and thier roof deck It has a retractable glass roof It started raining while we were up there and the staff had us safe and dry in less than 2 minutes Just don t order the sangria Stick to beer or maybe a mixed drink instead 
cGfornsSSOA1xv-XG6AfsQ CMU This place was spectacular I was feeling the vibe right when I walked in Music playin chicken n waffle eatin joint that has really tasty food Everyone who dines here must eat their Chicken and Waffles from the Best Thing I ve Ever Ate Typing this review is making my mouth water Fish and Chips were excellent too and lightly battered just how mamma likes them All of their side dishes were fantastic as well I just wish this place wasn t so damn classy and elegant I mean when you re eating chicken and waffles in Harlem you want to feel like you re eating chicken and waffles in Harlem Way to go Melbas We will be back 
cgmf4snF1GBkD_UzX6McIw CMU the food was decent the service um not so much let me clarify the service from the hostess was pfft the seating area is so tight that we practically needed a lubricant bleh i m tired of writing about this place 
CICye9kjiOAyWq9noJfatw CMU Why do college kids drink such disgusting things I mean they have access to all the normal alcohol that you would find in a bar they just choose not to drink it At The Heights you can observe college students in their natural habitat and here are some of the things I ve observed All of the mixed drinks here are served in pint glasses to ensure maximum drunkenness The pint size long island iced tea coupled with a shot of jager is apparently a winning combination These were lined up on the bar like I ve never seen anywhere else They drink double shots of bottom shelf tequila Why Is one shot not sufficient enough to get you disastrously wasted Or is the tequila so bad you have to get as much down as possible at one time They serve the rainbow shots here as in you have to do a shot of each color of the rainbow It s disturbing to see such brightly colored venomous liquids lined up and meant for human consumption It s like ordering seven tiny glasses of MASSIVE HEAD SPLITTING HANGOVER The staff swears that the pint size frozen margaritas contain six shots of tequila per I m not sure if this is possible or legal but I do know that the first time I came here a few years ago I had three of them and when I got home I spent the rest of my evening throwing up Which never happens So maybe it is true I do know it was like reliving the good ol college days just not in a good way I ve been going to The Heights on and off throughout the years as I live nearby and I am friendly with a few of the people who work there It is by all means a successful Columbia bar Plus the roof deck is great in the summer But while I hate to say this about anything in this case it s true I m just too old for this place So there 
Cj8bjQWQUS2e4wSbV0BTNg CMU A friend recommended this restaurant to me a couple years ago I have the I m not going uptown mentality when there are so many nice restaurants in Brooklyn I am so happy it took some out of town friends staying in Harlem to get me out I suggested Melba s and it was an instant hit The atmosphere was very friendly The food was satisfying and the sangria is delish I will be back 
ck5ANI8aLoW_lJN22yAczA CMU This place must have really let itself go since they were featured on Food Network or when they managed to rack up 4 stars on Yelp I wandered in and hesitantly sat myself down at the mostly empty bartop passing a huddle of confused looking people standing in the entrance I stayed for fifteen minutes completely ignored A few disgruntled would be patrons stood outside and complained This is the last time I try coming here They go changing things up every time Kitchen closes at 3 We were here before 3 If we had reservations this would be a different story And off they went in a huff to walk the couple blocks over to Amy Ruth s another stalwart in Harlem comfort food I went back in and flagged down one of the harried waitresses behind the bar Can I make a reservation for tonight She nodded enthusiastically and disappeared with a quick Hold on The minutes ticked on and she was nowhere to be seen so I finally admitted defeat and went across the street to Society Coffee where I was greeted immediately at the door Determined to give Melba s another chance after all busy is good I returned a few weeks later with friends in tow and a reservation This time there were empty tables and no wait Despite this the noise level was incredible We could barely hear each other or the server As you will discover in a moment the server evidently could not hear us either I asked about the salmon croquettes which she described in a manner that suggested she had never tried them herself I think they re fried umm like crab cakes except with salmon Naturally I decided against those and ordered the salmon omelet instead When our orders finally arrived about thirty minutes later they brought me the salmon croquettes Thankfully they did not give me a hard time and took it back immediately to exchange it Looking back I realize I should have just ordered the chicken waffles The salmon in the salmon omelet was dry and too salty and there was nothing to pull the flavors together with the egg The home fries were good if cold and portions so small that at the end of the meal I was still hungry Normally I can only finish half of the standard American sized portions served everywhere these days and take the rest home My friends who were starving were clearly not impressed either One of them ordered the smothered chicken and the chicken was so dry he could barely scrape it off the bone with his fork and knife Another ordered a 3 glass of OJ that had so much ice in it that it was gone in three sips But the worst of it had to be the coffee A place with 10 14 entrees at brunch should not be serving coffee that tastes like the watered down swill you find at highway filling stations Especially when just across the street is a place that s serving the good stuff for the same price I will give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that it s just their brunches that are completely hopeless but it s unlikely you will ever catch me in there again 
CKEPof2kvN8Eo2Su3_3WKQ CMU Not a bad place to stop in for a beer but nothing special about it 
cm6HD8lF76UdvjqApSV9tQ CMU The prices here are quite reasonable especially the drinks at happy hour and Sunday brunch And they re decently strong too The food is nothing fancy but I would say it s good If you want to have leftovers to take home the best deal is probably a Heights burrito as I ve never seen anyone male or female eat an entire one For some reason the burrito seems like much more food than the other dishes except for the 10 nachos which are almost obscenely large Vegetarians like me have more choices here than at comparable bar grill type places but I have also heard that their hamburger is good French fries are above average The bar scene is full of Columbia kids Emphasis on kids if you know what I mean The rooftop bar is pretty cool 
cNEN3NMklMxyKjJ0FNSO5A CMU We go to Max Soha next door regularly but had never tried Kitchenette until last Sunday for brunch We got a little bored with the overpriced and often not too great brunches on the Upper West Side I had sweet potato and turkey chipotle hash with over easy eggs biscuits and my husband had some kind of a ham and cheese omelet He loved it The sweet potato hash could have been a little spicier for me when I see chipotle I expect a little heat but the eggs were cooked perfectly and the homeade biscuits were really light and fluffy and so good with the strawberry butter and peach compote I also appreciated a generous and un iced glass of fresh squeezed grapefruit juice The desserts looked very tempting but we were too full The place has a homey bakery vibe that was laid back and fun and is a better value than the cluster of brunch places in the W 70s 90s will return 
CoEUQ9AG86TeKYRGC2BCqg CMU The front of this place looks like a greenhouse Weird facade but once you enter the main dining room decor becomes quite cool with blue lights and a waterfall Prices are reasonable The hangar steak spinach and mashed potatoes were delicious The menu has too many types of cuisines though I didn t order the sushi since I prefer to see it made in front of me at a sushi bar I always try the local brew on tap Red Wagon IPA from the Fire Island Beer Company complemented my meal perfectly I would go back just for drinks Plenty of local Yankee fans at the bar 
cOXHKNqBoMMUQvK9NU9gcA CMU I actually stumbled upon Melba s after attempting to have brunch at the restaurant across the street I left because once again it was taking cash only Boy was I in store for a treat I absolutely fell in LOVE with Melba s From the moment I walked through the door the warmth and spirit literally and figuratively of this restaurant greeted me with open arms Melba was at the door ready to take my coat and the place was packed with happy bubbling people it was almost like walking into one big family Thanksgiving dinner at Grandma s house The music was the perfect combination of jazz and soul and everything down to the christmas decor and art in this place just made you feel so at ease The food was impeccably good and the drinks were divine The fabulous service was simply icing on the cake but our waitstaff was incredibly attentive and welcoming This place is the true essence of what Harlem dining should be I love it 
CpGtWC6TwXG4QDCM46P2Cg CMU This place is awesome Best waffles I have EVER had Catfish is pretty solid as well as are the spring rolls Melba is a real sweetheart to She came up and spoke with us while we waited for our food If you re in Harlem pay this place a visit 
cQEGKai_NDcY6Wxij_ktrA CMU I love me some down home cooking okay My mother is from Arkansas and I grew up in the vast comfort food choked suburbs of Detroit I know from comfort food And having recently moved to Harlem one of the things I was most excited about was the abundance of soul comfort food restaurants Um yum Thanks Now Imagine my excitement when I realized not only that this place Melba s is literally around the corner from my apt but also has CHICKEN AND WAFFLES Holy baby cheeses And so one Sunday with a New York Times tucked under my arm because don t you feel that despite its belated lack of journalistic integrity it has a certain delightful New Yorky quaintness I skipped down to Melba s for what I was hoping would be a delicious salty sweet gut bomb Instead here s what I got A looooooong wait to order And by looooooong I mean looooooooooong A waitress who seemed totally unbothered by how loooooooong everything was taking A loooooooooong wait for my food And by looooooooooong I mean looooooooong Sidebar this last part is curious since when the food did actually arrive it had CLEARLY been sitting beneath a heat lamp for DAYS To continue the list of what I got Fried chicken with a ceramic skin that could chip a tooth and meat made of desiccated suede Oh and cold A cold waffle made of pulverized styrofoam packing peanuts A strawberry butter to accompany said waffle that was actually delicious A coffee refill that was cold no not not hot Seriously Cold All in all deeply disappointing I know Melba s was featured on the Food Network One wonders if she reserved the good stuff for the TV cameras Sigh Won t be back 
CrRXQbssWrKrOEf29NS9bg CMU Went in for dinner this past Sunday and I must admit I was about to write an unflattering review based on the lackluster service we received but after speaking with the General Manager the following day he took swift and meaningful action to make up for our experience THANKS MATT So instead of a 1 star review based on service the 4 star review was based on EXCELLENT food I had the Salmon mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach company had Fried Catfish Mac cheese and greens My salmon was a bit dry but that was my fault for ordering it med well but the flavor profile was delish The catfish was heaven light flaky crispy and perfectly seasoned sides were great as well Thanks to Matt we ll be back 
CsHOZL9LyPDEhFD-MWaQ-A CMU Went with a large group for a b day party dinner The mac n cheese and catfish strips were amazing Nice ambiance Small spot so not great for the large party we had even though their staff was very accommodating 
ct-mcaSGklPgJwlQUG4KYA CMU I ve been coming here for drinks for almost a year and I ve always enjoyed the atmosphere the music the space and the outdoor seating The drinks are pricey but great beer selection I keep coming back for their home brewed beers Haakon s Ale and Seasonal Ale are the best I finally ate here the other day and I ve gotta say the burgers are phenomenal Costly but it s hard to find a burger like that in the bar worth every penny 
cUGQFgkJII98vps1kvNjFw CMU I went here on a warm spring night towards the end of their happy hour The place was super busy but we were able to get a table for 2 on the rooftop which was my sole reason for wanting to check the place out Service wasn t bad despite being pretty busy I had buffalo calamari which was decent The wings looked great but I didn t try them Next time Drink specials were nice since it included wines too After happy hour I switched over to sangria and it was pretty good if a little weak alcohol wise I d come back again but maybe on a weeknight when it hopefully is less busy Oh and the night I was there they were playing horrid 90s alternative crapola that I became sick of hearing long before the radio business went south I wouldn t be surprised if I heard Hootie and the Blowfish there Someone should tell them haha 
cx2HmFBV0_jfSDzLj0mCSg CMU I imagine that the Heights Bar Grill is like a template for one of the hangout joints you see on most sitcoms a little loud very friendly very casual and maybe not the best food or service ever but good enough and certainly comfortable enough to keep you coming back It s nestled on the 2nd and 3rd Floors next to Vareli After a walk up a flight of stairs you pop open the door and into a friendly and a little sloppy place We got our seat a bit improvised but right away After pouring over the menu which was a little confusing I decided on the jerk chicken They did let me substitute potatoes for a double vegetable big plus brought us some bread on request and free of charge and were pretty snappy about all of it The jerk chicken had quite a kick to put it mildly Sides were simply steamed broccoli and spinach with tomatoes all very generous portions This is definitely a place I would return to were I in the area I might not go to the area because of it But you wouldn t get a fight out of me if you suggested we dine there 
CXvtEtC53kYTlgr61F5hsA CMU A nice spot around columbia love the rotisserie chicken very tender and lots of flavor tried a type of norwegian sausage with beef and lamp no special but like it also tried the pork one of the monday special can t remember the name love it it s a cozy and warm place perfect for chatting and a drink and they give cooking class too 
CYbrVC4SzW19_KnJjVSemA CMU This place is hands down one of the best brunch place that I have been to in awhile The wait wasn t bad at all Ten minutes for a party of three on a Sunday around brunch time The service was fantastic Our waiter was Kevin whom was very attentive Now to my favorite part THE FOOD Me and my lady got the vanilla stuffed French toast which was very very good We also got the spinach omelete which was okay Make sure to try their butter which is homemade As for the decor it was very interesting let s just leave it as that I love this place and will come back again for brunch 
cYpLClI8RI1fAHKugEWLCw CMU I have always enjoyed Kitchenette s home style cooking Everything is fresh and you do feel like your at home The mac and cheese is heavenly I also recommend their salads with the home mustard vinaigrette dressing The portion sizes are good not to mention the price fits the meal 
CzvUZ_q6JHL8mp89R-Yf7Q CMU 4 for huge frozen margaritas Good steak chicken wings enough said only thing don t go at night on the weekends it ll probably be packed with undergrads 
d1P6_9dD1WSTSPp-cZYOyw CMU Great place Small nice restaurant with a really warm feel to it Went at 1 PM on a Sunday with three other people No wait but it definitely got crowded quick They brought us warm biscuits with raisins gratis and water quickly They were playing John Legend and Erykah Badu softly in the background so I was a happy girl I ordered the coffee 3 and didn t get a refill wouldn t do it again and Southern Fried Chicken and Pancakes You can have the chicken dark or light and it comes with two large pancakes and a small assortment of fruit The food was brought to us quickly and so very good The chicken was cooked well and juicy and the two pancakes were the size of the plate I had to take one home Love Melba s I will definitely be back for brunch or maybe dinner next time 
d5IfIbyFUZufFecDSknuNA CMU All around a disappointing experience The line outside and the word of mouth really built this place up Wait wasn t too bad though for a party of three on a Sunday morning Once inside it took our extremely nervous but altogether very sweet waitress about fifteen minutes to find us and ask whether we wanted coffee and water Oh and food All arrived eventually but hype proved sadly incommensurate to tastiness My omelet brie and spinach was good grits were okay but my biscuit was dry and salty Smothered it in some bland strawberry butter circulatory system be damned My companions fared much worse a baked hunk of french toast that was somehow flavorless with maple syrup so watered down that it had the viscosity of well water If prices were a bit lower this place would eek out another star But in fact they re pretty high for egg centric breakfast fare As a Southerner might say that dog don t hunt 
d9TC0KRycFDXgzTvmD6IAg CMU Brunch at Melba s is amazing They have numerous items all or which sound lovely however the eggnog waffles are the best thing on the menu Accompany your waffle with a crispy flaky piece of catfish and you ll have the best brunch in life Also if you re a boozer like myself I highly recommend the mango mimosa The bartender isn t stingy on the pour so you get a nice bang for your buck Service is here is friendly and the atmosphere is great Definitely one of Harlem s best restaurants 
DapIBK7aZ1RSPmTBqeW_cQ CMU I hate the wait I hate the walk and I hate the cramped tables I do love the decor the mason jars the salvaged barnyard doors and the maple syrup Mostly I go because of my boyfriend He loves this place biscuits turkey sausage grits thick slices of sugar cured bacon it was always like a kid in a candy shoppe People come for the Southern appeal but I never understood Why Kitchenette when you can have amazing grits at Charles Southern Kitchen or Miss Mamie s Spoonbread 2 a few more blocks uptown When I lived on 113th street I was always so reluctant to walk the seven or so blocks to Kitchenette I also always found it a little disappointing that breakfast brunch service ends at 4 30pm They seem like a place that should be serving up farmhouse breakfasts all day though I hear dinner is not bad as well Ultimately if you are in the mood for eggs sausage bacon grits or biscuits Kitchenette is a fine choice It s cheaper than Community and they won t charge you for every extra side If you want pancakes however I d recommend Community for their amazing blueberry pancakes and to die for butter Pancakes waffles and brioche french toast aren t bad at Kitchenette but the extra 3 for pancakes and absurd wait at Community are totally worth it I promise Go to Kitchenette for brunch with your girlfriends You can squeal over how cute everything is and then split a huge slice of cake 
DBsMAGMCAc0k2K_SEfoWXA CMU i m sure their brunch is really good as that s what all the yelpers are raving about however i stopped in for breakfast one monday morning and was not impressed i m a french toast girl so imagine my utter disappointment when i found out their stuffed french toast specials are only available during weekend brunch i reluctantly went with their normal homemade brioche french toast and it was so AVERAGE nothing special just a normal slice of toast with some maple syrup the best breakfast deal is by far the kitchenette special two eggs bacon and cheese on a biscuit and includes coffee all for 7 as for the place itself i like it it s quaint and has pretty tight seating but a fair amount of tables it s eclectic but homey at the same time and the service is friendly enough if not a little slow for a monday morning 
dDKef4gdqOlQp8DC3Rn1vw CMU Went there with a friend around 10 on a Saturday night although from reading the other reviews it seems like we should ve gone for happy hour Decent atmosphere though I got the Atomic wings which were pretty good but they got cold half way through eating them This place scored big with me for having Sly Fox pilsener on tap however it took about 25 mins to get served I hear the burritos are the bee s knees Maybe I ll find out one day 
DDnlLrFU3-rYZjfIS-jlGg CMU From my admittedly limited experience Kitchenette is in the run for Best Pancakes in NYC Plus the setting is really nice and there s lots of great cookies and pastries to go It s really a nice place to have breakfast or brunch Only problem My waitress who was in a real rush to see me leave She seemed annoyed that I was confused where I should pay and didn t seem to like me taking a picture of the counter Oh well can t have it all 
dHUkAcNsi872ODsjjQxmCA CMU Soul food just amazing So good I can t think about it Oh my god After I write this review I am going to cook a pound of bacon eat some apple pie which I just brought back from Upstate and and when I m done I ll probably still want to go to Kitchenette Nothing compares Ok Good Enough To Eat compares and is better but this place is really really good They re also different Kitchenette is a little more austere They re in different neighborhoods whatever Anyway everything here has a little delicious hint of grease in it In a good way I get a bacon omelette w extra bacon and a side of bacon No regrets Oh and GUESS WHAT This is really the awesome part they deliver to the Columbia area Pretty far south actually They used to get me on 111th which is awesome given the relative lack of good food options immediately south of Columbia Community being a notable exception it was a godsend I ordered from them dozens of times a year and was always surprising people Friend WAIT THEY DELIVER TO 113st Me Duh Friend WHY HAVE I BEEN ORDERING FROM DELUXE WHYYYYY 
DjIWpN3pfOlXJw858zosWQ CMU The drinks are average food is average great happy hour specials but yes it IS a crowded place and you get to know your seat neighbors business a little more then you would have liked to But if you re into crowds and getting to know more people this is for you The crowd seems to be ALL a collage frat type or a younger crowd so it can get loud but its never a bad experience Just never anything that special either 
DKqSDHSG1gxIBOoupn_Qnw CMU i have visited only once on a saturday late morning but i loved it decor is adorable food is delicious although a bit pricey perusing the egg dishes though they sound delicious and a bit fancier than the usual IHOP selection i decided they were not quite Special enough to entice me when i eat at any breakfast place i want to have something new novel unique impossible for me to make on my own their pancake french toast selection however was everything i could want and more i decided on a cherry vanilla baked french toast and i was amazingly impressed and proceeded to recommend it to a fellow patron in line for a table it was mouth wateringly delicious the endges were crispy the cherry and vanilla along with the french toast batter were a perfect flavour combination best breakfast i have had in quite some time if you have any feelings whatsoever for breakfast starches GO and try their weekend french toasts and as an addendum the french toast i had wins my breakfast of the year award go kitchenette 
DMdK9JquEBgRDw2vGrNUfA CMU The bar is a narrow two floor establishment that s always full of kids from Columbia I m not sure this is a rooftop bar despite being on the top floor of the building Every time I ve been there coincidentally it has been dumping rain snow and I ve never actually seen the windows opened up or the roof retracted if it does retract Also I generally equate being able to smoke as the defining feature of a rooftop bar area Downstairs is another bar and table zone but you can t sit at the tables unless you order food The food served here is usual pub food American bland Salads are slightly wilted but not inedible Guac was kinda watery but again not inedible Buffalo chicken strips spiciness level Inhuman were pretty spicy but soaked in sauce to the point that fork and knife are necessary for consumption But then again I think The Heights tends to be more Bar centric than Grill centric So let s discuss the bar Two words Frozen Margaritas Two more words Happy Hour 2 2 4 Frozen Margarita Happy Hour Trust me I m Asian and therefore good at math And with math like that why would you order anything else After 2 hours of happy hour margaritas 5 for flavored I left 17 tip poorer really not sure how THAT math works out being I definitely ordered drank more than 4 margaritas and none of them were flavored and felt about 80 drunker Later that night at another bar I m pretty sure I publicly humiliated my ex by slapping him in the face and then laughing him into a cab 4 Margaritas x 2 3 That kind of night The trick to curing a brainfreeze is to rub your tongue or the pad on your thumb against the roof of your mouth thereby heating up your frozen brain I swear this works Yes you probably know him and if you re an Asian girl he s probably hit on you on this very website No he does not play ping pong 
DoCLg54ay98EI0jF2U1enw CMU Massively overpriced for small portions of mediocre food You re apparently paying for gingham window hangings I gave them an extra star because their frosted shortbread cookies are really good when fresh and totally addictive but they cost 3 25 For SHORTBREAD AND ICING 
DOYShZXHd5nTq5yW6RedVg CMU I know most freshmen are pretty bitter when it comes to John Jay because it s expensive 11 every meal including those days when you just want fruit yogurt and being in New York there are so many better places to eat right If a meal plan wasn t required John Jay is pretty decent There always is a salad bar which hasn t let me down so far Sure you might get a couple rotten grape tomatoes here and there but everything else is alright There s always a fancy grain like quinoa or wheat berries and everyone likes hummus Coming from another school s dining hall John Jay is pretty decent Although all their rules are a little annoying you only have 15 min to load up a to go box the place runs pretty smoothly most of the time It s too bad that they don t change up the menu more often because a pizza pasta omelette can only be palatable for so long But they always have 3 waffle batters for brunch and soo much cereal The dining hall itself is quite big with its tall ceilings etc It s cute how the dining hall page gives little facts about how cool John Jay For a student this place is alright but I don t know why the public would come here 
dp3V7EFiHRqXZ-0d44--Kg CMU Mixed menu with multi national cuisine usually not a good idea The sushi tasted frozen and the sushi rice was kind of crunchy but not in a good way The sashimi was flavor less The waitress was attentive but not all there we ordered a bottle of sparkling water and she only brought us one glass with it The meal came with small corn bread muffins as the bread supplement which were decent The spicy tuna roll was good if I would ve bought it from Morton Williams I mean All in all it wasn t a horrible experience or anything but compared to other places in the area it was bottom of the barrel Maybe it was just an off night 
Dpnh_66Mo8lzH4CA4uRffg CMU Came here on a Thursday at around 12 30 for lunch for my first and certainly not last dance with African food Upon trying to enter the establishment I soon found out the door was locked I knocked a few times and some guy opened it I think he is the manager host owner waiter chef busboy The genteleman s english wasn t the best but I was able to communicate with him thanks to HS french I order some tap water and of course he brought out a bottle of Poland Spring I was a little ticked off about this but let it slide My friend and I both order the Lamb Mafe it s a peanut based lamb stew over rice Unlike many of the other people who reviewed this place our food came out very promptly we were the only 2 patrons in the establishment which might have something to do with it Anyway the Mafe was quite delish unlike anything I ve every tasted before It reminded me of a mix between an Indian Curry dish and those cold Peanut Noodles that chinese restaurants serve The lamb was tender and well cooked On a 97 degree day eating this food and walking around the city for 5 hours may not have been the best combination but I enjoyed my experience at Kine 
dS5gbRUkLeyFGRO_jzA7Vg CMU I love the food at this place The service here is a joke I honestly thought I was being punk d The guy waiter is always nice and effecient but the female waitresses are HORRIBLE They re slow and have really bad attitudes Last time we walked in the place was almost empty and the two of them just sat there watching TV looking at is like they didn t work there Then when we went to seat ourselves they still didn t get up but instead said that the table we picked was dirty so we should sit somewhere else We ve had bad service here a few times and each time we ve sworn to NEVER return but we really like the food Next time we ll just order and pick it up The chicken brocette with couscous and plantains is great The piosson grill is also great 
DsHz1qcH2anOX0V7V_ik_A CMU I am surprised by the negative reviews I go to the Hall occasionally and have never had anything but a good experience The staff is always friendly the food is solid and fairly priced the surroundings are cozy One Saturday afternoon a friend of mine stopped by about an hour before the kitchen opened we did not know it started dinner at 5pm but they opened up and fed us anyway I have never had a problem with the tab either The beer selection is good of course there can never be enough varieties of beer on tap to make me truly happy and the desserts are yummy I went for dinner one weeknight the week before Christmas and there were several groups in there and everyone seemed be having a good time I would recommend you go and try it out and decide for yourself I however like the place even though it s a bit out of the way for anyone other than a Columbia student or resident of Morningside Heights I kind of suspect that some of the bad comments may be related to the owner s unwillingness to advertise on Yelp it would not be the first time I heard about that 
Dsj4cjDADgLLgdB-VyFlcg CMU I really wanted to like this place and I did at first I have gone here for brunch had dinner delivered and eaten here for dinner twice The food is decent no frills kind of comfort vibe You can get breakfast at night which I like But also kind of bland not very much salt or pepper used in the kitchen I guess The 2 times I ate here for dinner in one week I ordered a side of coleslaw The first time it never came and I never saw our waiter again the whole night different waiter dropped our check The second night I ordered the same side of coleslaw and again it never came Our waiter was so swamped with other tables I could never ask for it The first night no one ever came back to see if we wanted dessert so we closed out our tab and then went to the front counter and got some baked goods to go The second night the waiter was so busy we thought we would do the same thing again OH NO We were rudely told by the hostess that we were supposed to ask our waiter in the dining room to get our baked goods Well seeing as how we had just waited 20 minutes to get our check now we should go back to our table that had since been cleared off and ask the swamped waited to open a new tab for us so he could go and pack up some cookies for us to go I mean seriously some one can walk in off the street and pick out some cupcakes and cookies to go at the front counter but if you just finished a meal there you have to get the waiter to do it What kind of system is this Actually it was just someone who didn t want to do their job and made up some story to brush us off So if you like bland under seasoned food and you like not getting everything that you ordered and you like rude lazy counter service by all means go to Kitchenette Uptown 
du4v2t80S_GKp65hmn8uhg CMU A walk down the mountain of stairs in Morningside Park in Harlem is perhaps one of the most distinct changes in atmosphere possible in Manhattan At the top of the stairs the Ivy League university of Columbia with its proud old buildings and campus courtyards Young people scurrying this way and that or tanning in the lawn Three minutes later at the bottom of the stairs one is thrust into the very different atmosphere of 116th Street a distinctly West African part of New York City The noises are different louder The accents are French and Wolof and Bambara The colors are brighter the clothes flashier and the people more sensual The smells are sweet and spicy and very alluring As the sun was setting to the west over Morningside Park and Columbia University we decided to settle into a popular yet cozy restaurant My apologies for the photos the interiors had almost no light It was not the eyes that were necessary for this wonderful eating experience though And how can you go wrong with an eatery that boasts such amenities like a coat check a carryout window and even a grand ballroom downstairs At Africa Kine Restaurant the focus is on the cuisine of Senegal and is not so aspiring as the name might allude to but that always equates to better food as pan anything restaurants are thoroughly mediocre in everything And let s be honest a menu with all the food of Earth s most diverse continent would be nothing short of insane The women serving us are beautiful and beautifully wardrobed in very bright dresses native to Dakar We have many questions about the food and all are answered with depth and friendliness We are disappointed that the national dish of Thiebu Djen 10 is only available at lunchtime but are more than satisfied with our eventual selections starting with the Poisson grill 11 which was served with an excellent onion relish sauce part mustard and part pepper spices The fish was obviously cared for as every morsel inside was tender and marinated to perfection Our other dish was Dibi 11 grilled lamb also served with the same sauce Unfortunately it turned out too tough and required a lot of jaw work I will look forward to going across the street another day to the Dibiterie Cheikh which sounds more promising in the world of Dibi The dessert menu was less than exciting so we decided to take our search for sweets to the nearby candy stores catering to West African sweet toothes 
DuA-dbDphOvPdKLr6haMVg CMU Obnoxious Refused entry to Guiding Eyes for the Blind service dog in training And were rude about it I won t be back ever 
DVXI1pco72ZgOF7Q2pk4-w CMU Good penne pasta Generally overpriced 10 minimum per person in the restaurant 
DXpAUJjmJ2RiaO5rcyCi4A CMU The city s best chicken and waffles mmmmmmm 
DXpOomAGPAgtOI0JDevaQw CMU Haakons has some good happy hour specials and it s a family run place with a friendly staff I m a fan of some of their home brewed beers which are on tap for happy hour in particular the Haakon s Hall Ale The restaurant is divided into two halves a sports bar atmosphere on one side and the more sirene sit down atmosphere on the other I wish I could comment on the food but I ve only ever had the fries they re great 
DyAafVZLM4rHt2WEP1NQbQ CMU I have ordered from this restaurant for 4 years and have had a few complaints over the years Every complaint one makes is treated with hostility and instead of being apologetic and correcting the mistake they blame the customer A few nights ago I ordered my wings extra crispy super well done The order taker Ruby repeated my exact order back to me but when the wings arrived they were soft and sticky clearly under cooked I put them in stove and cooked them further An hour or so later I ended up vomiting When I called the restaurant Ruby said we thought they would be too dry if we cooked them more They ignore your requests Further my food has arrived at times with staples in it or hair etc I think it is time to say farewell They should appreciate their customers more We are not at fault for requesting that our food is prepared a certain way Isn t that their job 
DYxd73MJ4fVofwwWLhNVpg CMU I am being just a tad facetious However John Jay is a privately operated eating establishment that is open to the public Admission gets entrants seating among a gaggle of Columbia mostly freshmen as well as all you can eat crappy wilted lettuce hit or miss salad bar vegetables depressing looking burgers and food service pizza Most of the entrees tend to be bland and loveless However weekday mornings feature Wilma s delightful omelettes the cranberry muffins are delicious there are lucky charms the bacon s bacon the mac and cheese is surprisingly solid and occasionally the entrees can actually have flavor You probably won t eat here unless you have to or are partaking in some ironic scavenger hunt 
dzQPyo8nNeG-O6fI2Tpn0A CMU Ok Ok I get it If I want to stay elite I have to get back on my review game So I m in NY for a couple of job interviews trying to get back home by any means and my cousin takes me to the Heights to forget about my troubles Now I was taught to drink in the south where you either get a beer or some dark liquor If anyone in the A saw me drinking a margarita they would kill me but I m not in the A so F it I m not going to say what kind I got but getting 2 for 8 dollars in NY definitely put me in a great mood Wings weren t too bad and my waitress wasn t either All in all Great time for a happy hour didn t even know they did that in NY and if I get a chance I wouldn t mind doing the night specials either 
D_bUYpeDKu2MNAn_PIbbfQ CMU Walked into Melba s on a Wednesday night and it was pretty busy Our host let us sit at the bar until a table was available I ordered the salmon with collard greens and macaroni and cheese They asked how Id like the salmon cooked ummm so there s no salmonella I never knew there was an option The portion size was perfect The salon flaky and light I couldnt eaten a vat of the creamy cheesy macaroni The collard greens were interesting never had them before they were kind of bitter but maybe thats how they should taste The service was a tad slow but helpful and friendly Considering how well priced the menu items were most of the drinks on the menu quite expensive 11 for a glass of sangria 
E0xjbFt6HxECo-Xd794LEg CMU I ve been here twice now and was underwhelmed both times The food was just okay and a bit pricey for what you get but what really soured me was the slowness and inattentiveness of the waitstaff Both times I went were early on weekdays when there were only one or two other people there besides my partner and I The first time we waited awhile for anyone to even give us menus and after we ordered it took over 30 minutes for our scrambled eggs to come The second time knowing how slow the service had been the first time we just ordered yogurt and granola because we were in a hurry It took over 25 minutes to get our two cups of yogurt The food is just not special enough to warrant this sort of wait time when the restaurant is nearly empty 
E3c13SOguEuwvDNepbICDA CMU Come for the burgers stay for the outdoor deck 
E3ERwBhKaCWhO9yEK8I4Hw CMU I LOVE KITCHENETTE Really because of the decor Tables are old doors covered with glass top mugs have pink polka dots and the cafe logo chairs also have pink polka dots This is like girly girl heaven Pretty much the only reason I can see for living in NYC would be to go to kitchenette every morning It is just so cute Food is basic diner food as far as I m concerned Not fantastic but good enough Staff is friendly and I m assuming this is not normal for NY and service is quick Check it out 
e617f0KwfnQ-jWewjDwnzQ CMU Food was good solid Typical comfort food that might taste the same as in your home town diner Easy place to sit and chill although I would imagine that brunch here must be crazy but the sweets good lord the sweets are good Big cupcakes stuffed with cream little pecan pies seems seasonal and it feels impossible to leave this place without taking something sweet home you have to walk by it to leave after all 
E6IN72jG6CHL4jx7PalInQ CMU Decent lunch specials The servers are really nice but boy is this place slow For black bean soup and a burrito Granted I really liked the black bean soup But like most food around Columbia it s pretty medicore But it s not a bad bet the burritos quesadillas soups and soups are nothing to write home about but are ok for a relaxing lunch What makes this place worth it is the rooftop for happy hour 
E8J9wHSOixeGdDvXFpb3EA CMU The food is underwhelming but the atmosphere is festive the rooftop and the menu is affordable The service is just ok I hate to admit it but I like the burritos at Chipotle better than at the Heights 
E8OnMBiLG1UBJ3Xz7yIlgQ CMU Super cute place for brunch the tables are made out of old doors I ve eaten here few times and haven t been disappointed The food is tasty and service is good it tends to be pretty crowded and I ve had to wait 30 45 minutes for a table before so be prepared if you re heading here for a weekend brunch 
E9vcWFcUkHf_1kW-sg2QOQ CMU Delivery is going to take at least an hour That being said the food is good but most of the menu is just too overpriced for me to try out Chocolate milkshake at 6 was excellent and twelve chipotle chicken wings for 13 50 were pretty good as well albeit they were small and the sauce was just home made tomato sauce and the wings were baked not fried so they were healthier and easier to digest 
eauH2fZfQgwuqixYfyJ4Zw CMU Where else can you get a full size lunch plate for 6 50 in the area I take every guest I can to this place because it s a wonderful ambiance though a little on the bar side with excellent food for a great price All their lunch plates are 6 50 from opening to 4 pm 
eC90SzQFfh2KKZn8kWYlDQ CMU Nice place upscale for the neighberhood Of course you go there for the fried chicken that Bobby Flay competed again it is good but not amazing the waffles that come with it and the strawberry butter are good but again no big wow we were a big group 12 people and we were suprised that they added a 25 service charge I mean adding service to a group is obvious but 25 come on Most of our group had the fried chicken and waffle a couple of other had a omlet and salad but didn t have any special comments on it If I would live around there i would probably go often for brunch otherwise can t see myself going again 
eCsvas2wAbVlGPQ6JJe2_g CMU This is my go to brunch place in Morningside Heights I love the cheesy grits and the homemade sausage the coffee s good too But pleeeease bring back the old menu I miss the polenta And there hasn t been a waffle special in a while The stuff that s on there now is kind of ordinary 
EdfDPeGILrhm619hwhJ4JA CMU So my friend is in town for a wedding so we stopped in for a quick visit The restaurant was really nice it had a great atmosphere and some nice art on the wall We sat to order and before we knew it 30 minutes had passed and we didn t have our food There was 2 other tables that came in and had their food before us I don t know if they forgot to put in our order or what but we were waiting entirely TOO DAMN LONG We ordered the sweet potato pancakes a side of beef sausage a side of home fries and we had the fish and cheese grits Nothing was piping hot we didn t say anything because we were in a rush and the waiter and waitress were nice but DAMN it took too long The fish was good I don t like cheese grits but my friend enjoyed them The beef sausage was sooo small they looked like little vienna sausages wth The potatoes were really good I think there were sweet potatoes mixed in I am not a fan of the sweet pancakes its just not my thing I guess I think I will go back again and see what happens during dinner but I main problem was the wait time they were not busy when we went so yeah idk But everyone was really nice and pleasant So yeah if they could speed up the service time ill be back 
EDFrkkmJynxL5mNRdzxxcQ CMU I took the A Train all the way to Harlem to seek this place out and I was majorly disappointed The service was super slow and getting a refill of my coke was impossible When I decided to cut my losses and get the heck out of there it took 10 minutes to get the bill I tipped the waiter because he looked like he needed the money but I should have followed my first mind and went to Sylvia s instead Yes they have strawberry butter and egg nog waffles but it s not worth the effort My Mama makes better chicken greens and cornbread 
eDtkp9QK8mcUFcch9YtpQA CMU I was initially very surprised the size of the dining room I had no idea it was that tiny I tried the egg nog waffles and fried chicken Waffles were delish I d definitely go back for more The fried chicken however was much like everyone else said not that good I ordered white meat and the chicken was just too dry and lacked flavor Seriously I have better fried chicken at Kennedy Fried Chicken Our server was great we asked to be moved because the place was so small everytime the door opened we d get the cold draft I tried everyone else s food at my table and it was delish The mac n cheese was fantastic I d def visit again 
efpjWe_u8t5IwCrRnujDbw CMU I loved this tiny little restaurant when I lived uptown and I went there for brunch three times I probably won t go to it very often anymore since it would involve a horrendous weekend subway trek now But it s definitely one of the best neighborhood establishments in Morningside Heights The first time I went I had an egg scramble with spinach gruyere and ham It was really rich even if a bit oily My one complaint was their homemade English muffin it was really bland tasteless and dry though the pumpkin butter they served it with was divine As were the red potatoes on the side My second try was probably my favorite at all I ordered the black cherry pancakes and OMG They are definitely near the top of the list of Restaurant Foods I Will Deeply Miss Now that I am Doomed to Gluten Free They were sweet and savory and paired with some orange marmalade and apple butter if I remember correctly I was so happy The last time I tried the turkey and chipotle hash which was a bit different than I d been expecting imagine chunks of turkey more like brisket than poultry in the way they re cooked It was exactly what I needed to clear my sinuses I had a cold without any worry of killing myself further with cheese That meal included a biscuit and it was somehow much much better I do remember my partner being a little disappointed about one meal she got though the French toast is NOT what you would imagine French toast to be It s a giant wedge of a very heavy homemade cinnamon bread type dessert She thought it was a little dry even with the syrup and wasn t satisfied that particular morning with eating dessert for breakfast probably because it just hadn t been her intention Beware brunch is always packed I ve waited anywhere from 0 to 40 minutes the former at 11am on a Sunday the latter at 1pm on a Sunday 
egKGK0P4qEGrYO7F7AyWtg CMU Strawberry Raspberry Peach Passion Fruit and Banana margaritas either frozen or on the rocks in a 10 oz glass for 5 during happy hour If you are still reading this review then you must not have understood what I just wrote This place has some of the best margaritas I have ever had They have all of the above flavors and you can even mix and match I order a strawberry banana margarita it is delicious They have a nice rooftop where you can enjoy these cheap margaritas Service is pretty good It can get packed so expect a little bit of a wait during happy hour The food is nothing spectacular but all you need is great drinks with a not so good meal 
EGkon298vBm6e2c_N2VWuA CMU Okay I ve been to Kitchenette 3 times and don t think I will be back again My first and last experiences were awful The food didn t taste good and I was not happy The first time I went I got the fried chicken and mash potato the chicken was cold and the mash potatoes were the worst I d had in my life The second time I went was for breakfast and I got an omlette it was actually pretty good and I figured my first experience was just a bad day in the kitchen The third time I went I got soup and the roast beef sandwich Let s just say when I got home I threw up I don t know what they put in the sandwich but I knew upon eating it that it tasted funky I m sorry but I won t be giving Kitchenette a fourth try 
EGPpPN9kveXnrnF74N2dyw CMU Although a little pricey the food is plentiful and top quality Don t get stuck ordering something that you always order Take a quick peak at other peoples food and try something new Tip If faced with the choice of Bacon or Sausage take the bacon and leave the sausage alone 
EIPpA5pnCZh_3HFMx5FanA CMU This seems to be my go to place in the neighborhood when I can t decide where to go It s one of the few places I ve found where I can sit alone at the bar and not feel awkward that I m sitting alone The staff is friendly although can be a bit laid back which only means let them know if you re in a hurry The yum Fried half chicken the Tofu appetizer any chops yum and always take a look at the specials It s always tasty for brunch too the southern french toast rolled in corn flakes for an added crunch and served with strawberry butter Thursday nights they often have live jazz to boot 
eJ6LEQ8wM54D_g4q-9WPUQ CMU I felt a little bad that almost everyone in my group ordered the chicken waffles The waitress very nicely tried to tell us that there were a lot of other delicious options And there were some intriguing items on the menu But I d imagine most people and almost every first timer will go for that distinctive combo Oh well It really did the trick to fill me up for a late dinner Very tasty savory chicken and beer if you so desire with plenty of sweet flavors eggnog waffles maple syrup strawberry butter Not the best I ve had but worth the trip uptown 
ekKneAqMjBuePTKD-myTEw CMU Went to The Heights last weekend with a couple of friends We sat at the rooftop We were probably too drunk to judge the place but the weather was perfect and the music was great Drinks were reasonable and there was enough space for us to dance So all in all I think this place is great and most definitely going back D 
ekUM4TtQWoZHh20UTv1F_w CMU One of the few classic Columbia student hangouts now that the West End has been grotesquely transformed Generally very cramped as part of the bar scene but a great place to begin at the start of a thursday or friday night bar hopping adventure 
El87RIzP7WU8YBZKNfRojg CMU Great location for any Columbia student outdoor seating in season My menu did not look anything like what is on the website In fact I did not even realize it was a Norwegian restaurant if I had I would have tried something besides a burger It was good Probably worth a trip back 
eLKYtHpiVjaDzOTl825kwg CMU Wanted to come for Harlem RW but caved and got some dinner takeout instead Called in and picked up an order no desserts though Really now I know I should be happy but I m not Ambiance service I m sure Food Network helped the business out though I didn t get the chickeneggnogwaffleswithstrawberrybutter The interior was different than I d expected but nice the music was too capricious even in the 5 minutes I was there The guy who greeted me at the bar was clearly ripped and brought out a bag with one item inside and asked if it was OK they didn t have a fork to go in said bag I said it was fine but made sure both of my items were inside they weren t good thing I asked When he returned within 20 seconds crab cakes and a fork spoon napkin packet both magically placed themselves in plastic and materialized in my bag Food The cheesy grits with which I don t have much experience were merely cheese holding together grits at the bottom That s not to say they weren t good they were damn good The crab cakes were enormous and incredible as was the dipping sauce The bed of greens on which they sat was also good an aspect of a dish some places often overlook when it comes to appetizers The mac cheese was a bit dry but still very very tasty and the pecan crusted tilapia was full of flavor though the pecans must ve escaped my tray before I got to them Overall it was expensive but definitely a lot of really good food 
eLM1-d6pPZj3oz7aPCQwbA CMU My friend and I came here to grab some drinks The entrance is pretty obscure and you can easily miss it It place is located upstairs with tiny signs There were many college students here and a good amount of women The service was fast and our bartender was nice He kept the drinks coming however it s pretty pricey here The atmosphere was decent and you can get a great view if you sit near the window We opted for the bar so we can have our drinks quickly delivered 
elW3hb45mWC3tl9dUn6Jrg CMU Melba s restaurant apparently is a new restaurant owned by the daughter of the famed Soul Food restaurant Sylvia s Melba then does a great job at puttin the family foot deeper into the pot that marinates the soul food we all love Furthermore i really enjoyed Melba s we found it using an app on my iphone after another Harlem soul food restaurant told my gf that she could come in the next day but failed to mention that they were closing the restaurant that very night for a private party idiots The catfish was delightful and the service was fast attentive and friendly THe night we went a gentleman was performing and he was just the right combination of talent humor and coolness sounds like i m describing myself lol The ambiance was sexy and romantic with large mirrors candlelight and an attractive bar My only apprehension was the space but whats a soul foods spot without a little intimacy I ve only been here once but i definitely think its worth checking out FIRST YELP REVIEW YAYYYY 
ElyvAIb31nX0WNoGRoA1GQ CMU Yummy brunch hang over place Super crowded on Sunday morning so it was kind of an unpleasant atmosphere 
EN4emtIEraE-j2mRbN4fcQ CMU I went here this past weekend with Kailee P She pretty much summed up our experience I like the decor and the waiters were nice one was training first day on the job We were there for about an hour and a half I honestly think they forgot our order What bugs me is that if you did just admit it instead of continuously saying it ll be out in a minute The food wasn t hot at all The sweet potato pancakes were quite mushy The fish and grits were good but again the food was cold 
ENb1XRlg82JUEyOXZLnRHQ CMU Went here for the first time 8 21 11 Good food good prices and good service but rude management A friend unexpectedly called and asked to join us at Kitchenette shortly after our party had been seated I understand that it can be inconvenient for a restaurant to seat an extra person after the main party has already been seated and we were grateful that Kitchenette bent the rules to allow our friend to join us However we did not appreciate the lengthy condescending lecture about Kitchenette s seating policies which the manager dropped by to deliver in the middle of our meal I liked this restaurant but don t think I will return as there are a number of nicer proprietors in the neighborhood who I d rather support 
enp804zERYywgYnAzX9lnA CMU The space is small but intimate Great service the soul food is so comforting Some nights there live music The plating is nice everything I ve tried is so flavorful Love esp the Honey chicken the cod The cocktails are delish you must have their warm red velvet cake a la mode To die for 
EoIYtiomLml2-UNc5YKY8w CMU Dying for wings didn t feel like leaving the neighborhood Came here because it was open on Sunday night Every beer I tried to order was out of stock and the wings were dry with virtually no sauce to speak of Less than a buck a wing which would be good if they hadn t cooked them to death In reality I can t think of any circumstances under which I would come back here 
EPB6fUE0gWTBAXYXybUWQQ CMU Really cute but cramped Very limited tables but a decent number of counter seats I came for brunch The grits were too dry which was really disappointing because I love grits and was really in need of some good grits the search continues Bacon nice crispy thick slices Butter some magical delicious butter could be apple butter I was too busy enjoying it to ask Eggs good it s hard to mess up eggs Pancakes nice and wheaty it was fluffy but also had some grit to it possibly buck wheat Coffee potent but not gross i e gooooooood Price 10 
EpobWuoCtbqKPvqp0pvtCg CMU Came here last night under the delusion that I could out drink some army rangers I cannot This is one of the easy access bars near school where my friends and I often go after being mind effed by teachers all day It s a very chill restaurant bar that also serves interesting food along with classic pub grub One of the owners was working behind the bar last night and he was doing a good job making sure everyone was having a good time 4 drafts are available but the drink of choice for last night was the Haakon Special a black and tan with a shot of whiskey Always a good time 
eQf4XaHl64g78ucxEx6qnA CMU I really wanted to love this place but I don t However I ll still give it three stars and here s why Pros 1 Tasty cocktails 2 Great service Melba is quite nice 3 Great location if you live in Harlem Cons The food The food is just average For being a soul food restaurant in Harlem I was expecting a lot more Amy Ruth s 116th Lenox and Rack and Soul 109 Broadway are much better I love fried chicken and those dirty take out places with bullet proof windows probably serve up better fried chicken 
EQwZBE-SKIno3VOccFGlSQ CMU My boyfriend and I had been meaning to make the trek up to Harlem to try Melba s for a few months yeah yeah ever since we saw the Throw Down episode Anyway we finally made that highly awaited journey last night in the middle of the rain storm The first thing I thought when we sat down was that the restaurant was very pretty NYC is filled with trendy quaint cozy hip cute etc places but this one was simply pretty Dark somewhat romantic lighting It was nice We split the chicken and waffles dish of course with a side of the tres mac and cheese accompanied by the passion cosmo good but something anyone could make and we finished with the red velvet cake a la mode choosing the vanilla ice cream over chocolate so that the cake shined We opted for white meat and next time because there will definitely be a next time we ll go with dark meat The meat was moist not the moistest I have ever had but certainly cooked well and moist enough The skin was lightly seasoned and had a great crisp just as fried chicken should The eggnog waffles were very well done Moist and fluffy with a light crunch on the outside I didn t think the flavor of eggnog was extremely noticeable maybe it s just been too long since Christmas but the waffles certainly had a unique and tasty flavor The sweet strawberry butter added a touch of fruitiness but it didn t have a strong strawberry flavor so I don t think I would have really missed it had it not been used but I definitely did not dislike it by any means They don t use real maple syrup which can be a huge disappointment for some but regardless the chicken and waffle combination was still great Sweet and savory Definitely worth the trek The Tres mac and cheese was good not amazing but good It lacked the breadcrumb crunch that I have come to expect with every mac and cheese but the cheesy combination was flavorful without being extremely bold Worth having I ve come to be a bit of a red velvet snob after a lengthy quest for the best red velvet cake The cake at Melba s was dense almost the texture of a pound cake I m used to a fluffier texture but I didn t mind the denseness The flavor was acceptable but not amazing There wasn t enough cream cheese on the slice for my liking but it had a hint of citrus which was unique All in all a fine slice of red velvet cake but if you want the BEST red velvet cake go to Cake Man Raven in Brooklyn that s where it s at We ll be back Melba Next time I ll try the southern inspired egg rolls They sounded very intriguing I d also like to go for brunch one day the chicken and waffles dish would be great for a late brunch 
eRM8SsGB4GuGTX3_3okcNw CMU I had my first dinner at NYC here It s a quite place to enjoy a peaceful night 
ESs6Zh30l19r8H_G0jNuLw CMU I was so surprised to find there was a place with an open rooftop in this area Really comfortable location with a bar up there too They have delicious and strong martinis for just 5 You have tons of options for flavors too I got the strawberry mango and had no regrets I will definitely try their other flavors next time They also have surprisingly good salsa and chips for just 3 Perfect combo with the martini Grab a friend chat and enjoy the view and fresh air up there 
eS_BHWgAY7EgBaT-i71Jaw CMU Kitchenette is a cute albeit constantly cluttered upper west side charmer The place kind of presents itself as a French caf but is a pinker more feminine and kitschy version of this The surprise factor is the place is crammed for weekend brunch so much that you don t really feel the option of lingering and taking it in The food is solid Fresh and light French toast Breakfast staples eggs yummy maple butter grits you are near Harlem and other home style staples I like the touch of the mason jars though getting them filled can be a bit tricky at times My favorite touch was like Ted Allen of Top Chef Chopped and his fascination with tableside presentation yes you ve seen it I love the fact that the menu has a restaurant mission statement on it explaining their roots and food approach Overally Kitchenette basically breaks down to if you can handle the wait The food and prices are fair and it seems the nearby radius is a bit short of places Worth a venture just sneak in early or sloth in late 
eUe7wC-5G07GHN47vvvuog CMU Came here for dessert and we got to meet Melba the restaurant owner that has been featured on the Food Network She was very friendly and seemed passionate about her business and took the time to chat with us after we finished our dessert I ordered the red velvet cake and my friend ordered the sweet potato pie Must say I loved the sweet potato pie and I wish I had ordered the pie instead of the cake The red velvet cake was not bad but it just was not very sweet The desserts are homemade and both desserts came out warm Overall it was a fun place to grab desserts and would definitely return to actually try the food or have drinks with friends The atmosphere is very warm and cozy and its a nice space to relax and have a comfortable meal Good experience but I would just order something different the next time I return 
EWEByLL_Nj1qD6LG2H62Rw CMU It s good just don t get the Johny boy Other wise it s good and I would order from there again 
EwFgFwHiGS4p1TL0-iymKA CMU Really a great little shop Good variety on the menu breakfast served until 4 p m Amazing burgers salads and other items huge ice cream selection and amazing looking cupcakes How I wanted to be bad Staff are attentive and the space is really cute Decent pricepoints Good food I will be back 
ewvhGd1Jiy_IyTWtLlRWfw CMU I d like to be able to rate this restaurant but they wont deliver to me They are located on 123rd and Amsterdam They ll deliver all the way south to 96th street and north to 138th on the west side This means that they will deliver all the way to 138th and Riverside but not to 139th and Amsterdam where I am I am actually 1 5th of a mile closer to them than 138th and riverside but alas I m a block north of their limit The girl on the phone was ok about it and she asked the manager but obviously nobody there was actually thinking about the reason behind the rule namely saving time and or gas instead they were just blindly following it I offered to pay a small extra fee but no dice It s a shame because those of use in Hamilton Heights need some decent delivery and this place looks great 
Exlo051Dvs4cW-r9usnvgg CMU 
Ez5wpyRECfSEpjy5srySgg CMU I generally like The Heights but I have a few complaints 1 The service at the bar is generally poor There is one waitress who ignores me 2 Late at night the bouncerette cards me every time even though I frequent the place and looks as though she doesn t really believe that my ID is legit 3 The wings are bad The good 1 Massive burritos 2 Excellent salads 3 Happy hour frozen margaritas 4 Most food options are pretty good Also prices are about what you might expect for a place like this Shouldn t cost more than 15 20 per person unless you re drinking a lot or buying for someone else The seating on the top level is very pleasant on a nice day or evening The waiters are also friendly 
EZOOk-BUCxJ9SDI25150tg CMU So delicious Went here for lunch recently with my work and the wait wasn t bad for a larger group Service was decent but the food was definitely stand out They accidentally put bacon on my vegetarian coworkers salad but they took care of the problem immediately and got her a brand new salad Pasta salad was awesome with fresh dill Only thing that bummed me out was they don t have fountain soda cans Meh I ve also catered from here amazing baked goods a little pricey but delicious Very prompt with delivery and invoices The ladies were very easy to work with in placing my order 
E_JWi93ayOaAq0qPBEaeZw CMU I can t wait to come back to this place Food is really good I had the Salmon Mac n Chesse and Collard Greens Reminds me of real southern food 
F4gGCrU1n6LmALD_uMjksg CMU Margaritas That s all you need to know about this place There is food and it s alright but really it s all about the Margaritas They are big cheap strong and good I only get a second one if I am planning on a hangover the next day Also the roof part is awesome and if you are there early enough it is a nice low key place for a drink 
F8hxD7GHbTvYacEKkbiH2A CMU I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup she had the Norwegian meat patties The food was delicious and we had a great time I will return again 
f9G95ypVYPX6Lmw2bgizGA CMU i wasn t expecting such a shiny establishment for chicken and waffles i m used to the greasy spoon dive to get my southern breakie helpings so my old roomie pointed me towards the spot because it was featured on food network once you sit down homemade biscuits are quickly served they have a nice sweetness to the crust moist and not to crumbly i just wish they were bigger i went straight with the egg nog waffles and fried chicken let s just say i devoured it the waffles reminded me of the crisp exterior and moist insides of a bioche the chicken also was good though i wish they were legs for easier eating you do have the choice of white or dark meat which is nice if you aren t a glutton like i am i recommend the smoothered chicken the gravy is nice and home fries are a nice side home fries include sweet potato goodness as well 
fafcIIkhQAwa3Dw6LAZpKA CMU The food was good A LOT OF FOOD But the service is slow and inattentive but I think i kind of expected that 
fC3gnh1wi-dLd7w1k-Y2Yw CMU Food Good food for a good price Had wings and mini burgers for appetizers Mini burgers were great Wings were flavored great but were dry and very small For an entree I had the salmon and it was delicious as were the onion rings and smashed potatoes Ice Cream was okay more icy than creamy and a very small portion Service Excellent 
ff0j9E5L5FibGND_6hiBvg CMU I love this place I m currently a Columbia undergrad and therefore don t get to visit here very often you know college student on a budget When I m in the mood for some really good breakfast food though I definitely take a trip to Kitchenette The food tastes great and it s the only spot around where I ve been able to get some REAL bacon you know those nice thick slices But seriously everything about their food is amazing Go 
Fg0KH-Pri8OHoX2_vIiuWw CMU I ve been here several times and it s mostly terrible When I sit at the bar downstairs the service is above average However most people go here for the rooftop deck They only have like 6 seats for people who just want drinks which is just crazy SO you have to order food if you come with a few friends and want to sit on the rooftop The food just bad dried up hot wings a pile of crusty old nachos and the shrimp quesadilla should be renamed to slimy onion quesadilla The server was nice but she seemed to have been assigned ALL of the tables so the service was super slow When we got our beers 20 minutes after arriving they were lukewarm and my boyfriend noted something floating in my glass ew Don t go here 
fGi91Oot1CujipSV4W2j3g CMU The range of the menu made me uneasy when checking it through CampusFood com for their Wednesday special Weak slim Ethiopian and there s an ethiopian spot on the next corner for vegetarians kinda overpriced boring alternatives standard dishes but good enough service over the phone and in the restaurant to warrant an OK review Takeout was an interesting experience arrived and the only guy working and in the place as it was completely empty and creepily dark asked if he had my order right A bit late IMO I was there 5 minutes after the ETA I received and the food had apparently been sitting lonelily on the counter as it was tepid already Apparently their special not a discounted item voided the 10 student discount but life goes on Giving an extra star because they mean well the food was surprisingly spectacular lentil sambusas orange caramel crepe and we don t need any more turnover in the area 
FhFZcwZGm06r9YAAogf7_w CMU Ok so our whole goal Upper West Side drinks and sitting outside It was a beautiful night last night and the PERFECT nyc weather to enjoy a cocktail outside After a hot minute of research two locations became options and once we got to the uws we decided to try The Heights out as a rooftop bar just seemed the ticket We were spot on We didn t make either happy hour 4 7 or 11 close but still got huge margaritas for only 7 During happy hour they are only 4 This now gives us an excuse to return at a later hour I recommend trying the mango margarita if you want to try something a little different Delicious Also if you are hungry the food is pretty good too I had the funguy wich portobello red peppers goat cheese and a basil puree on crusty bread which was delish It was rather rich though and large portions so unfortunately half of it went in the garbage I suggest splitting unless you are a man or REALLY hungry Check The Heights out 
fmvkq7AYEAZ_YBJpiITFTg CMU The rooftop is nice but closes early Unless you get there right after work prepare to be booted downstairs halfway through your hanging out The non rooftop spaces are cramped so once the rooftop is done so is this bar The stairs are steep and narrow Watch yourself on the way out D Margarita specials frozen only on Thursdays Any flavor you want I m more of a fan of on the rocks but hey margarita special Beer selection is small but good Full bar Bartender was friendly 
fOVwskJsWnA02WvolngGBw CMU Went here on a whim place was veryyy small a little too dark Had the potential to be intimate except it was so loud The tables are so close together that the waitstaff walked sideways We had a really nice waitor and the host was friendly too I was not thrilled with my southern fried chicken could def have used more seasoning However the 3 cheese baked macaroni was delish Oh and I would stay away from the candied yams too but hey that s me lol On a positive note my drink was veryyy strong and the bathroom was super clean 
FT2ThaPNNAMSjrS2snyF5Q CMU I dined proper at this small cozy restaurant on New Year s Eve after having its desserts on two separate occasions previously Its red velvet cupcakes were surprisingly good This place is more known for its brunches than its desserts and so I was really surprised that they made really good red velvet cupcakes These cupcakes could rival Crumbs ones 4 stars On NYE I had its Kitchenette Specialty which comprised two large turkey meatloaves and mash potato with gravy Everything was good but not extremely delicious and definitely not special as touted by its name The portion was just right However given its location I think its menu is slightly overpriced Remember to take cash out beforehand as you get 10 off by paying the entire bill in cash 
FuKaXn7cmagOKfW5pKJ9ig CMU Eggnog waffles were rock solid but the fried chicken was a little weak It would have been nice to have a juicier piece of chicken We also had the spinach omelet with home fries The omelet had plenty of well cooked greens and the home fries were well seasoned The lone biscuit between our order and the delivery of the meal 25 minutes later was boring The packaged butter and cheap jam didn t help either Great concept but missed on little nevertheless important details 
FWpEpg6C37TSZ9Urq3ivxA CMU food is decent catfish is great mac and cheese is great service is great The Atmosphere Is Sexy Fun Its a great Alternative to a lounge Can get a little pricey 
fXpL4PVth3yiw806HX70Jw CMU Nice location north of Columbia University and Teachers College Has an open seating area and on a warm Indian summer day the cool breezes blowing through the restaurant gave it a fantastic feel The pizza here is a ok The crust is probably the best part chewy and foldable New York style The only drawback of the this place is that the pizzas aren t made to order You can choose from about 10 different pies and they are all the same size For a pizza lover this is incredibly limiting But if you re a student or instructor in the neighborhood Kitchenette isn t a bad place to spend a meal 
fy8bCQncUXToShpfZzYi3Q CMU I consider this an iconic CU locale and I am more infatuated with The Heights than I am with that boy in my SIPA class I highly recommend the burrito or the burger And stick with beer 
FYBT_StLf7oN_dCNR0nDrA CMU The tale of the Maragarita Happy Hour Challenge 25 minutes and counting til happy hour commenced my neighbor and I took it upon ourselves to take full advantage of the margarita special The clock was ticking and our waiter stopped by She asked what can I get you and we responded 2 frozen STAT An 8 oz frozen maragarita hah Please you are just asking to be taken advantage of Next thing I knew we had finished four a nacho plate and some popcorn shrimp and I don t remember how we got down those steep ass stairs without breaking my neck Ah well the roof was open and sunshine makes everything seem that much better Where did my money go 
FyDmY2gq8Dg4zRG-YJNmJA CMU I m really a fan of the aesthetic here It s such an adorable space Every little detail of design really makes me want to come back here Even though it is horribly crowded for weekend brunch Brunch is marvelous if you don t get what I had Morgan had the French Toast and it was delectable I feel like Abby had a special they were offering just for that day Ginger Pancakes maybe I had the not so tasty cheese blintzes And forgive me for saying this but I ll stick to the ones they make at IHOP These were lacking in texture and taste And the cheesy feeling made my tummy a bit uneasy Such a shame Dinner is a different story or perhaps visiting time is a different story When you show up on a cold as hell night starving and your friend is the only waiter well a little bit of extra love goes into everything The Macaroni Cheese is fantastic and very Uptown with its white cheese and large noodles The seasonal vegetables are cooked and well seasoned And when you re the only people in the restaurant good service is guaranteed In conclusion This place is poppin on weekends so they must be doing something right but if you want the best Kitchenette Uptown has to give go during off peak hours 
g7FuMIAAcQl8h-vwnBcLfg CMU New York is a brunch town Want to catch up with someone on the weekend but have plans at night Brunch Looking for a weekend meal with your girlfriend boyfriend Brunch Did you stay in last night 10 am brunch Did you go out last night 2 pm brunch Can t function without that buzz Boozy brunch With brunch in such high demand it s unsurprising that you can hardly walk two blocks without passing by a place that offers it A Yelp search for brunch in Manhattan yields 2 324 results Compare that to 1 542 for Starbucks What makes reviewing a brunch place even more interesting is that while some use gimmicks you re on notice Cafe Lalo with your completely unimpressive steamed eggs they all offer similar dishes none of which are terribly difficult to make but are hard to distinguish between In the area I can walk up Broadway from 96th and eat at Picnic Cafe du Soleil Cafe du Monde and Community Food and Juice to name a few and have more or less an identical meal Since Yelp reviews are to some extent relative if most brunch places are the same and fine those should receive 3 stars then what does it take to stand out from the pack Enter Kitchenette Unlike some brunch spots which are sceney and hip Kitchenette lacks an air of pretentiousness It s a little kitschy hahahah no with its pink black and white decor and drinks served in mason jars but that only reinforces the atmosphere the restaurant is aiming for an old style Southern influenced diner like the ones that used to exist in the 1950s This attitude is also reflected in the food which is delicious and without frills The presentation and ingredients aren t anything fancy you won t find truffle salt or organically grown wild salmon here but the food is always warm and comforting and has a certain depth that sets Kitchenette apart from a typical diner Pancakes eggs french toast oatmeal sausage you name it Kitchenette s got it The pancakes are made with a four grain batter I would have guessed buckwheat that is richer than anything you ll have at most places It also absorbs syrup like there s no tomorrow but I m okay with that syrup s kind of like sauce right Served alongside the pancakes and french toast is often a special topping usually an apple butter I ve also had pineapple and strawberry that s fantastic and I always use far too quickly Their turkey sausage is a nice change of pace so I can feel less guilty by having one part of my meal that s relatively more healthy and is flavorful but from time to time is a little on the dry side The biscuits are a nice touch too flaky and buttery without containing lard They also serve grits a welcome sight at any diner Out of the 2 324 bruncheries brunch eateries Can I make up a word Thanks in Manhattan how many do you think have that on the menu If you re feeling indecisive like I often am when presented with so many good options I d recommend the Lumberjack I usually order it and I m okay which is two pancakes two eggs and either bacon or sausage It s a happy brunch plate While Kitchenette is mostly thought of a brunch place they also do lunch or dinner Although I ve never been for dinner the couple times I ve dropped in for lunch have always impressed me usually with a half sandwich and soup combo that is just as comforting as the brunch options The other item that sets Kitchenette apart are its baked goods It can be easy to forget about these since the seating area is around the corner and when you pass them by on your way out you re usually too full to give them consideration but the display cases are always stocked with an extensive number of cakes tarts cupcakes and other pastries I ve tried their poppy seed cake banana cream cake and coconut macaroon and they re all very good Last time I was there my friend picked up a box of red velvet cupcakes which are made with real cream cheese frosting It just occurred to me that I ve been looking for a good pastry bakery in my neighborhood there aren t that many good places to stop in and get a slice of cake or pie but I think I ve found it I wish the food were a little cheaper in my head brunch should be cheaper than lunch or dinner but compared with the prices at any of the other brunch places I mentioned above those at Kitchenette are generally a couple dollars lower and the food is a notch or two higher It s definitely my favorite brunchery in the city 
g9vDT2C30OtiNqSsqMhuag CMU This great place has been around the corner unbeknownst to us for way too long I love to grab a good cheap burger beer on a late weeknight and we finally had a chance to go there with a group for brunch and everybody liked it Nice sized portions won t leave you thanksgiving stuffed but you can definitely skip a meal after going there Prices are very reasonable and the service has always been great There are a ton of choices for all types of appetites and the crepes are a great way to start the day or end the night 
GbGhcbVdvuDq_cYIYpDUsg CMU I ve gone here several times and it s always so crowded that I refuse to wait 45 60 minutes for a table It seems like a great spot for folks who get there early enough and stay through after work drinks dinner and dessert I ll review it again when I actually can eat at Melba s 
GczHUdavd0a6Nt12FBXSAg CMU Mediocre and overpriced Everything is just okay at best If you have no other options and you don t want to cook I guess you could head here Dinner is about the same Dessert is your best option But there are far better options in the neighborhood And the neighborhood doesn t have great options 
Ge7ihiU1SW1P7eqiOy5AhQ CMU I have had great Ethiopian food but NOT HERE The injera wasn t very good at all The beef watt dish I had was okay I saw a sign that said All Ethiopian dishes 10 but of course the Ethiopian dish I ordered wasn t part of that deal Even I didn t feel so screwed over by that I wouldn t go back because the food isn t good enough especially for the cost IT S NOT WORTH TRYING 
ggB36hkOJywBRZV9mmm4vw CMU Took my mom here for dinner and loved it Highly recommended Recommendations Food I got the Kjoh Akaker norwegin style meat patty simmered in red wine and aromatic veggies absolutely delicious for 12 50 TOTALLY WORTH IT GET THIS I also tried the French Onion Soup 4 50 and it was really tasty as well My mom tried some sort of fish assortment and we were pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of the seafood Although I thought the white fish tasted the best Ambiance and Service Festive homey and contemporary if you can imagine those 3 adjectives together Marco our waiter was very kind and frequently checked with us for our needs Great place to take friends visiting the Columbia area 
gjUkrv1viIPhgl7yC4lqgg CMU Be prepared to wait if you go for weekend brunch because a lot of New Yorkers have discovered this awesome quirky restaurant waaay uptown I can t speak to their lunch dinner offerings but their brunches are delicious This is not the place for an intimate conversation as the tables are jam packed together and your table will likely be only an inch or two from your neighbors But the servers manage to get through the scrum pretty deftly and my food has alway arrived promptly and piping hot I highly recommend this great brunch spot 
Gkd72TbdkaKJ0bM2UdquyQ CMU i ate chicken and waffles it was pretty damm delicious but it only filled up a quarter of my stomach because you only get two little pieces of a small chicken and half of waffles i would definitely go there again though when im BALLIN Melba is pretty coool the place was pretty cozy and nice and definitely gives a you a southern family feel It is a nice place to take your significant other out they will definitely enjoy it but be prepared to order for 4 
glytFhasPMw54a5llbBKgA CMU Melba s was OK I was freezing so immediately ordered the hot chocolate except it wasn t hot I split a spinach and mozz omelet and cinnamon raisin french toast with a friend The omelet didn t have a lot of taste the home fries that came with them were way over salted and didn t have a great texture The french toast was the best part expect it was a little extra soggy in the middle It was an OK brunch but I would not go back nor recommend it to anyone Also there was a faint smell of cigarette smoke which totally turned me off 
GMN7kO9X_Z5HQ-w6gO8pIw CMU People that I know LOVE kitchenette and I just don t get it The food is okay It s not really my cup of tea I love southern food but it doesn t seem all that southern to me I think it s overrated 
gQiHy8QJpdAxTtohNps2Pw CMU Simply the best Chicken and Waffles on the planet WOW We waited about 35 minutes for a table and it was well worth it Place fills up very quickly on weekends So many great juicy soul food options to choose from on the menu Full service bar and yes every bar seat is taken as well Tables are a bit too close to each other but you don t blame them for trying to maximize the space Service is efficient Can t wait to return for some more mac n cheese 
GqLu04_6AvnkNOkk2Vir7g CMU So we were really excited about this place thinking we d found a great breakfast place according to many reviews we d read here and other places We took my Mom in Law there for breakfast on a Wednesday We got there around an hour after they d opened We were one of three tables in the place and it took a really long time for the guy to take our order and to bring us coffee I ordered the Farmer Jane cause I couldn t decide it had eggs and french toast and bacon KF ordered the Farmer John same but with pancakes and my MIL ordered eggs and potatoes She bases a good place on the potatoes and she didn t like them My french toast was burnt on one side or as nearly burnt as it can be before it goes black I ended up cutting off the bottom of the toast so I could eat the top 1 3 of the bread There was a lot of food but since it failed the french toast and the potatoes test we won t need to go again To top it off we got pastries on the way out for later and my hostess cupcake wannabe and my MIL s brownie were both dry KF got a lemon bar which he said was a bit on the sweet side but at least it wasn t dry All in all a big disappointment 
GTuJGPpUM78BckroHrUq_Q CMU Pros this is what keeps them from 1 measly little star 1 They have a rooftop bar And happy hour has 4 frozen ritas 2 My dining companions enjoyed their entrees NB They all got sandwiches 3 The fries are pretty great 4 Service is prompt and friendly 5 The price is AWESOME Cons Disclaimer I just moved to nyc from Austin where the streets are paved with nachos and the rivers run with margarita 1 The aforementioned frozen margaritas are kinda icky They aren t the super delectable treats I have grown to love That having been said I gulped down the whole thing because there is nothing quite as refreshing as an alcoholic slushie and 4 is a price that can t be beat 2 DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ORDER THE NACHOS As I said above my friends enjoyed their sandwiches and the fries which I sampled amply were delish However I m pretty sure that I figured out the recipe for these nachos Step 1 Go to Wal Mart and get a huge sack of the cheapest tortilla chips money can buy Leave them in the sun to grow stale Step 2 Take some of the chips from Step 1 and spoon black beans over them Spoon directly from the can Do not add spice Do not add salt Do not even drain the gross can bean liquid Just spoon Step 3 Add cheap cheese and not enough of it Step 4 Add tomato sauce Not yummy spicy salsa just chunks from a can of pureed diced chunky tomatoes Step 5 Add shredded carrots Seriously I don t even know what to think about this SHREDDED CARROTS Where did that come from Yes the nachos come with sour cream jalapenos and guacamole But who cares after steps 1 5 I left still hungry with 2 3 of my nachos still on my plate because I just couldn t force them down I had my husband s fries for dinner Bad news However I will probably be back But I will order a sandwich and leave my high expectations for margaritas at home 
GvKautO_IfnA8cIPIJ8yRw CMU Absolutely delicious A must try Best Southern cuisine in Manhattan I m new to the West Harlem area was nervous about the of good restaurants to be found Then I found Melba s am now so happy to be living only a few blocks away The food ambiance is fantastic The staff service excellent Melba herself is often there eager to chat A down home welcoming must try 
gXldI4pVFIc85D_RQqVC-Q CMU Ok fair warning 5 stars may be hasty because 1 I was very hungry and 2 I don t have other soul food restaurants to compare it too With that said I loved it The food was delicious the atmosphere very hip without making me feel out of place Everyone was friendly including other customers The servers really went out of their way to please and it made a difference This was my first time but I definitely plan on coming back Thank you Melba s 
GYhGE1b8pusU9q5z3TvRJw CMU The days are shorter the nights are longer the clothes are being piled on for warmth you re staying home more often because going out is becoming a hassle with the weather a little cooler than you d like You re a busy student and maybe you re missing home cooking You re a Columbia employee and are tired of having a sandwich for lunch Well look no further than Haakon s Hall A restaurant bar that focuses on comfort food with a Norweigan twist They even sell products for you Scandanavians This restaurant is a full service establishment you can come by for a bite or you can stop in to learn to cook offering such classes as Dorm Cooking 101 Gluten Free Cuisine and my favorite All American TV Dinners Go here I like them and would like to see them thrive 
GZeBcb2kQfTlE_yFAzMHyA CMU A staple brunch place for most students here Most things on the menu seem taste great all have a homemade feel to it the butter is amazing Yes the butter is what i remember most about this place whenever I go here The service is a bit slow and although the cozy feeling of the restaurant probably pleases a lot of people I don t enjoy it as much as the food The portions are huge I don t think I ve ever finished an entire meal there without packing some things I always pack the fried chicken for later A nice place to have as a constant weekend brunch treat after a long week although I ve never tried dinner 
GZJ-gF53S17nklTBN_Z00w CMU 1 1 star Happy hour just isn t that happy the place is packed you re in the way no matter where you stand and you can t sit unless you eat 2 1 star Mojitos are yummy and are so strong that they count as 2 drinks in one Too bad I was told that my mojito was the last mojito as they d run out of ingredients 3 1 star The guac fondly abbreviated on the menu is missing cilantro lime and salt Hullo 4 While the rooftop patio is lovely the food is only so so Soooooo it may not be worth waiting on the line which is by the door which is by the kitchen which has a swinging door that may or may not knock you in the face which is by the stinky bathrooms which winds all the way down the concrete stairs that you should not be near after drinking a 2 drinks in 1 mojito The End 
G_o2ww2LkF17Kbzhafq1jA CMU Overall this was an excellent restaurant However you can t have a soul food restaurant that serves lunch and dinner with no cornbread or corn muffins My meal was incomplete without my daily southern bread 
H2VA_XAq4tydlIa9LL24Ng CMU I came to Melba s for brunch yesterday and had a great meal The decor is not what I was expecting at all from a soul food restaurant it s very modern with black granite tables and exposed brick behind the bar I liked it though The music they were playing was a bit loud but I supposed it just added to the atmosphere It wasn t too loud for us to have a conversation or anything I ordered the French toast and it was really just the ideal French toast the way French toast should be always It was made from soft raisin challah and it was perfectly cooked not soggy not burned not undercooked The few pieces of fruit they served with it seemed kind of old but it really didn t matter because the French toast was so good I am sad now though after reading the other reviews that they didn t serve it with the famous strawberry butter They did give us each a biscuit buttery hot and delicious but it came about 30 seconds before our meals My friend got the vegetable frittata and said it was good I m not a huge grits fan but the ones she got with her entree were pretty tasty The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food It was pretty empty at 11 AM on a Sunday and there was only one waitress and a few people helping her The service was pretty good but definitely relaxed I look forward to coming back for brunch again especially to try those egg nog waffles that kept going by our table and hopefully for dinner to try the mac cheese 
H5t4DFoIJ9pdJkaOZIgdMg CMU This is Columbia territory Which is probably why I went with 2 friends from Columbia Don t try to fool yourself into thinking otherwise 4 frozen margaritas were strong came in a variety of flavors such as mango lime and strawberry good vibe w side bar seating inside on the roof poor waitress could barely speak english i m not sure she knew what we ordered most of the time she kind of just copied the menu after we pointed recommend guac chips cajun popcorn shrimp warm pepper goat cheese salad I d stop by every now and then if I was a Columbia student I guess 
-13q-Wn9dR449oEEbgXdFw CMU I ll admit it I was drawn in my the fact that this was the soup made famous by the soup Nazi on Seinfeld I thought I ve heard so much about this place it s got to to be good Man was I wrong I ordered the Italian wedding soup which was horrible It didn t taste like any Italian wedding soup I had ever had It was spicy and there were no meatballs Plus it was almost seven dollars for a little cup of soup I have had way better soup for 1 75 at my local diner This place is way over priced and over hyped 
-6cmWv8nhgEIyl8V84YScg CMU I had lunch here for the first time this week and walked away satisfied I had a prime rib panini fries and slaw Friends had BBQ pork sandwich grilled chicken and lobster roll They all looked good to me I won t put all my chips on Tiger s Tale until I go back a few times but so far the food has been good 
-EBDS8sW_26a4uv4lz1zaw CMU Honestly nothing strikes me in particular about Main Street It s an average place to throw away a few twenties at lunch Have fun I guess 
-eYTuzk6tvALcFnBszykGQ CMU Honestly I think that if anyone opened a store anywhere in the world where they deep fry their food as much as Haven does you d have a pretty popular fanbase I m proud or should I say not proud to say that I ve had every one of their named sandwiches like the Dirty Sanchez Bloch Big Cat etc Sure what s not to love Its the epitome of a glutton s paradise deep fried steak filled cheese layered eggy 15 inch hoagies that can t be eaten more than two days in a row because they ll cause a heart attack Sure it s intensely satisfying in a way that McDonalds or Burger King tries to emulate that greasy zone where the brain shuts down It s very much like a drug in that respect I think that this place could serve worms if they were sufficiently fried and layered in cheese I have no doubt that people would flock to it wait in lines and rate it highly on sites like Yelp The only reason I don t rate it lower is because well it s good stuff in a I m going to regret this later primeval way that satisfies our carnivore roots For under 10 you can t get a better experience at any other fast food joint But now that I ve had all of their best I usually skip over Haven to some other place in Princeton like George s Roasters next door or the Soupman Go once go twice but don t go after that 
-FjmwkxoE0H8qScdLiyN5Q CMU Awesome breakfast place Great thing you can look forward to if coming in on redeye from West Coast Although their coffee isn t the best But the pancakes are and that s why you eat there 
-L0hL7VXjdQkCiq4_X6FoA CMU Small bar area drafty patio and decent food 
-PALO6MUBB0ZtFFm6D8H1A CMU I ve been visiting Hoagie Haven since I went to high school at West Windsor Plainsboro South Years later I m still addicted to the place Although I miss the Bengali guys that used to make my food without any gloves on this place is the greatest I wish the current staff spoke better english and were better at taking orders I am a huge fan of the fat cats and make SURE you get the buffalo cheese fries I can t even imagine how much more ridiculous Hoagie Havens business would be if Princeton had more night life Hoagie Haven loyalist for life 
-qKkU4ODk_PVFdfkO-DRJg CMU There are enough other decent restaurants along this stretch of Route 1 Take a pass on this one I wish we had Overpriced food indifferent staff 
-TR5aFkYoA00jRrQoZmBCw CMU My name is carved into many tables here I ve been going to PJ s since I was a little kid I love their pancakes and mashed brown 
-u1cEL6lRa2iykQrkJvPww CMU I love the huge veggie sampler platter Entrees are large so if you can t eat a lot at one sitting be prepared to get the rest in a to go box Service is friendly maybe slightly on the slow side but I think that s because many items are made from scratch rather than just kept under heat lamps in the back The matriarch who presides over the dining room can be a little cranky Definitely recommended 
-uIdK6egYB6j2XNQZRKlXg CMU Great food Good fun Good prices 
-VLCpo_RNrP_wuUXDoiHJg CMU Yes unfortunately my weekend of sub par experiences and awful bars continues I was on my way home from Trenton this weekend when I got caught in the 100 year flood Ok maybe it wasn t that bad but it was pouring out I was having trouble seeing and I was getting annoyed so I decided I needed a beer I went on my phone and saw what was in the area and the Tap Room looked pretty cool So after parking down the street and sprinting through the pouring rain I arrived The first thing I did was grab some napkins and wiped my face down since I was literally soaked through my shirt Once I was done I put the stack of maybe 5 or 6 napkins down next to me at the bar Pretty reasonable thing to do right So the bartender walks up to me and I try to make some small talk Man its raining out hard I had to stop and get a beer Her response with a cold look was what is this garbage Really Is that really the way you going to start are experience I m not in the mood and I it s not like I brought my trash from home and dumped it on the bar It was a couple of bar napkins I didn t want to let that ruin my whole experience so I tried to move on She asked me what I d like to drink and I wasn t quite sure I asked her if I could try the Weyebacher She responds to me once again with an attitude what do you mean try Most bars let you try a small sample of the beer and if yours doesn t just let me know but I don t need an attitude So to finish my rant I guzzled me beer left exact change and walked out I am a great tipper I worked in a restaurant for 3 years This woman did not deserve a dime of my hard earned money On top of my experience the Tap Room seemed stuffy and unwelcoming I looked at the menu and it was over priced and nothing special I agree with Jessica other then the pictures of famous alumni on the wall this place makes you wish you never stopped 
-xfTWSK9WNrScSRj9276rA CMU As a Restaurant this is a great place to meet friends have a drink stay away from the 17 glasses of wine and then go somewhere else for dinner Prices totally outweigh the quality in actuality the food was equivalent to the Longhorn Steak House just a fancier atmosphere With all the choices in this area don t waste your time here 
-ZPWnCc8BHDrGhcfPFKSfA CMU I too have been coming here for years although it s been a long time since the last time Great spot for a casual yet good bite to eat Good burgers and we are fans of the Irish nachos Good beer too 
00txJQyKXauO5Enev79DNw CMU I wonder if the denizens of Princeton are miffed that Yelp s highest rated restaurant in their fair city is this unadorned sandwich shop with a steady stream of undergrads ordering their submarine sammies to transport back to their dorm rooms I had been curious about the place on my last two business trips here but never found the opportunity to go until now I ordered half of a cold hoagie the Provolone Cheese Pressed Ham and Salami see photos What did I think It was exactly what I wanted Speedy service Dirt cheap at just 3 50 Sloppy with all the fixings piling out What I didn t expect and I believe this is the clincher for people is the soft fresh Italian torpedo roll that housed all the ingredients It doesn t look like the bread is baked on the premises but it sure tastes like it The sliced meats are definitely a cut above the machine processed cold cuts Subway appears to use and the oil and vinegar doesn t have a rancid after taste Besides I walked in and out in less than four minutes FOOD 4 stars the secret is in the roll everything else falls into place AMBIANCE 3 stars not sure what to say except the makers wear plastic gloves SERVICE 4 stars not much for chit chat turnover is their goal TOTAL 4 stars hey if I was a Princeton undergrad in the middle of finals and out of Chex Mix and beer this is where I d go too 
01t1DKhyp-Bnogs2aiadDw CMU I LOVE HOAGIES Even if it will kill me Give me a Sanchez please extra dirty 
04rukel7bpug5qivmGCRZA CMU I liked this place alot They give HUGE portions I actually ate my entire plate on one visit 1 1 2 lbs of ribs My bf was mortified at my piggish eating sooo good I ve also been here just to drink and always had a great time Laid back sometimes crowded Always a great time1 
094PeGYgc71DjD0ygKCr7g CMU Great service The food came out with good timing and everything was fresh and delicious We wanted to try out some side dishes and made that our appetizer We had the adult mac cheese and brussel sprouts with andouille Both were great We tried the potato chips which were totally yum as well I had the house salad I know I am boring but it was great and it was huge My bf had the Blackened Tuna sandwich it was tastey but he was expecting something else Over all I would say the quality and service is there The menu isn t very big but the taste it there I would def go back again 
0G2chAzpxNhS4jc73QadJA CMU This is just your basic American food place with a bar It s kind of like a TGI Fridays but more expensive Covered in old skool Princeton memorabilia unique forks 3 prongs very medieval looking decent service The portions are large but even still the prices are high for such basic unremarkable food The menu isn t very exciting or exhaustive I ve never gone there because I had a craving for it I ve gone because it s convenient and slightly less expensive than the better restaurants around I ve never been there later in the night for the bar scene though 
0jD0EHkfU84S5KMgJzBIaw CMU Avoid Food is meh and insultingly overpriced if you are any kind of conscious thinking lover of food Service is okay but slow I hear the drinks are very strong and well made but I don t know this personally Wait times can be absolutely retarded even if you have a reservation I d rather go to the food court and eat at Teriyaki Boy no joke 
0lWlIQu9DmVvVkB_qyB9bw CMU This place has a really great outdoor patio and bar the atmosphere was my favorite part Overall above average food at a reasonable price but the parmesan asparagus side dish was exceptional 
0n3EyqEh-RXFFTVH0T5SmQ CMU This is the biggest Panera I have ever been in They even have a private room for events Panera s food is solid and its one my favorite chain places We were here for breakfast we arrived around 10 am and they still had a souffles I have noticed that many other locations always run out of them around 9 30ish The service was great everyone was friendly and the place was super clean Actually this was one of the best meals I ve had in Princeton over my little two day stay there 
0pru5qDW8egK-9N6PrgD8A CMU Liked the ambiance 
0QeFExyayyD25sgVPMbeBg CMU I was Googling this spot bc my bff is meeting me there tonight and low and behold I have been here before for brunch years ago and I the only thing I can remember is that the bread they serve you prior to your meal was pretty good Oh And the decor was pretty modern That s it 
0r0uoxG5JcOOtxjpYBO9HQ CMU Pretty average food I suppose the only reason it really have such positive reviews is bc there is a seething of breakfast places in downtown princeton Its definitely on the higher end of prices no where near Normas but still high for what it is Just don t expect anything above diner quality 
0ss1AeT5fxDALD23FnrH0g CMU Decent burger but the chili and pasta fagioli were sub par The gnocchi was drowning in a thick cream sauce The service has to be better than the dolt who drifted back and forth to our table today The vibe is a charming college town feel I wouldn t recommend this place for anything besides pancakes At least the bathroom was clean 
0UTGXd6-4R8v3l99TgTbrQ CMU Why go to Grease Trucks when you can come here I have never had these types of non cold cut sandwiches before and could honestly say I am fan The sandwich combos are pretty good but pretty unhealthy After I was done I got the same uneasy feeling after finishing a hot pocket I did not find the prices to be too much considering how much you were getting 
0uwl-XwDRz1Fl8xZIGiR9g CMU west coast just can t do hoagies like the east actually they don t even call them hoagies i had the capicola ham salami provolone and the philly steak both were excellent i ve had the real philly steaks in philly and this one can hold its own although i like the ones in philly better you can t really eat inside so we stood outside chomping away unfortunately i won t ever be in the princeton area anytime soon maybe never i ll just pray that my son or daughter goes to princeton 
0V-Bg44QZ33mNUY2Av6ZQA CMU I ve been here a few times The beer selection is pretty good and the prices are reasonable for Princeton I like the sandwiches and the fruit salad with goat cheese is pretty good The service has been good each time I ve been here and it has a nice ambience 
0vm6YAOIQJboCXUiAH6KSQ CMU Some 25 years ago when I was just a budding geek the precursor ritual to an all nighter at the E Quad was to pick up a monster hoagie built to be nibbled on till morning Hoagie Haven could probably lay claim to a chunk of every engineering degree awarded at Princeton No visit back here has ever gone hoagie less and yesterday was no exception I had the large pizza cheese steak damn the cholesterol of which half was wolfed down in minutes and the other half took me dang near the rest of the day to finish Their half 3 80 is the same size as a large at any mortal sub shop while their large 6 50 is the equivalent of a party sub or fence post 
0wF90JLYC8ygzCpL-zBMTw CMU Let s start out with an important fact for all its affluence and sophistication Princeton has always been a lousy eating town I don t really know why New Brunswick and Somerville topped it years ago So your choices are surprisingly limited You could do a lot worse then Winberies I used to go fairly often but it had been about a decade since I d been there I was pleasantly surprised The beer list while overpriced is very good Palm Southern Tier Sierra Nevada specialties Founders and more I had a good chicken sandwich which is all you want at times Occasionally I m still chastised for having a chicken sandwich in Rio when I could have had piranha but look it s just a white fish probably like tilapia My cohorts had lobster clubs and turkey clubs The fries were pretty good Service was friendly and fairly efficient I was happy imagine Sisyphus happy That is a solid recommendation 
0Xw0PV78eslxtUkxn118vA CMU 3 5 Good food good beer and friendly Been here twice 
0yHAQbqZDmUiGQwxQAjiEw CMU This is a reasonable dive bar It s most singular feature is that it is within walking distance of Princeton campus The beer is cold and cheap It has a junky but useable pool table If you re looking for these features the Ivy Inn will do the job 
1bLSJlViF_p8wjzf-s8g1g CMU Great atmosphere Cozy bar area Great garlic fries 
1F2ooNIHrat5MuwdYaZRHg CMU Good fries great fried calamari and great place to kick it What I like about the service here is that the waiters aren t pushy or intrusive even on a busy night 
1FZZsUfd4OnKop3oauk8Iw CMU Wow What a sandwich This place rivals Ike s in the Castro district in San Francisco with the crazy ingredient combos and melt in your mouth bread except it s cheaper and decidedly more spacious I opted for the Mac Daddy and thanks to other Yelpers only ordered the half size Just enough to leave me full without feeling disgusting Yeah This place isn t for you if you re counting points watching your waist or minding your calories But DAMN it s a nice indulgence Next time I m in Princeton I ll definitely be back 
1Grg2sYtNm4OuQLegGew_g CMU It is what it is If you like this kind of place you ll love the Ivy If you don t you won t like it 1000 better since the NJ smoking ban I would really give this place a 4 but I m giving it a 5 to counteract the moron who rated the bar badly because he was dumb enough to drink and drive The very nice bartenders will gladly call you a cab I m sure 
1I0z7LHziwxeW7YQMXO5pQ CMU What a waste of a great location Poorly prepared low quality food served by people who couldn t care less Is it that difficult to cook a decent hamburger Why does the menu say home cooked turkey when the stuff on my salad is that shiny gelatinous factory made garbage The entire Nassau Inn experience is incompetent The owners need to get out more The place looks and feels like it s run by people who have been shut in since 1972 
1itpUF7skIb7US-X6codfw CMU A fun friendly bar right across the street from campus with decent burgers great Wed wine nights and inexpensive happy hour specials The food isn t amazing but it is good for the area and the service is usually decent if it isn t overy crowded which it will get on weekends Definitely worth stopping by if you re in Princeton and want a diverse selection of drinks accompanied by good food of either the lounge or sit down type 
1K5Z0pv-Q2_ZRrlNmVBJPw CMU Great place to get a sandwich Not for the health conscious Many of the special sandwiches have names that deal with health problems the Heart Stop the Body Bag and the Block just to name a few The bread they use is outstanding and they are not stingy with the sauces I made a special stop with some friends when driving down route 1 and they all agreed that it was the best sandwich they ever had If you go late night be aware that the grill will be turned off exactly at closing time no matter how long you have been there but they will make cold sandwiches until the line is gone 
1Kk5D8sE6fCw-Bd6N8Po7Q CMU ONION RINGS ARE THE BOMB HERE And so are the cheap drinks 
1mZjVB1U2DPjWlOh2-Zn4g CMU If you have never been to a Hooters then you just don t get it When we arrived this Hooters was located inside a shopping center and wasn t that busy We were greeted by many females with their Hooters popping out I like the idea that we get to pick where we want to sit I don t like the idea that we don t get to pick what girl serves us Our waitress fit the blonde stereotype perfectly You expect to have a good time at Hooters and she didn t bring her A game She also forgot a part of our order I wasn t impressed by her skills or her Hooters The food at Hooters is typical bar food After you eat here you can easily fall into a food coma I did love the buffalo shrimp so much that I had to order another round The loaded tots are good to share and you need to eat then with a fork I do love the fact that you have a roll of paper towels at the table The beer here is alright Our Hooters girl poured us glasses from our pitcher My glass was served with a crack in it This is a huge safety and health hazard The bathroom in the Hooters of Princeton is the dirtiest and most disgusting restaurant bathroom I have ever been in There was even poo on the toilet seat I would definitely try to find another Hooters to visit if you want to see Hooters 
1n-OvM_eRgJy8_goUFJ-mw CMU This time I had the veggieburger sans sauce It was delicious crisp spicy and firm with fresh lettuce summer tomatoes and hot hot onions that made my nostrils burn I m gonna do that again soon The fries were pretty good too but I left half of them on the plate cause there were too many to be reasonable Also coffee was hot and Samara was incredibly attentive You win PJ s 
1p6o167uNS5cwE35lqqLiA CMU We love the quality taste and price Only drawback is no indoor seating 
1Qsv-viCLe35xDd8KBxxFQ CMU The hoagies at Hoagie Haven are the best You don t have to travel to Philly for the perfect hoagie when you have this awesome place in Princeton NJ The hoagie roll they use for their hoagies and hot sandwiches are amazing It is so soft the texture is perfect It s all about the roll and Hoagie Haven is right on the mark They are also very generous with the amount of meat and toppings they put into their sandwiches Their hoagies are not for the faint at heart so be prepared to have your cholesterol checked before you visit this place This is the best sandwich shop in Princeton and probably in NJ They have a huge menu of hoagie subs and hot subs similar to the ones you will see in the grease trucks at Rutgers University These grease hoagies are also popular at Hoagie Haven The lines are long so be prepared to wait but they also close late if your looking for a midnight snack My favorite hoagies are their classic italian hoagie and they have the BEST eggplant parmesan hoagie as well 
1rhrmKk6MB_vO_NIU2B09g CMU Service can be very slow and inattentive The wait for a table can get fairly long as well Atmosphere nothing very special here Clean and neat Price much too high considering the quality of the food and service 20 40 or higher per person Food hit or miss some things are amazing others are sub par 
1TKSgi4NSS5gQcMl538wpg CMU This is the one on Route 1 outside the Quakerbridge Mall I noticed there are 2 yelp postings for this location FYI Overall its just ok Quality of service has definitely deteriorated over the next couple of years I feel sorry for them when Cheesecake Factory moves in next door in the mall Very very disappointing happy hour Needs cheap early apps too on Saturday and Sunday 
1tr1-Msr0F7JdrvTaknoIw CMU So I met a few friends and had lunch here It s not a place I would typically eat 1 cause I m a vegetarian with the exception of fish every once in a while and 2 cause I m not a huge fan of BBQ taskting food aka steak house food but that is where they wanted to go so we did I had the fish special which was very good pricy yes but good I know this might sound weird but I love the decor of the bathrooms I know people don t go to a place based on what the bathroom looks like but I needed to say it The bathrooms are gorgous Dark wood and earthy tile LOVE IT Anyway so my friends love the food there and eveyone seems to like it so based on that and on what I had to eat I give it a 3 and 4 for ambiance and decor But keep in mind if you aren t a big meat eater like myself you don t really have much options except for like one or two things 
1VW3mxBpXqc6x4zrFK0woQ CMU The bar offers a club like atmosphere and the big horseshoe bar sits in front of a large Normal Rockwell attributed it s unsigned painting of Yankee Doodle that s fun to enjoy while having a pint on a Saturday Afternoon Princeton is not a town of super great bars and this the A B and Triumph make the borough s first tier Reasonably priced never noisy or overly crowded it s a great place to go with a few friends The food here is pretty good a big step above pub stuff The composed salads are particularly nice 
1W4ciYghmIlgwUNA0ssP_g CMU I had Sunday brunch here with my family The atmosphere is charming especially around the holidays if you like that ye old pub kind of stuff which I do It s tastefully decorated and cozy and the staff is very nice The food here is OK and my impression is that they are going for the gastro pub trend but it s more American B B hotel fare than English foodie style food The bread basket had too many overly sweet things and not enough savories and my Paris Brest Salmon with eggs was just ok What I would definitely recommend The eggnog New to the menu it is rich frothy and strong They make it with peanut butter which I found very interesting you can t taste it but the richness is there I think this place has a lot of potential but they need to decide which direction to go on the food Either keep it pricey as it is now and turn it up a few notches or make it cheap and cheerful I m not sure that I d go back for a full meal but I would definitely stop by in the evening for a pint and an appetizer 
1WHA0CqT8KX_AB9eCLWuJg CMU Hoagie Haven is a Princeton institution Cheap delicious fast and greasy food Whether it s noon and you re sober or midnight and you re drunk Hoagie Haven is delicious I highly recommend the cheese fries or buffalo cheese fries buffalo fries or honey mustard cheese fries or any of the fat sandwiches George s next door usually does better hot sandwiches though better quality chicken at least so if you are going during the day it might be worth checking George s out instead Otherwise they have the same owners and make basically the same food 
1WJb78rjsqYFDzNWWqQc0g CMU This is one of my favorite places in the Princeton area The outdoor Cabana is my favorite place to hangout being the only outdoor bar in the area for one but on top of that great frozen drinks and the food always consistent and delicious Try the mussels or the seared tuna i mean really I have enjoyed everything I have ordered The ambiance is very chill and relax so great for hanging out with friends I would definitely recommend Main Street Bistro to anyone looking for good food and ambiance The staff is extremely friendly and accomodating as well Never had a bad experience here 
1WJzCJ4BEi6zsd5GSiyVfw CMU My girlfriend had the m nage trois vegetable entree The fried tofu and stuffed pepper were good I had the grilled shrimp salad Good flavor but for a entree salad it was a bit small Plenty of shrimp and other items could have used some more lettuce We sat outside in the patio ish area but the plastic sides were closed because of wet weather A bit humid and warm but understandable since it was not a real room Barely waited two minutes for a table on a late August Friday night at about 7pm Nice wait staff albeit a bit spread thin Nice touch having Hershey s Kisses instead of mints on the way out Would have been 3 5 stars if Yelp let me but I ll round up for this one 
1Xc1QGvW64v8jFrnYTlPJA CMU If I was rating this place solely on dessert I d give it a 4 The key lime pie was phenomenal and the peach raspberry cobbler great But alas I m not rating it only on dessert I had the Gaucho Steak which comes with corn cakes and sauteed onions The steak was tasty but the portion was small Most of my plate was taken up by three corn cakes and a ton of onions The corn cakes were literally corn and batter that was fried into a pseudo pancake They were extremely bland The tiny amount of steak I was given for 18 was good The only reason I m giving a 3 instead of a 2 is the sole appetizer I had that was great Their Korean Short Rib BBQ sliders were awesome No complaints there That bumps them back up to 3 status in the hope that perhaps some of their other menu items are better 
1yNzvZkV-51fgmAVEwmskw CMU This place is pretty much a middle of the road neighborhood favorite It s a nice go to if you really have no other choices or ideas on where to eat drink since princeton is lacking in the latter The menu is american favorites and nothing extraordinary but nothing particularly bad the bar is ok small and cramped though when crowded One time me and my friends wanted to get drinks and one of our group wanted to eat so we were seated in the dining area But since three of us weren t eating they kicked us out into the bar area where my friend had to eat her bowl of chili holding it while perched on a bar stool It was pretty ridiculous so it s deterred me from bringing a mix group of people ie people who have eaten and want a drink along with people who just want to drink it s either or They have an excellent sunday brunch however 
1_zI7ZxDM5ikb_un-PQm1A CMU Most of the stuff comes with salad bar so you don t need to order an appetizer just to stave off any intense hunger We realized this too late While the salad bar is somewhat limited you can make something decent and they have pre made salads potato salad apple salad etc The dressings aren t labeled either This is pretty much what you d expected for a mid range restaurant chain it does the job of feeding you but the food isn t majorly impressive in any way Chicken tenders 5 pieces Ketchup Couple pieces of lettuce Not much more Just as good as any fast food chain Chicken cajun gumbo heavy oily The sausage is funny tasting The shrimp overcooked A fairly large quantity of food Salsa Guac the guac is a little homogeneous not enough of that chunky avocado The salsa is too chunky simple tasteless basically diced tomato onion cilantro etc Not like a dip at all Free cheesy bread balls these were actually pretty good The bread had a decent crisp to it warm and soft on the inside good savory flavor Artichoke dip a little heavy a little salty Lava cake not super impressive The cake was a little dry 
2B2_LeFL7o_Qsj7dHXPecw CMU Tasty and good A bit pricey 
2brFXEBGBE9kmuNhIbx6Vw CMU I think J B Winberie s was the very first restaurant I visited in Princeton some 20 years ago while there visiting former student It struck me then as it does now as the quintessential Ivy League college town eatery pub somehow exactly what you would think that would be with lot of wood and that pub in the cellar sort of feel Was back this time to visit yet another student so we stopped here for a quick meal on a Sunday evening Split a great salad and had a fabulous burger that was juicy and loaded with things that are particularly good for you The menu is quite extensive but with so many artsy restaurants in the neighborhood this doesn t seem like the place you d want to go for chicken cordon blue Not sure that was on the menu but you get my drift A really good sandwich burger and beer place is what THIS is 
2eLsbKIX0LerVrQwH2z4FQ CMU This place isn t anything special but we find ourselves going there a lot because its one of the most convenient when walking around Princeton its not toooo stuffy although its still in Princeton so you know never have to wait for a table and for our single friends there is usually a crowd of other singles for them to mingle albeit cramped mingling with Beer isn t too expensive appetizers are good for vegetarians although I don t think I ve ordered anything but apps I like the cheese dip with apples Overall its a pretty casual place thats nice and centrally located 
2eQz7y4wtdhSBv3yhxf6eA CMU Everyone s always talking about this place so I decided to finally try it I was expecting to be bedazzled by a sub but ended up being disappointed by a mediocre cheesesteak I don t get why this place is so hyped up I mean i ll try another sub next time perhaps one of the more famous ones but I m not a fan so far Maybe it s a Jersey thing 
2etLyfji3kY9VTh0UoVQxQ CMU Main Street Bistro has been a longtime fixture at the Princeton Shopping center and continues to provide very good dining at a very fair price We go often to MSB to avoid the higher priced mediocrity you ll find in Princeton Favorites here include the lamb sliders really excellent the monthly changing of the menu to include new dishes outside dining in the warmer months and the new cabana bar to enjoy a drink or more 
2IRSrwsCSFfmQZAyjxHJ3A CMU A family visit to Princeton yesterday How could we have not stopped in for some of the best Pancakes around So glad we ate here yesterday The taste texture and everything everything about em From the Buttermilk pancakes to the Fresh Blueberry Pancakes to the Bannana Pancakes all 4 of us were in agreement the best Not our first visit won t be the last 
2jLkwK-ZUYD-7ohAtpUWxA CMU Went here for the first time a few days ago walked in and got a seat at the bar right away We ordered food to go the fish tacos were SLAMMIN Definitely would go back again for the food The beer was good and the waiter was friendly Overall chilled out environment but might be different on busy nights weekends 
2jOilMd04yX7DSB5zWivZA CMU Don t know why most reviews give this place such low ratings I ts not great but it s definitely decent Been here a myriad times and never was disappointed Yes it s not a great place but it s most solid with good food and drinks 
2N73Qm_9KbUk1jlLjBIxCw CMU It s a greasy sandwich place Check that It s THE greasy sandwich place I m completely biased in that I went to Princeton and my formative Haven experiences were spent largely intoxicated Simply perfect food at 1 59am they close at 2 If it were possible to give bonus points for being optimal drunk food I d give them to the Haven I still live in the area and still have the opportunity to have a nostalgic hoagie every now and then Even sober they re great They re not haute cuisine They re great crappy sandwiches if that makes sense In my 15 years of Havening I ve only had about a half dozen things on the menu First of all contrary to some other reviewers opinions if you re getting a cold sandwich you re wasting your time Because I m old I ve been thoroughly scared of the new offerings Sanchez etc Cheesesteak Pizza cheesesteak Bacon cheesesteak Hot pastrami Chicken parm and the omelet subs That s it For 15 years on and off a greasy hole in the wall has had me happily coming back for one of six sandwiches I think that s telling enough Just get everything on whatever you order if you re new There is a good natured soup nazi vibe in that the other customers ll get pissed if you don t keep the line moving Rightfully so The hot gooey goodness of any of the hot subs will totally disintegrate the bread in about 5 minutes Time is of the essence If you want a fancy expensive sandwich and I have no problem with that there are about a dozen places in town you can go If you want satisfying gullet filling greasyness Hoagie Haven is the only game in town 
2rU9V7vy8EGt7_tTfAywMA CMU Dinner at the Bar Review Came here after a coworker a former Princeton ite and another coworker suggested this place as a place to catch AP on MNF Rollin Han Solo style I sat at the bar the pre game show was on with no sound and a Jammin slow jam playing in the background By Jammin I mean completely inappropriate for MNF No worries though the bartender turned up the volume on one of the TVs so balance but not hide the jammin slow jam in the background Ordered the Mediterranean Pasta with Chicken Muy Excellente I must say Quite enjoyed the penne pasta with chicken olive oil capers sun dried tomatoes and olives Was kind of sad to hear after I was drinking my Guinness that they had a 3 Tall Coors Light special I guess I had to be a local or at least just smart enough to ask do you have any specials to find out what they re specials are I enjoyed my time there could see myself venturing here if I was a local 
2ViOH-rsEsoZNViMc9z4Gg CMU I used to work here as kid in the 70 s Prices went up servings got smaller and quality of food left Princeton If you want to spend 20 for pancakes it s your place I was employed in every job this place has so I know it from top to bottom Not the same PJ s as back in the day The line used to go down around the Garden Theater And they would wait for over an hour Was tempted it to give it a one star but it s not that bad Carve your name in something when you get your seat 
2XKvWN_h1E3u-wYo3eZe8w CMU This was the first last Chili s I am going to visit Maybe I am bias b c I am a city guy but it was a chargin experience for me my friend But i guess franchises aren t suppose to blow your mind just barely meet standards now The food was sub par service was good despite the waiter forgot my sauce tequilla lime sauce for my entree Thinking back on it now it adding the sauce made my shrimp entree worse Their beer selections were wide but the beer I ordered was another letdown down guess it was in the fridge too long Two thumbs down But service was attentive 
2zT3hkU7v9a81JA6YmFM7Q CMU I read that this place was featured somewhere online as one of the top places to go in the country for pancakes I think it was also on the Food Network but I could be wrong about that Regardless I couldn t imagine it being in the same league with Norma s in NYC the hands down best place to get blueberry pancakes but I was willing to give it a shot I love pancakes My boyfriend disagrees with the list He lives here I don t when in DC we go to The Original Pancake House talk about FAB pancakes We ve been dating for over a year now and for over a year now I ve been wanting to try this place We finally went this weekend He was experiencing a weak moment The place is small and packed to the gills we had to sit at the counter The service at least ours was extremely friendly and efficient The decor is typical of any greasy spoon including the sign posted in the service station asking the wait staff to push selling the subs Think Mel s Diner and you ll know exactly what I mean Now onto the food J shorthand for my boyfriend s name ordered the pancakes eager to prove his point with sausage and extra bacon I ordered scrambled eggs scrambled dry with swiss and whole wheat toast Ordering scrambled eggs in a diner type place always produces anxiety for me because I HATE HATE HATE runny eggs This is not a problem at La Croix in Philly which happens to serve the most divine scrambled eggs ANYWHERE yes scrambled eggs CAN be divine My eggs arrived on a plastic plate no HUGE surprise I moved them around with my fork J awaited my verdict he knows how freaked out I get I smiled They were PERFECT This was a pleasant surprise And they actually had Chollula hot sauce I prefer never to eat eggs without it My toast was of the multigrain variety and it was superb a complete departure from the wonderbread esque wheat toast I ve had at other establishments But true delight came in the form of a potato mash that accompanied my eggs with a definite southwestern influence I had to fight to keep them to myself So far so good J waited patiently while I ate nibbling at his pancakes sausage and bacon Secretly he was dying for me to stab into his pancakes he loves being right And of course I did JUST that One bite and I knew exactly what he had been saying all along THESE WERE NOT GOOD PANCAKES They were rubber disks with faux maple syrup Awful Now if you want to experience pancake Nirvana I can recommend two places for sure and they are both already mentioned in this review All of that being said this is a decent local breakfast place and the epitome of a greasy spoon with prices suitable for any budget The two star rating is due to the incongruency of the restaurant name with the product for sale Pancake house Not a chance And in case you disagree the pancakes are made from a pre packaged mix Even I make pancakes from scratch and I don t charge money for them I actually think it is absurd that THIS establishment is even ALLOWED to own the pancakes com URL It s an insult to pancakes everywhere 
32OZjRQrjx3fbmqtecT6Gw CMU no increase in rating yet but yet implies that there will be a next time Nassau Inn management contacted us and refunded us the full price of our stay plus offered to make it up to us with a complimentary night at the hotel including dinner AND breakfast at the YDTR i gotta say THAT S customer service I m impressed 
38e9zuw0gjicnADCfVz3Yw CMU This is definately my favorite Hooters I have been to Friendly staff The food is amazing It s the usual Hooters food They basically always taste the same from place to place but I have noticed that I do like the food here a little than the other s The atmosphere is great though and that s what matters in a place like this 
38iWlRCAT-mYAgZTBPhzuA CMU Not the best often but healthy choices and you know what you get 
3CQSqGZILQE90e_VZrXuqA CMU I felt duped Stopped in the other night with a buddy of mine Ordered the nachos and was talked into the large order My thought was how much more could the larger order be if the small one was only 7 or 8 bucks Well when the bill came the nachos which sucked by the way as they were nothing more than a mountain of burnt cheese some beans and some variety of meat were 15 bucks Really That some coffee drink and dessert and my bill was over 30 bucks For that amount of money there are much better places than the tale Food has sucked for a while anyway We are taking a long hiatus from this joint If we ever return at all 
3DdmsSWlVcG7zULGkGkUoA CMU I ve eaten here twice both times for lunch I ve had different sandwiches both times and was very pleased I love the fries and the sandwiches were both unique enough to make an impression This is a great place to go for a quick work lunch in Princeton 
3dVkqCLbHxgFFJKzsX6T0w CMU Some restaurants are popular in spite of their location and or tradition others are mainly because of that PJ definitely belongs to the later being on Nassau Street and directly across from Princeton campus Familiarity and or quaintness appeals to the loyal and or curious weekend morning crowd There is not much distinction a restaurant can add to the familiar pancake but give PJ some brownie points pun intended for being creative like with its sampler blueberry raisin and banana the least favorite based on the collective family member opinions 
3Ik3lLXuCHutBcoe9_06Mg CMU I came here with a couple of teammates after the Mercer County Dragonboat Festival Almost everything else in the neighborhood was completely full or overpriced Granted to begin with we had a motley crew of just over 30 We had found seating at this seafood bistro that was far too expensive and then tried for a TGI Fridays that was too packed Then eight of us headed out for Chili s once we called and found out they had seating After finally finding the place we were seated and we were served drinks in a timely manner However the wait for the food was a bit too long I ordered a margarita grilled chicken with black beans and it was a little small for my appetite It was cooked well though I guess I should have ordered another side since I was still largely hungry The others ordered steaks burgers and wings They seemed to enjoy it though one of my friends who ordered a burger said it was too big to finish I guess we should ve swapped orders For what its worth it was overpiced The food was hardly filling and I remember shelling out 18 or so Service was too slow for my tastes and I regret paying with credit At least then I could have given them a lesser tip 
3Ik7Nlp0hYli1M_knVXRXA CMU WHATTT I m giving this place 4 stars WHY cuz some of the waitresses there are just awesome and we go there mondays for MNF They give out sliders with fries during the kick off and half time The drinks are strong the waitresses are amusing and the tvs face the large table we reserve Its right by the marriott and other hotels in the area so def its worth going there We are a bit of a loud crowd but they are really nice to us The salad bar you can get to go for 8 or even make a meal out of the sliders The frozen drinks are great and they make a mean milkshake By far this is the best RT ive been to and they keep it clean and fast service 
3NgQfIq2GNKIRpSYZezkJA CMU If you absolutely must eat Hoagie this place is FOR YOU Near cult following by the Princeton High School crowd and other Hoagie Haven junkies While you are there grab a few Hoagie Haven t shirts as presents LG XLG XXLG Cash only 
3okpTMEjupK0R5n4we3ZLQ CMU 3 5 Stars Absoultely love the Haven Great sandwhiches for an even better price You really cant beat it for lunch or dinner and absoultely wonderful as a late night stop Service is quick and always perfect 
3RZHRu1KagDi772IqsjgxA CMU I m not sure when this place actually closes as they are always open and PACKED after the bars let out at 2am Fast cheap and delicious are the ways best to describe Hoagie Haven especially if you re here with the after 2am crowd Definitely nothing wrong with this place highly recommended 
3Sw-wIf_prlf-CMQjLSq2g CMU Go to diner type place in Princeton The place used to be more fun when the writing was all over the walls tables and ceiling The fun giant sized breakfast characters were awesome There was a renovation and all that charm was erased I ve been back once since that happened and it s not the same for me The food is good but it was the ambiance that made it fun 
3V-0DeGrQzskInXCn1gPvg CMU A lunch staple in Princeton you can always find a good burger sandwich or salad on the menu Sometimes the specials are hit or miss Not bad for after work either spacious enough bar to hang with some friends and have a drink It can get crowded at times so you may have to wait for a table 
3zYV7F-VEPn-V-2cjLJgTw CMU I had the same experience this past Saturday night when we happened in at about six The hostess told us the wait was an hour and a half As we said no thanks and turned to leave she yelled out Just so you know if you want to come back on a Friday or Saturday night you need a reservation Very loud and very rude 
3_p6szBWKQl9O0fKKa9QUQ CMU Had a group of 7 people and the service was good I like the atmosphere of the place especially the HUGE fireplace at the back of the room Nice to sit around with a cold beer and good conversation Discliamer Food is a subjective thing like art What appeals to me may not appeal to you If something I ve written intrigues you take a shot and give a place the benefit of the doubt You probably won t be disappointed The food varied in quality I started with the French onion soup Nothing remarkable but good I could get the same soup in the same bowl at a hundred different restaurants The big hearty burger was char grilled a big plus and is a generous portion It was cooked exactly as i requested was crusty juicy meaty and well dressed An 8 on a scale of 10 I asked for grilled onions and should have been more descriptive as I got sauteed sweated onions Caramelization on the onions would have provided deeper level of flavor and probably a higher rating The Nassau chicken wings were average not great but certainly not bad Wasn t a fan of the dominant Worcestershire flavor in the Buffalo style and the BBQ wings were a little too gloppy Portions were generous The sweet potato fries were good a little on the thin side and if a thicker cut had been used would have made the fluffy inside that much better Lastly desert was good We split the pumpkin bread pudding cranberry apple crisp and the butterscotch pumpkin shooters All were very good I travel to Princeton at least once a year and would go to the YDTR if I craved a burger a cold beer and a warm fire So long from Texas 
4bPnurWrUaimomNTzBp_fQ CMU Seriously don t come here for brunch with a group of 5 it is an awkward number they do not know how to accommodate for and you will be waiting in the cold for 45 minutes with an impatient hungry father pacing the block Once inside the service was quick and our coffee cups stayed full The food was satisfying but no wow factor mom makes pancakes just as good Brother branched out and got jueves rancheros that was a mistake Stick to the basics here 
4eT2IXMBavyviRFwIPZGWw CMU It might have been the bread or some other kind of magical ingredient it was really great bread though but they somehow made the cheese hoagie I shared with a vegetarian worth my while WOW that was good bread 
4IgaxjBPgAmpnNOh8NzB7g CMU Probably the diviest bar in Princeton so it s a nice change of pace from the usual scene Very hit or miss some nights are a lot of fun and sometimes it s just kinda slow and quiet 
4imdeR2jLFNCh8vbDJBqhQ CMU Mmmm the perfect place for average food Granted that Tiger s Tale isn t a gourmet restaurant that uses high quality fresh ingredients the Tiger s Tale is a great place to grab a quick lunch with co workers or friends I ve been here a few times and I would have to say that the Lobster Roll is my favorite Fresh and light the lobster roll is a great dish for a good price This wouldn t necessarily be my first choice restaurant but I would say that the food is tasty the prices are reasonable and that it s ALWAYS packed I guess that says something right 
4KKN1dw9e644S98UKxwtEQ CMU The hype is not hype Hoagie Haven is for real churning out simple sandwiches that focus on their core ingredients and do not try to be fancy At lunchtime on the Saturday of spring break the place was still full of students and other locals ordering and moving aside so as not to block the flow The place has a working man s feel to it but there is an order in motion here that might take a return visit or two to fully grasp I felt as if I was in the way more than once holding up the line and therefore coming between men and their hoagies A friend and I decided to pick two and split them for a little variety We were surprised by the sheer size of each beast almost two feet in length a tremendous value for the price The hot pastrami 6 90 large was stuffed full of delicious strips of meat I found it a little strange that he asked if I wanted mayonnaise but the sandwich was eventually delivered with a beautiful and biting mustard that complimented the pastrami perfectly The breads were fresh and delivered from nearby Italian Peoples Bakery thrown into their over for good measure to make sure everything was toasty More toppings confusion ensued with the chicken parmesan 7 90 large which somehow ended up with lettuce tomatoes and onions Those were easily removed though and the delicious crispy fried chicken and sharp cheese shined The sauce was used sparingly and I think anymore would have completed disentigrated the bread before we could eat it I would have loved to have asked for some more on the side though as it was one of the best parts 
4Mzu-7drc2l1fi9sRN7GNg CMU This place is probably better for drinks and appetizers but I was in the area meeting up with an old friend so we chose Winberie s The salad was totally average The company was fantastic 
4nt0EWXwUjGw5JQJW-dNww CMU So the rumors are true Just OK food Good ambiance VERY strange space Bad acoustics When the jazz band was playing on the other side of the restaurant it felt like the saxophone was being blown into my ear as I was eating my dinner Very very annoying I honestly can t remember what I ate here so that should tell you about the food The drinks were not so bad and I noticed they had some specials during the week and for happy hour The staff was helpful and attentive The entertainment was entertaining Even while I was screaming across the table so my guests could hear me over the music I suppose the music was still enjoyable It is a shame the acoustics are so terrible here as the restaurant is a beautiful place While we waited for our table we took our drinks from the bar to the outside lounge area where we relaxed with pillows next to the indoor outdoor fireplace Inside the decor was modern and upscale giving off a romantic feel I would say give this place a try since they are not consistent in customer reviews maybe your experience will be of the positive ones 
4RBtYOId65O0rjPoNjkI3Q CMU Obviously a favorite place of some of the many people who live nearby but this place is absolutely nothing to go out of your way for if you are looking for a sandwich If you re looking to experience what Princeton students experience then OK take your turn at Hoagie Haven Its really just your basic Jersey sandwich shop including the strong food odor that sticks to your clothes even after just a few minutes inside They make huge cheap subs just like lots of other similar places around here They use Italian Peoples bread just like lots of other similar places around here The fillings are pretty much like they are at lots of other similar places around here They offer a selection of small and medium sized bags of chips and bottled drinks just like lots of other similar places around here 
4rr3Dfhv3r2pryEZS6xKTw CMU Not sure why this place has so many negative reviews but I ve been here twice and had a great experience Last time I went to the gym and came here afterwards for a small meal I ordered the honey mustard and bacon chicken sandwich which to my surprise was awesome Chicken was nice a juicy not dry unlike chicken I ve had at many of the so called nicer restaurants in the area and the ciabatta was super fresh Boyfie got the veggie burger which was actually incredibly tasty I didn t get any beer for the first time ever but they do have quite a nice selection of craft beers Sure it s not fast food prices at Winberie s but our server was awesome Our food came super fast And it was tasty Bottomline in my opinion one of the few establishments with food that is ACTUALLY good and doesnt tout itself as being sophisticated Come here if you re okay with a simpler looking place with solid food 
4TWyyGxYnz3ib-4eR7D7KQ CMU A Princeton mainstay Go to hoagie haven for great sandwiches at good prices And it s always a plus that the staff is friendly 
4VG5cXZR6FV818dBS2izOQ CMU I was happy to see they had a pancake sampler choice on the menu I tried their pecan and peanut butter and chocolate pancakes each of which were very tasty I also had one corn pancake which I ve never seen before also very good The mashed hash side was creamy and delicious Coffee was sub par The line was out the door but not too long of a wait Our hostess began to walk us to our seat and then decided to just point it out which was weird but not a big deal The server was really nice and on top of things A little pricey for breakfast about 20 for 3 pancakes a side and coffee but the variety and uniqueness of their pancakes somewhat makes up for this Food 8 10 Staff 4 5 Price Value 2 5 Atmosphere 4 5 18 25 
4ZA5igXuLjS2uHvHjEzsBw CMU when i order a mango chicken salad i m sorta like expecting um mango not canned peaches which is what i was given apart from the huge disappointment about the lack of mango the salad was also said to have avocado i got two SLIVERS of avocado on top not good enough we seemed to have 3 different waiters not sure why the food was sort of okay the service was terrible and nothing was served as described 
4ZBTZc-SsW3M2Hkm4jE5nw CMU fuck yeaaaaaaaa hoagie heartattack 
53NKuLd4VXdxb1G47d6KFA CMU Food is unremarkable and overpriced The server objected when I tried to plug in my laptop into the outlet Who does that 
58MlHxALU1F4Ifhp4FjXBw CMU A Princeton Classic with normally a long line to match The breakfast items are good and the pancakes are very tasty I normally side with pancakes but the eggs and regular breakfast items are good When it is busy there is usually a line to get in Service is fast to keep tables moving but overall a great breakfast place 
5ireGXSCM5_9Nvhns_xxFg CMU I went here after hearing it s a Princeton institution don t bother I ordered the Shepard s Pie and it was awful tasted like a Stouffers frozen meal I was going to say something to the waitress but she just came and cleared the nearly full plate of it away without asking why I had barely touched it To make matters worse the bathroom was just DISGUSTING It reeked of urine probably because it was a uni sex bathroom so maybe I m just not used to how men treat restrooms The only reason they got the second star was because of their apple cider that I must admit was delicious 
5MjlxsXVUIbaMykbheolmQ CMU I hate to be that guy but I have a hard time accepting that Panera bread a boring nation wide borderline mouth breather CHAIN can be one of the top rated establishments in my hometown Come on Okay so it has free WiFi It has good soup It is in a great location The salads and sandwiches are also good BUT 5 stars from almost everyone Maybe I am missing something And I do apologize if I have offended anyone 
5MYcb4C_RCGpgHIQSIA0yw CMU It was a alright Had some tv s pool table darts and decent staff The only thing memorable was when we first walked in the bar faces the door and this girl was sitting on a stool and her pants were a little too low in the back and all you see is a PINK THONG Welcome to the Ivy Bwahahahaha 
5Q7Hh0btc62bCndk3iiejQ CMU Happened here by chance Somewhat rudely treated trying for a table at Teresa s Said it would be 45 mins but looked at our crew 4 children and 3 adults as are you kidding No pun intended Found Zorba s to be empty although filled when we were finished Booths were great for the 7 of us and quite a few choices for vegetarians David and I really liked our grilled eggplant parm and the oil on the pasta was subtle but delicious They live out of state but its nice to know Zorba s also does breakfast since the Carousel closed and the kids enjoyed breakfast there My family will return for a visit and Zorba s is on our list I ve gotten the same dinner for take out and its very good 
5ratizGV9norU8DLKmsCBA CMU Been going here forever Doesn t get any better than the extra dirty sanchez or a greasy bacon cheesesteak 
5s-NDe-VDmes1zkEs7owFQ CMU Was there on Tuesday night 6 30 09 Landed here after the RIDICULOUSLY long wait times at P F Chang s nearby 1 20 minutes at around 6pm Wait here was 20 minutes Immediate seating was available at the bar My wife and I went down that road Showy interior nice looking space Bar was crowded with a bunch of regulars My wife started with a Caesar salad which was well executed She got the potato encrusted tilipia which was good I was thinking about the Maine lobster didn t want to mess with the lobster at the bar so I went with the Big Shrimp Trio 3 each Coconut Shrimp Panko Shrimp Buffalo Shrimp It came with three different dips to match the different encrustings of the shrimp I enjoyed it We had bottle of Pinot Noir 30 price point Our bartender server was very nice Its just a hunch but I would favor eating at the bar here if that is an option for you The service and quality of the food can probably vary if you are waiting at a table in the back 
5TeK22LOZxYe2-DVFlBL-w CMU Possibly the best french fries I ve ever had That is not an exaggeration The restaurant is split into two parts a pub like interior and a sunroom where you can sit down for a meal When we were here we got a meal in the sunroom part which was completely open to the air The entrance is in a side alley across from a psychic shop and the sunroom area looks out over that alley The pub part is dark and cozy Haven t been inside at night but the times i passed it after dark it looked pretty packed 
5tYa5N6JqkYQK-xJXaZJYg CMU NYE meal at Big Fish Our steamed clams trout and salmon were all good Not knock it out of the park good but for the total price of 75 for a meal appetizers and two drinks and key lime pie to take home fine Nice waitress Ask for spring water no charge colorful decor and the bubble lights make this an above the chain meal 
5uqfayVzGcag239mIaAj7A CMU Nope it s just not all that If you are starving really drunk broke or any combination of the above I m sure Hoagie Haven is fantastic Stagger in scream a number hand over 10 and get about 3 pounts worth of sandwich most of which you will wind up wearing while you gobble down your food on a park bench outside I can also easily imagine the nostalgia I would build around this place if it was part of my college experience But if you aren t from the area or are picky about food or are occasionally sober you will probably be like me and leave very underwhelmed It s all Subway grade ingredients on cheap white bread with fried food on the side might as well eat fast food instead No way Hoagie Haven should pop up as one of the top restaurants in Princeton 
5xVc_BvrwOlesqTxXzS0jQ CMU Enjoyed a fabulous Christmas dinner at the bar The salmon duck were both perfectly prepared with delicious sauces We went back a few nights later for drinks Jill made a perfect martini 
62IgjJEpON2-2bbakojtpQ CMU Surprised by all the Big Fish haters This has been my business travel standby for many years Big Fish will serve you fresh fish unlike most other nearby places I ve occasionally had a piece that whiffed but more frequently the day s catch is of very high quality The bar service happy hour menu and bread basket are also pluses Alas complaints about service and unjustifiable prices are reasonable The prices though high are about in line with the Princeton area 1 star for Danielle an excellent bartendress 
65CPMyvDLGev9GesFWJnSQ CMU he thought it tasted better than pat s steaks i personally wouldnt go as far as to say THAT but it was pretty good for outside of philly we were driving through the princeton area and he insisted that we take a little detour to stop here despite our having eaten a very large breakfast not even 2 hours earlier we still managed to house a 7 whole cheese steak that s wider than the width of my lap between the two of us the line was nearly out the door in this small dine out joint because each sub is made to order spending a few minutes in their large toaster oven to melt cheesy goodness onto the flavored steak meat but it s well worth it veggie toppings included outdoor benches 
65trgOTBK7Y3vZAs-Ej4yw CMU I would NEVER EVER wish this place on a person trying to go out and have decent meal or customer service I m making a list of things that went horribly wrong the night my sister and her fiance took out us for their rehearsal dinner the night before their wedding 1 For a party of 10 the rude waiter didn t bother to fill up our waters We had to ask another waiter if they could please fill our glasses up and he want and got our lame waiter to come and eventually do it 2 When the waiter did fill up our glasses he dropped water on one of our friend s cell phone As he walked away from our table while we started to comment on how rude everybody was he muttered an insincere apology 3 We never got a bread basket to tide us over until our appetizers came while the surrounding tables had obviously been given one 4 The food was overpriced and mediocre in taste at best 5 When I complained to the manager about the horrible service she apologized to the table and gave me a freakin meal coupon for 5 for her STUPID RESTAURANT I had to laugh and say I would never in a million years come back and eat at this terrible place they dare to call a restaurant DON T GO HERE 
66MuR7xaZV8IpTTiXIAYOw CMU Another example of a Princeton restaurant that could not exist in any other town like the Yankee Doodle Tap Room at the Nassau Inn It s charming in its own way and the little alley it s on is very picturesque but the food is really not that good It seems to be mostly pre packaged pre cooked plastic pouch food tasteless If you like Applebee s you ll probably be just fine But if you actually know the difference you won t like it here The service ranges from cheerful to indifferent You ll get much better food next door at Teresa s 
6c3uSf_9LwqBBtSS-0Volw CMU Very good food great price 
6CMZMfnTn3E_rNUlFldu3Q CMU I go to PJ s often with friends for breakfast or lunch It s just the go to place for many Princetonians The service is a bit slow since this place is usually packed but it s not too bad I love the nutella and banana crepes here along with a side of their fries It sounds like a strange combo but it s delicious I was amazed at their pancake portions which come in half a dozen 3 and a dozen 5 I guess they re very considerate about the hungrier souls P Also their two fer is pretty good 2 buttermilk pancakes 2 eggs 2 slices of bacon and 1 sausage link for about 9 People have said that this place is a bit pricey but I think that s just a Princeton thing I definitely don t think they have the best burgers though It s pretty mediocre Oh they began serving pasta recently too I wonder how that tastes 
6dG5jj9Bx-TOYm4w5rQ9_w CMU Nestled in the center of the Princeton shopping center lies the Main Street Bistro Bar This is a classic neighborhood restaurant with tasty food offerings in a comfy environment And for those inclined to imbibe at the front entrance lies a bar elegantly casual It was a cold and rainy winter s day when I first ventured into this place Dark green walls an open kitchen and warm wood furniture greeted me I sampled the Cassoulet of the Day a New Orleans styled option with shrimp andouille sausage chicken and grits Very very tasty and with perfect sized lunch portions just enough to feel full My dining mates sampled the chicken parm the Soup of the Day a cream of zucchini mixture and a Nantucket Cod Salad As one can tell the food is reflective of American regional tastes and is suprisingly good Other interesting options had Asian twists though none of us were desirous brave enough to try those Main Street Bistro offers great options for those with a love of dishes with classic American regional influences There are reasonably priced entrees and lighter fare sandwiches and salads It s a good place for a group with varied tastes And the desserts from the Main St Bakery and Care its sister restaurant near kingston st are to die for Visually and Consumptively 
6i38pv0G-K36Y2YcJo3n4Q CMU We had an interesting experience here We ordered 2 medium rare filet mignons When they came out they were both over cooked closer to brown than red Mine was close to medium well and my friend s steak was close to well done She sent her steak back and they brought out a new one this time it was completely rare hardly cooked at all On the third try they brought out a half decent medium rare steak but the grade of meat was so poor it was not very appetizing even when it was cooked correctly Third time s a charm right not when it comes to dinner That was the highlight of our experience but the wait staff was very polite and apologetic All said and done they gave us the whole meal on the house a manner that you rarely see honored at most restaurants these days which was very kind but I wouldn t recommend the filets The atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable with a pleasent all american smell of smoked cuisine filling the room They struggled with cooking the filets correctly but I would be willing to revisit Salt Creek and try a different plate 
6IrRTLnmh8IU9WKnlcKC5w CMU Once you are seated at the Yankee Doodle Tap Room you instantly feel smarter richer and whiter Just kidding I actually dig the Old Boy digs The food is good and the location is great I definitely think this place is worth checking out 
6Jqqt_9-ufXuHXqSUEGaAg CMU I am very disappointed in this restaurant Especially because they call themselves a pancake expert The pancakes and food here are comparable to those of Denny s except the price is about 1 5 times that of Denny s On top of that the syrup they serve with their pancakes are Smucker s syrup in packets not freshly made There is a crowd on the weekends and its cramped inside the restaurant The tables aren t the cleanest and the atmosphere is noisy and basically not appealing If you are in the mood for Denny s type of food then just go to Denny s or IHOP but don t waste your time or money on this joint 
6moMDrNiz-aRsIHYsycE_A CMU Ditto to the review below The only reason this place has a name is because we don t really have any other place in the same classification My mom i shared a western omelet and pancake trio I don t think our pancakes were even hot when they came out Utter disappointment Service was good tho and I enjoyed the hangings of princeton images from way back 
6Qg7lieohYb9gXOJ6HEIrQ CMU I think this place is a little bit really really a little bit overhyped because of the scarce options Princeton has got Nonethelesss this little joint has really good sub hoagie sandwiches to offer My favorites were western omelet hoagie with buffalo fries fries with buffalo sauce and ranch sauce They have other options too If you visit Princeton Since you should know this place if you live around the area and wanna have some quick bite this is the place to go 
6SqWLdyYBoKmywYuT3zvUA CMU I went here starving and anything would have been good yet I still was disappointed Zorba s isn t a bad place per say they just aren t a place I d go to again The place is literally across the street from Princeton University s main entrance First of all they don t have any alcohol no wine or beer with diner or on a hot sunny afternoon is a real bummer I got the chicken and bacon club and my girlfriend got the chicken ceasar wrap The wrap came with tomatoes which is pretty unusual in a ceasar wrap or salad The chicken in both our lunches was extremely dry and made it hard to eat The bread in the club was a bit over toasted which didn t help the already dry factor The lettuce was almost all of the white crappy parts of iceberg lettuce which is a pretty cheap way to go I think all restaurants should just bite the bullet and go romaine The fries weren t all that hot and were mediocre The onion rings looked pretty good at the next table but I guess I ll never find out because I wouldn t come here again unless I was with someone who insisted on having Greek cuisine I can t really speak about the rest of their vast menu but from what I experienced I ve had better and I think they could have took it up a notch 
6tZPvSpasMbo7V4DFSveBg CMU I was very surprised with the variety on the menu The food was pretty average The night we were there which I think was a Monday there was a great burger beer deal It was a little dark inside 
6YjKs87quF7skmiY5l-YNw CMU I spent many hours hear in college studying or chatting They have a great location that s easily accessible to both the University and Westminster Choir College Although their Chai is too sweet for my taste usually I do enjoy a good cup of it on occassion especially when it s not crowded in there and I can get one of the armchairs by the window Their sandwiches are good particularly the veggie one on focaccia but they re on the small side and overpriced for it The pastries and bread that I ve had have been quite good The main drawback as I see it is that it gets VERY crowded at mealtime The restaurant is large and there is ample seating but there have still been many times when I have not been able to get a seat Be prepared to take your food to go if it s noon or 5 30pm 
6yPSmP0QdSmcGdln1WG1nQ CMU This is a famous subs place Get the cheese steak with onions There can be horrible lines at lunchtime Years ago we used to go there from work during lunch we d call and place our order across the street on the pay phone so we could cut in line and get our pick up order 
73ZhGP5OjQ0_VIpQ6B-Y4w CMU The menu wasn t very inspiring but the specials definitely piqued our interest I had strawberry bass over a shrimp risotto delicious And my husband enjoyed his pork chop and mashed potatoes Wine list is pricey but we enjoyed the French cotes du rhone at a very reasonable 28 Our server Ally was super friendly and pleasant I m giving it 3 stars for the complete lack of ambience The bar was just off the dining room and we could totally hear a raucous trivia contest going on Definitely not a good date place but could be a good night out with a group 
7677RMDvRpUbhs3CfGzosw CMU I love this place It s one of those places you just HAVE to try at least once if you re visiting Princeton Order one of their specials the fat lady heartstop bodybag Okay but in all honesty the food is super good There s usually a line but they re super speedy They have a huge selection of drinks if that makes a difference Also I think there s a special that if you check in on foursquare you get a free drink OH and if you buy a shirt and take a picture of yourself wearing it in front of a famous landmark I think you get a free sub or something Free something Look to the left of the cash register there s a whole wall of people who took pictures 
76QwLQCJ3F8i59xynB9isA CMU average food place with bad service I guess it s a better bar than restaurant They served a dried out burger on a hard doughy poppy kaiser roll Wings were kind of greasy and stringy The sauce was really average not much spice Potato skins were disappointing They were strips of potatoes with very little bacon with a good amount of cheese melted over them We were sitting in a dining room with five or 6 other tables eating Each table had a different waitress which seemed very strange Place is close to a good stone shop 
7DOXzEdY1pnPxMTnb6Zjpg CMU WHOA THIS PLACE IS THE TITS ha low hanging fruit I know but it had to be said Why so negative folks Rolled in there with my son Paxton on Saturday to celebrate his 2 month birthday he s a man now Immediately were greeted by the manager with a car seat holder for us to put Pax in our son goes everywhere with us and this is seriously the first restaurant that has made sure we were properly accommodated Big screens up with the Olympics and Yankees game Clean The music was awful Awful Like pop music but shit I ve never heard before just awful One random Tom Petty song and I was like maybe maybe this will get better Nope I got a Goose Cosmo and it was 4 00 Four freaking dollars Wings were good as usual I got the hot dog and that was a big dog twss The actual server was okay a little less attentive than I would have liked hence the four stars versus the five found ourselves several times having to flag her down and they weren t that busy Overall maybe I m just still in mourning over my Maple Shade Hooters closing so every single Hooters will always be magical in my eyes but I really think this is a solid one All of the girls were cute too Definitely didn t have the JV squad on and it was a slow Saturday mid afternoon 
7eL4jWgr10ut2fr1lBsgaQ CMU The fennel dusted seared tuna is one of the worst things I ve ever eaten The tomato caper calamata relish that it came with Ill It was salsa sprinkled with capers One of the worst meals I ve eaten BLERGH 
7FoMxI8GDG8F3-4kCk1HLQ CMU One of the best hoagie places in Princeton This place has been around for quite a while and although it s pretty much a hole in the wall what you get for what you pay is excellent 
7g8G9hhfwePdu2CiOdIi4A CMU The location really is good nestled between Target and Wegmans The lines move VERY quickly and even though it looks long it doesn t take very long for it to be your turn I had the cream of tomato in a bread bowl and it was delicious and NOT spilling out of the bread I hate when I lose soup like that The outdoor seating was very pleasant and the disposal flatware station really made it easy to eat outside Everything is very well kept and always clean and orderly 
7hShelvwK_jRCg9Txvk7tQ CMU Two colleagues selected the Big Fish and then phoned to invited me to join them at their table After I sat down and looked at the menu I peeked at the yelp reviews uh oh Fortunately my dinner was better than I feared maybe even a lot better The list of wines by the glass was not a good sign but I asked about draft beers and found that a couple of their beers were acceptable I ordered a spring seasonal from the Boston Brewing Company and was perfectly happy with this selection Because the menu reminded me a bit of what one finds at Legal Seafood outposts I ordered a caesar salad and a blackened Atlantic flounder with sides of grilled green vegetables and roasted red potatoes The food was A OK and the service was cookie cutter fine The prices are maybe a tad high as other yelpers have suggested I have no intention of bookmarking the BFSB for future visits but I won t kick and scream if I m part of a group that heads in this direction 
7piHRuhaUZdHk8FgREN3qA CMU Tika S s review is right on I went to PJ s and was expecting a life altering experience judging by the long lines and it s star status I was pretty disappointed We had to wait a bit but probably only 15 minutes The restaurant is unique on the inside with names carved everywhere some even from decades ago The service was bad but the food came out super quick The pancakes were a little above average but not the best I ve ever had The bad part was it was VERY overpriced Leaving full but somewhat ripped off I would probably never return to PJ s 
7QmPKHDCRE9i7uucbl4EaQ CMU came here on cinco de mayo because the wait at Chevys next door was ridiculously long not worth the 90 min wait IMO they weren t too busy and we seated ourselves they had a few beers on tap but mostly domestic decor and environment was like your typical hooters background music sports on tvs throughout and okay girls we were greeted promptly and our server took time to share with us specials so we would get our moneys worth thanks chels their lots of tots baked potato style tator tots was really good w sour cream and bacon bits the pickle chips are a must it may sound weird at first but they are pretty addicting just like the menu says everything came out pretty fast the only thing was our waitress forget to bring out our celery and bluecheese hooters regardless of location is always good for hangout and wallet friendly food and drinks 
81P7tpcn-3oagkqhn3z2cw CMU I ate here many years ago and had a bad experience so I never went back I have been back for Happy Hour or drinks at the bar a few times and while the experience has been less offensive it s still a shitty place to go The restaurant is decorated nicely and so it has good ambiance but the food is meh and the service is awful After reading the reviews on here I can see that others have experienced the same lackluster service I was there for drinks not long ago and we waited quite some time at the bar for a table outside Finally when we were called to be seated the hostess informed us that the paito area was tricky and that she could only seat our party of 8 separately at two different tables Yeah we were totally hoping we could sit at separate tables that s why we waited 90 minutes to be seated 
87U6Ef5cQTjU2bq1I1cRsw CMU I will always love this place boyfriend and I had out first date here way back in 1997 The food is always good and a nice comfy atmosphere yes i know not really a romantic first date place but hey we were 17 what did we know plus many of my hometown friends and even my brother has worked here over the years 
8BBTbWnMBZP81pdzDQiqOg CMU My wife and I always get the same thing a whole eggplant parmigiana We split it in half and she usually can t finish her half They batter and deep fry the eggplant Be sure to eat it immediately or else you ll have a soggy mess Also God s gift to mankind deep fried mac and cheese wedges Just order it and thank me later 
8fs3PBgbCwLdaie_e6wTlw CMU Came here while visiting princeton with my family My dad ordered the cheese steak my sister ordered the hot pastrami I had the cheese fries with mushrooms The small sandwiches are HUGE DELICIOUS The cheese fries were a little on the greasy side but still tasty with some hot sauce I will def come again on my visits to princeton 
8fV43zSOWPSFKOu_OHyf0g CMU This place should be called PJ s Diner and not PJ s Pancake house They ve changed so much that they ve lost their sense of identity Please stop trying to be something you are not Take a page from the Chipotle s and Five Guys of the world and focus in on the few things you were good at MAKING PANCAKES AND BREAKFAST I m sad to say that the few things they were good at making aren t very good anymore Something s changed new receipe different ingredients I don t know but it s not good I do know that I m not paying for what they are serving these days Their pricing is out of control for what you get I would come home to NJ and look forward to going to PJs but not anymore I can get an amazing breakfast at the Princetonian Diner and for a much better price than I could ever get at PJs Not sure what went wrong but they need to course correct and quickly 
8KcBP-abgbYGsezeXyMI7Q CMU Like Anja I don t get the hype Some people around me at work absolutely LOVE this place and go there whenever they can For me when I have to go I usually am not so thrilled or looking for a way out The food is just so so in my personal opinion and its a bit pricey for my liking versus some other local spots that you can get a good value from A lot of times they put stuff on the sandwiches that I cant even figure out what it is that detracts from the base flavors of your sandwich etc Every time I come here I try and get something different still haven t found something I am impressed with yet Its a big place which is nice but man it fills up quick Get there early for lunch if you want a table especially if you have a big party Other than that its a Panera Don t expect special attention at this store Staff is mostly just focused on getting you in and out versus trying to help you decide That s fine if you come here too often and just want your food For me I am still trying to figure out why people congregate here 
8QY7HCsDo63mQ0sQLRNRqQ CMU When Grille is spelled with an e you pretty much know what you are in for a glorified chain restaurant that is designed to make you feel like you are at a fine dining establishment Located in an office park off of Route 1 I was amazed to see that they offer valet parking In an office park Where there is an abundance of parking spots The fact that those guys are stuck out there providing a unnecessary service while being forced to listen to the cheesy music pumped outside made me very sad For what they are trying to do they do it well it s just not really my scene Someone obviously spent some coin building the place but I failed to see the need to have the outdoor fireplaces lit on a freezing cold night It s a big space with high ceilings and no noise control so it s very loud I think it s designed that way so that you feel that you are at somewhere very popular and lively There is a large bar which includes a communal table and a very large dining room The place is packed You can be sure to find the latest sports event on the TVs We showed up without a reservation and sat at the communal table in the bar Our server was great and the food was ok It s the kind of food that sounds a lot better on the menu than it is I started with the lobster bisque which was good For my main course I had their famous pork chop which was much much too salty The portions were huge but it didn t make me want to finish anything on my plate or take it home I d only go back to watch a game and have drinks and appetizers or if I were staying at the Westin and didn t want to go very far Entrees are too expensive for what you get The best money spent at a place like this is the corporate dollar of your expense account and the majority of it on alcohol 
8UaD6SwPga77Pf9cwX7PMw CMU apparently alot of kids of my school Princeton high would go here to drink back when we were underaged I was always too afraid of being caught or spotted by my parents and or one of their friends who always seemed to catch me when I was somewhere I wasn t supposed to be remind me to tell you the story about the time my dad found out I was at a Princeton University party at 4am because apparently one of HIS friends was there so I never went until a few years ago when I met up with a former classmate to have drinks and catch up on life Decent dive bar I remember there being a relatively good selection of beer Staff was well virtually non existant mostly because it was i think the day after Christmas but nice enough Pool table maybe God I m senile can t remember now I usually choose not to go drinking in Princeton to avoid running into people I know i hate those OMG how have you been conversations especially since I left school mid senior year and to this day apparently people think i was in jail or got knocked up and sent away ugh but the Ivy is a decent place to grab a few rounds 
8VNxZxLj-Mgv2B2jzAwzUw CMU Other than the fact that I get stomachache every time I eat their sandwiches this is a good place to go in Princeton Pretty decent in price Try the chicken parm It s as good as it gets 
8vTW3w2rTGqnErH0zV4bSw CMU There s not much I can say that hasn t already been said but I just couldn t call myself a Yelper if I didn t chime in with my deep feelings of love and admiration for Hoagie Haven The food there is so good that once my husband and I drove from our place in Brooklyn to Princeton just for a Hoagie Haven sandwich gobbled it up by the fountain and then turned right around and went home Now that s love 
8Wgj3nd2Si1ZFnaCjMBMiw CMU My Princetonian husband has many tales of the Haven from late nights in the E Quad When we were there for Reunions in 2002 the line around the block told the whole story I ve had many a meal from the Haven and have never been disappointed Apparently the prices haven t changed since the late 80 s We stop in every visit we make to town 
8WnWYipVdobK15FDCsIUcQ CMU I love PJ s A sweet little pancake breakfast dive on Nassau St right across from the university It s been a Jersey institution for as long as I can remember Make sure to give yourself some time though because there s frequently a line winding down the block for it On a weekday though you ll walk right in 
8zWNlLDLkLsWTWlb9Y2wDA CMU Cash only Cheap good subs and sandwiches No one I know of has ever been disappointed 
90H_M5oIKQ_jM36UEEDp7w CMU Chicken parm from Hoagie Haven A masterpiece of massive greasy proportions My nostalgia prompts my taste buds to crave your goodness For once in the rare occurrence of restaurants Hoagie Haven s name appropriately reflects it s cuisine 
94O70z3HlM7hRSmzOh4LCA CMU Make sure you are prepared to wait if you come after 7 especially if you have a party over 4 There are few large tables but many small 2 person tables just because of the size of the room So best case is to come with just one other person the wait shouldnt ever be more than 15 minutes if you do that Portions are LARGE Lamb and steak are amazing Service is friendly If the service is slow its because the waiters have to wind through dozens of people standing and drinking at the bar Please consider that before you complain Its loud But then again its a bar grill The volume only adds to the atmosphere No one is coming in here expecting a quiet conversation 
986tuUTG60SRX_OxzyQuPw CMU This review is from 4 26 12 I just was lazy and didn t finish it until now Had my first bloody mary here ewe It was SO peppery I couldn t breathe Our waitress is was not great she was super awkward and kinda dumb Lol and didn t check on us at ALL The food was decent but way over priced not going back there 
9AhmCE-lx4HQxRok-KF28Q CMU Saturday evening soon after 5pm and a few restaurants are not yet open for dinner making gastronomic selections limited Winberie s at first appears to be a college bar but it s menu challengs that impression and of course Princeton is not your typical college town The restaurant at least at that time is full of parents with young children seated at tables with a healthy attendance at the bar Lively at 5pm so let s go Fancy bar food is what I would call the menu It s got your Joe The Plumber favorites like steak hamburger and some sort of pasta but looking deeper you ll find details that remind you of the sophisticated Princetonian atmosphere the steak is fancy the pasta specifically regional and there s a fish or two I imagine being a Princeton student and taking your family here with draft beers to please seasonal microbrew Dad a white wine spritzer for Mom some Bud Light for post college Sister a big body Napa Cabernet for the Uncle and a dry martini for the alcoholic Aunt Life s good A child s menu is fun crayons included and the service is very helpful Clean bathrooms too 
9dMNcwUmby1EsCwDLwX5pA CMU It s been a while since I were there for lunch dinner but I absolutely love this place when it comes to happy hour They have special happy hour menu which I love LOVE LOVE 
9HCEU1sCR7aZIK2zS_SC6w CMU Ok you re in a strip mall on a nondescript stretch of road that while it could be anywhere in America happens to be in Princeton NJ With no car and choices like the Macaroni Grill Big Fish seemed like the least evil of the evil choices available So I sat at that bar and was happy to have it be Happy Hour because the food while not great was cheap So my review and recommendation is meant to highlight two things Strip Mall Happy Hour That s all I have to say 
9jIQ0qJa2ywfxTZGdocSwQ CMU This place is a good option for brunch but there s nothing on the menu that would really blow you away Prices are reasonable but be prepared to wait on wkds esp when the university is in session Grab a seat at the counter if you have a really small group it ll cut down your wait time 
9kctp-DVBuu3o88amjHVPw CMU A very nice Italian restaurant where the Rusty Scupper used to be The seafood was incredibly fresh and the other dishes quite tasty A good addition to Princeton at a price point that s very reasonable The decorations and the ambiance are both great 
9MTeHt9S3WXWee9OPLSbJw CMU I ve been here quite a few times It s one of our old stand bys when we can t think of any place to go There is a small dining area and some tables around the bar Table service is much better than the bar service I dont think I ve ever ordered something that disappointed me The Tiger s Tale Chicken Sandwich is awesome and the Fish Tacos are fantastic though i d order them without cilantro next time It s good food cold beers and reasonable prices Check it out 
9p71dUg8qjgfnH2Ww7jHgw CMU This place would be so much better if there was room to move Has to be a better way to arrange the bar area back end is vast and usually empty while the bar is crammed and loud 
9qexy7j8bTfRhgTH-ikYCg CMU I ve been to Salt Creek Twice Once about 2 years ago and again about 2 weeks ago Salt Creek would have gotten 4 stars 2 years ago but today I would only give it 1 The service food and experience have all gone downhill I had the Salmon which was HORRIBLE Fishy tough and expensive The waiter was an inexperienced part timer who could care less about us He sat my wife and I in a room with a family of 10 screaming kids Note to Salt Creek When you see a couple come in consider that they may be out for a dinner with out kids and would want to sit somewhere quite You had plenty of seats in the main dining area The only nice feature about salt creek is their bar area Nice fireplaces Although VERY loud The acoustics are so bad in this place you leave with a headache You can hardly hear the person sitting next to you I will not go back to Salt Creek In an area like Princeton Salt Creek should of saw an opportunity to offer consistent service food and experience I blame their demise on poor management with lack of vision 
9SvU1mcfJV_JnwIdlLP3sg CMU Somehow this always crowded restaurant provides fast service and quick table turnover Plus the soups in bread bowls are to die for 
9sZ8jboCNoKeR-kPnm2mqg CMU Zorba s Brother is way too expensive for the quality Sitting on the main drag in pretty little Princeton it s easy to see why it s sitting on prime real estate so they pay through the nose on their rent and take it out on the legions of preppy kids alumni and passers by with high disposable income Anything that isn t pancakes will run you upwards of 10 14 16 for their gyros 9 for sandwhiches Their pancakes are crap Soups unimpressive potato was gelatinous rather than creamy but tasted ok Lentil had tasted alright but was in dire need of pepper or some spice Service is ok The one waiter definitely speaks english but it always feels like a challenge communicating with him not in a fun challenging way but in a no seriously why dont you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth kind of way Food doesn t take long to come out They said they close at 8 30pm on Tuesdays What The bottom line is that this is Princeton there are plenty of options if you want to blow 15 on a mediocre meal Try to not let it be here If you want soup and a sandwhich or a salad go to Panera Bread or Hoagie Heaven up the street and save yourself some time and 
9TYOZ-V712FCIg9xgIJfEA CMU OK I want to be honest and give a helpful review I LOVE HH But if you want a 5 star experience there are a few things you need to do 1 BRING CASH 2 Don t go there for a sandwich you can get any any other subshop that s not what they do best 3 Go for one of the HH crazy concoction subs but read what is on it Customize yours Ex I get the Wake Up Call without Pork Roll never been a fan and ketchup instead of hot sauce 4 Don t be afraid of the queue they know how to get you out the door quickly Pick out your beverage while you are waiting as they have quite an impressive selection 5 You can step to the side after giving your order maybe even pay at the register but don t wander far as you will be asked what condiments you would like on your sub 6 Enjoy an out of the ordinary taste treat we are not talking gourmet food by any stretch but this is THE place for late night cheap eats That s the niche they have carved and they do it best Where else in Princeton are you going to get fried eggs with your bacon cheesesteak burger It s a taste like no other and if it is for you you will be craving it at least once a month So please don t go and order a chicken eggplant or meatball parm and then give the place 3 stars because it didn t live up to the hype The other subs are all edible and very worth the money A whole 12 Eggplant Parm for 6 C mon If you don t get the first sub choice right come back one more time and try something different 
9tZXC2B_HgR0qfoK8elXrw CMU I stopped here for lunch on a trip to Princeton with a friend There aren t that many restaurants around the square and this one looked charming since it s tucked away in a little alley When we arrived we were presented with the option to sit in the closed in patio pub or dining room We chose the patio since we were already in it and it was a sunny quiet setting Everything on the menu was pretty overpriced burgers and sandwiches were mostly 15 16 I got the chipotle black bean burger in a pita 13 with fries The burger itself was super mushy and not that flavorful It also came with tzatziki sauce which I m pretty sure was the wrong one My friend s medium rare burger came out well done The only saving grace was the fries As far as service goes the waitresses were nice enough but we had four different ones They didn t seem to communicate with each other which was a little strange I don t think I ll be back 
9XVHbgF8JvO6UXkM3brDHQ CMU WHY IS THIS NOT FIVE STARS No words can describe Hoagie Haven Even thinking it makes me shed happy happy tears of joy The hoagies are not for the faint hearted I m a small Asian girl and many have told me one cannot finish a full hoagie on the first try This would ve been true if I wasn t starving So tip Go when you are starving But once you start you just can t stop It is ridiculously good I m a firm believer of the Heartstop The first time I met him my heart did indeed stop Your virgin bite is something you ll remember for the rest of your life The first half comes easy Once you reach the second half it only becomes all the more savory And at the end you could only wish for more Five minutes later you ll feel so full and satiated It s a pretty fulfilling rollercoaster experience All the haters that gave this place four stars did not have one of Hoagie Haven s signature hoagies It s impossible to not fall in love with this place Best in the country FLY HERE TO HAVE A HOAGIE HAVEN HOAGIE It s dirt cheap and it s so good it can t be real but it is Going to get a Heartstop when I get back to campus for sure 
9Y90FWzq4fiYJIs4NSUwAw CMU The hotel I was staying at suggested I try Big Fish and I wasn t disappointed The food was great the atmosphere was good though a little loud and the service was good If you like seafood I would definitely recommend this restaurant 
9yvMH9ORxiIfO7pMhyCcDw CMU The food is good but the service is mediocre 
A3exs9mqwOz60HN9j6JI2g CMU Not a bad place I ve eaten here twice this week mainly because it s open late enough to serve food until rehearsals end The food is good but overpriced The Cajun Mac and Cheese is really quite good The wait staff is generally helpful but the servers are reluctant to seat people unless the party is complete this is fine if the place is packed but in neither case was is so If Princeton had a wider variety of later night eats available I d probably try to find something else but this seems to be about all that s available with the exception of Hoagie Haven after 10 00 
a7xbi-28ZAlqu8z0eEICtQ CMU Not bad nothing sensational I actually ate here a few times just because it was fast and convenient 
aAl-Lv7gBQrWqzALYdljVQ CMU My wife and I had the most disgusting and yet expensive dinner here The food is on par with Long John Silver s and salty as hell The service was slow and unresponsive Seriously if your customer hardly touches the food wouldn t you want to know why This place really thinks and charges like it s a 4 star restaurant while in reality the food hardly qualifies for a fast food joint The wine by the glass tasted stale we would actually have preferred a glass of boxed wine I just don t understand how an establishment like this still operates Maybe there are enough suckers like me that are willing to give it a try Really save your hard earned money and go to McDonalds instead This place really stinks 
ACVbeJEJW0kqaNB3Ks1FdA CMU What you see is what you get This is a steak and chops heavy restaurant that could be situated anywhere in America except in a city that knows real dining Luckily we had an outside table The inside music was just too loud for normal dinner conversation My steak was nicely prepared however my wild mushrooms on the side were decidedly canned I suppose my hopes were too high Salt Creek Grille has a nice wine list and it is probably a great place for large groups on a week night Otherwise I wouldn t try it without a reservation 
AeldEue8bI1HgyECe03q6w CMU Overall I like Panera but this is the absolute worst location I come here pretty much every weekend for breakfast bc it is the only convenient place on my drive down to visit my mom The food is not amazing but deserves more than one star The service is consistenyl horrifying No sense of urgency no consistency in the food and completely disorganized Over the last few months it seems to actually be getting worse which also explains why there are less and less people 
aFIX3VXiHqf6FhGPPycvIw CMU Can t really beat the location of this bar restaurant now The prices are fine for Princeton especially being within Palmer Square I had dinner here for the first time last week it was A OK like my rating suggests Ordered some pasta with chicken the dinner portion wasn t very large it was most likely 4 6oz of pasta Not sure if the 18 price tag is warranted considering pasta is so cheap but whatever I don t think I d come back unless I had to otherwise it s just ok 
AfjKMH75UBkXNzFA6iuEYQ CMU I used to like coming here after school Love their cuban chicken panini and chipotle chicken sandwich Both are very flavorful Their soups are overpoweringly salty I can never finish even half of them without having to down a glass of water They are very generous with the rolls though A couple times I finished them and they gave me more The salads are nothing special My favorite baked goods are the toffee nut cookies and the bear claw Amazing Overall the price is alright and the food is good but nothing to rave about 
AhfKBS_2yW_UWPsfG91p5Q CMU three words pricey dirty diner This place has very mediocre food I had the two eggs with potatoes sausage and toast everything was just blah not good not great and not bad took a bite of the pancake decent but not spectacular Service was slow and somewhat bad quick at giving out the check and taking the credit card and standing right next to you while you sign the recipe For the price and the bad food and service I think not 
aI2kgcQzp77oKWrSzjUdOA CMU The service has been getting spottier including the servers forgetting to let us know what the specials are and having to be seriously flagged down even when the dining room is sparsely populated this is in addition to the wines on the list being out of stock I don t know what is going on with a lot of the places that were better last autumn as it appears the trend of service in Princeton becoming downright bad since the springtime has continued except at Triumph oddly enough where it actually improved 
AiofLjgpM1YQPVUj5fNFng CMU Consistently good food clean great TVs for the games Buffalo chicken crazy Cozy inside 
aLcqFuEr4cLLYr7eaGPC8A CMU We went after work on a Thursday looking to have a few beers to avoid traffic The place was packed with people no place to sit and barely a place to stand All the tables around the bar are reserved for dining so we stood for about an hour before getting lucky with a stool at the bar We also wound up sitting next to parents with their children who were waiting to eat The food was good and it must be crowded for a reason so I gave it 3 stars but I won t be going back because I hate standing in aisles at crowded bars 
amNH8iUQj9jUiieZqqR7Hg CMU Very average food and way over priced for the quality 
amoFf2_lbdy67PtXE-hZYw CMU This Applebee s was my first experience with their food I do not eat there so much anymore however this particular experience was very good for a first timer Food was pretty good not over or uncooked This was several years ago The atmosphere was welcoming and the waitress was very attentive and helpful I have visited other Applebee s locations with the same positive experience 
as5ft0ZPxkMyEfRvLBmouQ CMU I just don t get this place Overpriced for the less than mediocre food Have lived in town for over 15 years Just stopped by the other day with my wife to try and give another try after being very disappointed years ago I had the Burger for lunch the one that they claim is the best Burger in Princeton since 1965 If this is the best Burger in town I m not eating out any more it was far below average My wife had the crepes Well one would expect a Pancake House to know the difference between a thin pancake and a crepe made with real crepe batter The thin pancake was a thin pancake and NOT a crepe We tried to give it another shot but were again disappointed And what s with the lines out the door folks there are plenty of other places in town 
Asf81YqyWU7moR8nPUX8fw CMU You can feed an entire village of indigenous people with one large hoagie I would stop at this place every time I m in the area and you should too 
aTDepFyKpWuePQW8VD-KOg CMU i grew up going to the wwp school district this was the place to go after drinking with friends although they aren t quite the same as they used to be i ll still make pit stops to this place when ever i come back the best sandwich here is the 16 bacon cheese steak cause its a classic a newer creation called the heart stop basically 16 plus egg is also recommended 
aumvXfo5gyyuPBml3TdZjQ CMU I still love Big Fish This was the first time I ve been back since my last review We went this past weekend and it was ridiculously hot that day Big Fish was the perfect spot for lunch WIth its blue ocean like decor I actually felt about 10 degrees cooler the minute we stepped inside Lunch did not disappoint We got the special that was available that day which included a crab cake salmon and shrimp rice and mixed vegetables Everything was delicious Thankfully we went on a day that wasn t crowded and we were able to enjoy a nice quiet late lunch That is until the birthday group came in There were about 10 nine year old boys and they were NOISY Totally threw off the vibe of the place Why the restaurant would allow such a boisterous group on a Sunday is beyond me As a parent why would anyone even WANT to have a child s party in a place that clearly wasn t meant for that Luckily we were leaving I felt bad for the other customers who had to endure all that racket Overall still a very good lunch 
aVPLov0Hu-JFqEPWJxVlmQ CMU 2 5 Stars toward 3 I visited this place several times for lunch dinner and happy hour Not sure if it still exists For the price they charge the food was forgettable They were too salty In my first visit I got paella which was too salty In my second visit I got fish and chip which was pretty bland The happy hour menu was alright but the portion was too small it s discounted appetizer Also I saw a couple of diners during my visit that were complaining about not getting their food forever Seemed like a persistent problem they have I think the ambience was ok but that was it 
AvuD-Q3XnuVWVy5eBfisDg CMU This place was not like what people had cracked it up to be I can t begin to name the number of things that were wrong but here is a short list There isn t seating so don t plan on enjoying your meal as soon as you get it 2 they don t accept cards Luckily I had cash because if I wouldn t have I would have been pissed to have to withdraw from the ATM that s situated at the entrance 3 they were trying so hard to get me out of there that they didn t put anything on my sandwich All in all the sandwiches that my partner and I got were okay Still nothing to talk about and certainly nothing to go back for 
aw32BLVxOpdT1gVdeMD8JA CMU I ve recently read some negative comments about this place but my husband and I decided to ignore them and went to PJ s Pancake House for breakfast this morning I wish I could comment on the food but it never showed up When we arrived we were quickly seated and a nice enough waiter took our order For 45 minutes we watched everyone else in the place even people who had arrived after us being served Our order of pancakes and eggs never arrived We called a waiter over to see what the hold up was and he said he would look into it Ten minutes later he came back with our waiter and they both claimed that they had no idea what was taking so long We asked to speak to a manager and were told that he wasn t there and that no one was in charge At this point we decided that we d had enough and left Next time we ll stick to IHOP 
Aw3cyeZF9ABoeccMltakQA CMU I find many of these chain restuarants to be hit or miss but I must say Ruby Tuesday continues to reinvent themselves The salad bar has a large selection and always looks inviting The dishes are fairly priced and the selection is vast Their burgers are really tasty and go well with their fresh home lemonade 
aWzjeKv6kYk7O6W7_YF91w CMU I ve giving this one a 2 star only because there was the strangest smell inside the restaurant My friend and I really wanted to eat on the patio outside but came during the lunch rush and it was too long of a wait for us The food was pretty good but nothing spectacular as was the service I d go back to eat outside but not to sit inside 
axbz9xl3kcLIdjblGD8heg CMU My son and I visited on a weekday evening when there was no line there usually is I had one of their pasta dishes and he had a quesadilla I was quite surprised at how good they tasted The pasta was on a par with finer restaurants However where PJ s falls down is on service and price My pasta was under the heating lamps for eight minutes because the quesadilla was not prepared promptly The waiter noticed I was watching my plate being warmed and wisely took it back to the kitchen He said they re cooked it I feel the prices they charge for all their dishes are several dollars above where they should be While the food is excellent the atmosphere and service are not making their prices unreasonable 
ayDwNHSCSyqqbCF2SLM1Dw CMU I like PJ s Pancake House in Princeton NJ but it s certainly overhyped I mean I m not even really a big fan of their pancakes What I am a big fan of however are their sticky buns Oh my gawd The yre amazing Each one is sliced in half and grilled in what must be a pound of butter just kidding I think The butter carmelizes the cinnamon sugar from the sticky bun and then well it s on baby It s on But forget going on the weekend in the morning Unless you get up at the crack of dawn or enjoy waiting and waiting in line It gets REALLY crowded And according to a few of your fellow Yelpers they don t take reservations that sucks But man those sticky buns rock 
ayYFzm3og91tsB37iX598w CMU So good Our server Heather was great She was super friendly and very attentive even w multiple tables Try the caesar over misquite It s different but good It s a little pricey but we used a buy one entree get one entree from their facebook page and saved 30 
B2HmbChd1UGgQUfmzym2BA CMU great food and a historic background if you ever go to princeton be sure to stop by the sandwiches come in so many varieties and are complimented so well with great bread the late hours are also great to fulfill that late night hunger 
B2_2Zp31E-t1BGxr-ZCFXQ CMU The best food princeton has Its just incredible Any person who walks into Hoagie Haven will come out with their mouth watering ready to eat their delicious hoagie on the few benches out in front of the college food shops You can t just get half a sandwich because that would only give you half a sandwich and no one would want that It is also not recommended that anyone whose watching their cholesterol should walk in Heartstop is one of their best sandwiches anybody who is anybody who happens to be in Princeton at lunch needs to stop by and try any of their incredible subs 
B3woFmfJZhVGZ5_4MiJkxQ CMU I used to live in Princeton and was really looking forward to pancakes at PJ s when i went back there on business I ordered the classic pancakes and they were just ok and a little soggy It took forever to get service and it wasn t particularly friendly and no respectable pancake place serves corn syrup You have to pay an extra 2 50 for real maple syrup to already overpriced average pancakes Too bad because they used to be my favorite 
B4NRYWT3MdqcBzOyncLo7Q CMU cant live without cant do it wont do it mike singletary i never met anybody who did not like hoagie haven their staff is hilarious and if u go at night time u get to listen to house music greek style and watch kosta dance 
b5BeIGVOcLO7Alkr-031Bw CMU Awful Dirty utensils dirty floors food crusted salt and pepper shakers sticky ketchup bottles greasy plates lipstick stain on my coffee mug Can t believe so so many rave over this place Never going back 
BAaL_7D-2YDQEPnsyyt9jQ CMU So I guess I ll go ahead and write the review I should have written a few weeks ago after a lame experience at PJ s breakfast something something Here are a couple of noteworthy aspects to this joint that need to be called out for being totally weak 1 Server was painfully slow He had no business in a place that s trying to flip tables in 20 30 minutes 2 Milkshakes reminded me of the ovaltine my grandfather used to drink basically milk with chocolate flavor Which is fine if I was 12 No longer the case and I expect some thickness to my milkshakes 3 The oil used to cook the eggs has an off taste so the eggs have an off tase as well 4 When I complained about the fact that it was the worst attempt at a milkshake that I had seen in a restaurant the server told me that the guy at the cash register would do something about it Well I told the guy that he needed to work on his milkshakes because we really didn t enjoy them He said huh and gave me my overpriced bill So I say huh about this place You would do better eating somewhere else imo 
bBdWtPMkq-81bWZCizB6Vg CMU I m always waiting in line and I ve always wanted to carve my initials in those tables The last time I went I actually got a burger and it was goood Except the loser behind me didn t giveme much space to sit in one of those booth things so there was like an inch left between me and the table so much for my happy ending 
BBLEvgg-dUCfre023LIurA CMU This is my favorite of the chain restaurants The salad bar is by far my favorite thing about this place Zucchini burgers with fries were pretty good The fries were nice and hot The mini burgers are a little messy and greasy but didn t taste bad I m pretty sure you re supposed to get mini biscuits with the meals and we didn t receive any The waitress took a while to bring us refills for water I didn t have any water by the end of my meal and she didn t stop by until we wanted to order dessert Not a horrible waitress but not as attentive as I would have liked Clean not spotless but good enough Hostess was nice If I am ever in the area I will visit again It does have outside seating which is a plus for me And it has curb side 
bCvscMs6mDhl2kBKWXxZtQ CMU I m reading the reviews and would never have imagined that the cheesesteaks were actually that good When I went I had the sausage and pepper sub ironic given this place s name and it was pretty good It might sound redundant to say this but the food was hot since it was straight off the grill I ve had stuff that wasn t hot straight off the grill The peppers were sweet almost suspiciously so The only thing I have against the place is that there s nowhere to sit except a solitary bench outside which is tough when it gets cold out Other than that it s a good sub shop 
bE0qfK0USGKqSK_R_6YNFA CMU We love A B Great pub scene Best to get bar food ESP Wings we order the extra crispy amazing fries and O rings My favorites are the spicy chicken sandwich portobello stack cheesesteak salad Never a problem w service Love Wendy the hostess 
BGOUbG55CQ4L6kg1NknJJA CMU If I could I would give this less than one star When my husband and I visited this restaurant for the first and only time we found the service to be terrible and the food mediocre at best I remember that I was drinking an unsweetened iced tea and when I asked the waiter for a refill after waiting about 20 minutes for him to emerge from whatever hole he had temporarily crawled into he brought over a pitcher and poured diet coke into my iced tea 
bh2THL0psOV9QgCT2e-Arw CMU Gross overcooked tuna sliders slick fries bad service that rushes you even when there are no waiting customers and you re still eating Don t even think about darkening the doors of this strictly average brew pub unless you are the finest university upper crust visiting parents ok if sporting Chanel Gucci or YSL 
bIdZnHM2Mlp4xPqAatftbQ CMU Fish did not taste fresh muscles were over done The drinks were just OK Waste of money and waste of time Another disappointment in the Princeton area 
bKogA8sfpmCsmI9PitiJgQ CMU I grew up in Princeton and Hoagie Haven was the place to gather late Friday nights with the gang and scarf down cheese steaks that were out of this world My folks still live there so I get back frequently and every time I do I stop by the Haven order one of those cheese steaks loaded with fried onions lettuce tomatoes and more and am instantly transported right back to high school right from the first bite Hoagie Haven is virtually an institution in Princeton and the lines still from out the door for their amazing food Wish they d open an outpost in Santa Fe 
blrhSTD-uR_ixzUYqJg-eA CMU My wife and I had lunch out on the patio to take advantage of a lovely warm autumn day The newly renovated patio is beautiful so that was definitely a highlight of our meal Unfortunately we were disappointed with our food The menu seems to revamped in an upscale direction we ve been to Tap Room before for beers back when they used to give out free popcorn All the salads seemed very impressive I chose the cranberry chicken and my wife the beet salad They were about 12 each We were offered some complimentary buns with a tasty garlic pepper olive oil We devoured them When the salads came we both found the quality of lettuces and greens to be wanting I had to pick away some of the leaves that had wilted and were turning to green mush The salads were large and filling but mid to low quality ingredients and lack of attention to balance made them much less impressive than the menu suggests We will not order salads from the Tap Room again Though it was enjoyable to sit outside some extra time it did take the server quite a while to give us our bill and we did have to ask twice The service was fine but a little more attentiveness would have been appreciated I think the Tap Room has some ways to go to arrive at gastro pub from pub 
Bmy-5XAO0vr-o4xFAlVoZg CMU I review this establishment in honor of a Valentines Day Dinner I had a few years ago at this fine restaurant The service was fantastic the food tasted good the desserts were scrumptious A few hours later my then girlfriend contacts me and tells me she s extremely sick probably food poisoning I tell her I think I m ok only to find myself running towards the bathroom shortly after that conversation Yup Food Poisoning So why the A ok decent rating Well in a weird way I guess I thank blame but mostly thank A B for making me realize that this relationship wasn t working out How so Love should overcome all Even food poisoning 
bnmb3CIb53Hj1-37dGivaw CMU Well there is just no denying it Salt Creek Grille is a fun place to go Last night my hubby and I took out a few of our employees for some drinks and food We had to work a bit late and one of our employees David was celebrating his 28th birthday Anyway the music was great the food and service was wonderful and you just can t beat the warm cozy atmosphere of all those fireplaces Lucky me that Salt Creek is a block from my Princeton shop I never need much of an excuse to go for a drink and some snacks 
bNsMMVMCojQiBsXSvub4Yw CMU If you are looking for cheap beer lowbrow crowd girls with big BMI you will fit right in If you are looking to hook up with good looking people I do not think that there is a place in town for you Drive up to New York This place is what NJ is all about 
bO1HZydxHxwu0aZ0gZJpDg CMU Amazing sandwiches Amazing prices Extremely quick And delicious 
BoyDui-2myTqm9eQNG7daQ CMU While visiting NY my friend and i made a trip to Princeton and the destination was Hoagie Haven not the university I didnt believe the hype but i went along with it I had the chicken parm and was an instant believer That thing was the best chicken sandwhich i ve ever eaten Hot and crispy i can still taste it Im jealous of you guys in NJ 
Bpv9WGrlx9pZ5CZJqhFOiw CMU Came here while visiting Princeton from out of town Two overworked bartenders for the entire place on a Friday night while a hostess and a couple of servers milled about doing nothing at the hostess table They told us we couldn t sit at one of the dozens of empty tables though It took forever to get a drink and pretty much every patron was rudely and irritatedly jockeying for space at the bar No thanks Next time I m in town I ll go somewhere else 
bR7lz25qByPVej5D3dmr_w CMU I was not impressed today at lunch I started with the ribollita which was something like a rustic minestre with a couple of croutons not authentic My wife had the BLT chopped salad which was OK She had the Arctic Char as her entree The fish itself was fine as was the sauce but it came with some mushrooms which were too tough to chew I had the fish and chips which came with house made potato chips and multi colored slaw The slaw was the nicest thing on the plate The potato chips were OK but under seasoned Fish was tender but under seasoned and fried until barely colored Decor is nice enough only vaguely Euro bistro Quite a large room I would guess 30 40 tables Busy at lunch today Somewhat noisy I could not hear the background music Glass top tables paper napkins Service was OK but the servers are mostly young and not very deft Friendly Prices are moderate most entrees are under 20 Nine taps at the bar I had the Flying Fish Oktoberfish which was barely chilled and flat I prefer Camillo s Cafe in the same shopping center 
BsmOUGK-lXHnigqRZgPV1Q CMU Food is decent Service is an atrocity We waited for 15 min for a table when it wasn t that busy and had to ask for refills on our coffee multiple times before we actually got them My sandwich was okay although the portion was rather small for the price The fries were crispy and hot though The breakfast options are usually pretty good but do tend to be on the pricey side We asked for separate checks but they forgot and would only split the check evenly because they were busy Not that big of a deal but still a bit annoying I mean you did agree to give us separate checkswhen we first asked I would just head down the street to PJ s 
bsqNB6QHcbBBYSuzDViDOg CMU Five stars nuff said 
bt6DNIZBbADkWyCnygW7ng CMU Good food and great location I really enjoyed the Princeton athletic attire around the restaurant I came on a Sunday night but looking from the walls of the bar area there are some great specials on Tuesday or Monday nights Nothing AMAZING but this is a great place to sit down and have dinner 
bT8xjL7acjrZ4kLvy2YdbA CMU The food wasn t bad and even though we had to make reservations the place was half empty We had burgers fish and fries The guinness beer was not very fresh The service was very slow even thought there was only 3 tables with customers Food wasn t bad but very overpriced for the quantity served We have had better We will not go back 
bVw_7dpXBuHzI-UZgP8T2Q CMU Picked this place to eat because the location was convenient the name was kind of cool and we were in the mood for Guinness and burgers as opposed to anything swishier One thing i noticed before we even got inside was that a number of dishes mentioned in previous reviews such as empanadas and Captains Drunken Shrimp didn t appear to be on the menu anymore instead it was pretty much burgers fries nachos stew and shepherd s pie I was also secretly hoping it would be sort of like the Tombs at Georgetown where I drank a year or so of my bright college days away I wasn t disappointed in that regard Got there at 6 30 on a Saturday in February found there was a half hour wait for a table for 2 Decided to hang around drink a beer in the overcrowded bar every seat taken no place to sit and people were literally standing in the entryways the halls anyplace they could find a spot This turned out to be the right move since by the time we got seated which was indeed 30 40 minutes later the wait was apparently up to an hour This place is nice and all but the level of business was astounding We were happy to get a table in the bar which is cozy and noisy as you d expect and looks basically like an old college Irish pub type bar as opposed to the patio area which is sheathed in plastic looked drafty and definitely lacking in charm and character They had so many tables jammed into the bar area we were practically sitting in the lap of the people next to us but every table was full full full No recession here folks Extensive beer list and they were only out of one beer we ordered so that was OK Husband asked for his burger medium and it actually came more like medium rare pink inside but he was a good sport and ate it anyway The crispy fries were excellent The nachos were good although very untraditional they use some kind of tortilla chip dusted with spicy stuff rather than plain chips then put black beans red beans garbanzo beans a couple kinds of cheese olives hot very hot peppers chicken and andouille sausage on them and then put not only the sour cream on the side I d expect that but also a tiny cup of salsa which I d normally expect to just see on the nachos They were good though I did not like the dusted chips but I liked everything else about the dish Our waitress was terribly young and terribly overworked and still did pretty OK by us We noticed her spilling water in the lap of the lady next to us but I thought she deserved forgiveness because the tables were so close together the poor girl had about 8 inches to manuever her tray between our table and the other folks It would be a difficult situation for even an experienced wait staff This place lived up to my expectations which admittedly weren t that high Given the land office business it is doing I think some entrepreneur should open up another similar joint in the neighborhood which seems to be heavy on fancier and pricier restaurants 
bw5PzocUkLKALLbFQNdtDw CMU This place don t mess around If full thick HEARTY sandwiches are what you crave then you ve come to the right place I ordered the Body Bag sandwich and let me tell ya it certainly didn t pull any punches The hoagie was toasted to perfection and the megaton of ingredients and all the delicious grease delivered a heavy roundhouse to my taste buds I should mention that I ordered the half size and it was more than enough to satisfy In addition to the sandwich I also ordered a side of Buffalo Fries I was somewhat disappointed in the fries as it was simply bulk fries topped with hot sauce and ranch Considering the effort that they placed into the sandwiches I d like to see the same done with the fries The service is no nonsense and efficient and given the size of the sandwich the price is certainly reasonable One final note is that while I rate this place a 4 from what I ve heard from students the sandwiches taste that much better after a night of drinking As such it s safe to say the rating under those circumstances would be an easy 5 Take that for what it s worth 
bxpZooWtJ3zzFYX7T9g-Aw CMU Went again when a guest was in town and wanted brunch We went during the week so it was less crowded Still busy but not out of control busy I found it to be better this time but still not great The coffee should definitely be better brunch is a meal where you linger and if I m going to linger I really want to enjoy my coffee Perhaps this is their plan to avoid lingering on busy mornings Hmm The rest of my meal this time was fine The service was fine 
bY-a-MMmrYtoJmAHJs2zMw CMU I get the chicken parm sub with lettuce mayo and bbq sauce Don t knock it till you try it this place is inappropriately delicious 
bykxLAUjfkMSEp05ky-jSQ CMU I think this restaurant had its glory days a long time ago I had lunch in the bar at the back of the restaurant which sort of reminded me of the bar from Cheers It was cozy and seemed like a good place to hang out over drinks At the recommendation of the waitress I got the grilled chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese guacamole cillantro and chipotle aioli It was really good but too big And at 14 more than I would typically spend on a sandwich at lunch The waitress was nice and it was the sort of place where you can sit alone without feeling awkward but I think it is a bit pricey for what it is 
ByOKlkEJJlEcTA1ru9pzqw CMU keep in mind princeton nj there aren t too many places to eat out but this place has got a lot of history and the food actually wasnt bad whoever made the prices were a little outta their mind though its pricey for the kind of food they are dishing up the crowd was mixed but i can see it catering mostly to an older crowd your parents age and up prob would be a good place to take your parents if they were nice enough to drop you off and help you move into your dorm 
C4nP0TnjwTMdj1QGNnXKRQ CMU I ve been to the Salt Creek Grill 3 times and all 3 times the food and the service have been subpar I can overlook service if the food is good but the food is definitely not good I ve ordered three different items each time thinking maybe they just had an off night but this was not the case It s a shame too because this place has good ambiance minus the terrible acoustics and blasting live music from the bar area and the menu makes sense There s a good reason why this place gets so many bad reviews the food is not good and that being said it makes the prices even harder to swallow I offer two pieces of advice 1 Get rid of ALL kitchen staff and start over by hiring a new head chef An excellent chef would never allow ill prepared food to leave his her kitchen If you want to put high prices on your menu you need a chef who can execute the orders Period 2 The live music in the bar area good idea because people like live music but this music is not contained in this area as the acoustics are terrible here and spills over into the dining area to the point where you have to shout yes literally shout it s that loud across the table as if you re at a club After 10 pm fine but during dinner hours no this is not acceptable Either turn down the amps or tell these guys to show up at 10 pm 
C5I5JvFP64kZGxDr83xusA CMU I really liked this place and the owner knew my order but I had to stop going when he started charging 7 for a falafel with nothing else NOWHERE can do that and still have me pay it Boo 
c6svEgihpk784w6tl-9z2w CMU The four stars are more for the atmosphere than the food People rave about the fish tacos Stay away from them They re heavily breaded the sauce is french dressing I think in any case it s something not good and they re served with fries The burgers are fantastic I haven t tried the fancier items 
c7V17R05IFdL32KTWy-omw CMU The Tap Room is my go to place in Princeton for drinks with friends I can always find a seat in the bar area and they have a fireplace and multiple tvs The ambiance of the place feels like stepping into an old rustic ivy league bar with carvings on the walls and portraits of famous Princeton alums They have even extended their dining area onto a newly built patio in Palmer Square The big advantage of the Tap Room is that you can get pitchers unlike some of the other bars in Princeton and the fact that it is never extremely crowded like The Ivy Inn Triumph and Winberries This is one of the few bars where you can actually have a conversation without having to yell The prices are better than most of the bars in Princeton and if you follow them on facebook and twitter you can take advantage of 50 cent wings 2 pints and half price appetizer deals that they have especially during big sporting events Although I cannot comment on the food as I have mostly come just for the drinks I have had the wings which are pretty good Overall its a great place to hang out with friends in a warm relaxing atmosphere 
c8S_63yy0yTrWid4pdVIBg CMU I love their hot n cold sandwiches Second to none 
cb2wLWl7SO1GCQfEeAVs0w CMU There are probably three or four famous spots in Princeton the campus itself the battlefield Einstein s house and last but most definately not least Hoagie Haven I have two words for you Buffalo Fries They are heavenly my mouth is actually watering right now I usually go for the Italian sub or the fries but the hoagies are definately worth a try If you re feeling adventurous get a Phat Lady but please be sure to be starving when you get it because otherwise you wont come out or finish it alive The staff is super friendly and fun if you go there on a regular basis you get to know them pretty well Ordering by phone before getting there is a good idea because usually there is a long line 
CBJajcFjlhzCpCgEDcOW-w CMU Solid bar and Princeton institution Right off Palmer Square with a good selection of beers and pub grub A few televisions with the news and or the game on decent seating and workable menu Not going to steal the thunder of Ferry House Elements or Teresa s but it s a good mainstay for a quick bite and pint 
cbVEcaLdjmIuioqGn8uxzA CMU There is every kind of pancake that you can imagine here While I do thoroughly enjoy the chocolate chip pancakes I don t find them to be worth the long wait that is inevitable on weekends That being said this is a landmark so it is worth stopping by if you re visitng campus 
cdE-kq9brlov8O0QywRrJw CMU i ordered a CHICKEN CLUB I was served a CHICKEN SUB Basically a Wawa sub For 11 Seriously Not cool 2 stars 
cek-FfaxtxUpw9n-fLw3-g CMU Awesome chocolate chip pancakes End of story PJ s has been around for a long time and with good reason While the servers attitudes and demeanors can border on questionable the service is good and the staff knows their product I tend to only eat the breakfast food it s in the name but on the rare occassions I ve ordered from their normal menu I ve been nothing but pleased Their omlettes are great their pancakes are exceptional try the chocolate chip ones with strawberries on top you ll thank me the portions are ridiculously over sized think Cheesecake Factory and the turkey bacon is superb The atmospher is perfect your small town feel grafiti all over the tables makes it cozy and personable and while there is normally a wait on weekends crowding inside their narrow cramped space makes you feel oddly at home I don t know why so many complaints but I consider myself to be a breakfast expert and this my friends is the place to go 
cGwChGA4wwz7uS-OFVNhJQ CMU I wanted to love this place because I think anyone daring enough to put mozzarella sticks in a sub deserves all the love I can give him but I couldn t What should ve turned out to be spectacular in theory anyways turned out to be mediocre What should ve been fourth of july in my mouth was just another sub albeit one that s probably shortening my life by a good 5 years I ll come back if only to try the other wacky combinations but as for loving I ll probably hang on to my heart 
chdfd-RhKPK5xWZrCWfHfw CMU I don t know what type of crack the previous reviewers were smoking well I guess Michael and Jen are married so it must be the same nasty kind because my family really likes Big Fish And that s saying a lot when you have a mother that s unwilling to throw down anything more than a buck for stuff that s not Chinese or at least some form of Asian cuisine As its name implies this is a place to go for tasty fish And after the barrage of articles about how fish is good for your health my mother sure loves her fish Eh she d become an alcoholic if a study was released on how good vodka shots were for your body But I digress From their parmesan crusted tilapia to their juicy salmon they get their fish plates right The atmosphere is a bit dark but not too pretentious They definitely realize they are catering to the nice Princeton suburbs and aren t pretending to be some trendy NY eatery The prices are reasonable and the food tasty enough The fact that it has survived so long in the revolving door that is MarketFair Mall with considerable crowds every weekend night has to say something Sure I ve had better food elsewhere but I ve also paid more gone further and eaten the Filet O Fish at MickeyD s I ll stick to Big Fish when I m in town 
ci3P_t9Iy0JkDfwFPkNVhg CMU I m not surprised at the number of negative reviews given the generally snooty Princeton attitude As a non Princeton native forced to live here with my grad student spouse the Ivy is a much needed escape from the chichi overpriced and generally boring and sterile Princeton bar scene The Ivy is a dive there is no question but it is not a dirty place I mean you come here to drink and watch a game with friends It s not like they even serve food Lighten up germ freaks the Ivy is no worse than most bars All of this aside I find it to be a good place to drink a beer play trivia Tuesday nights and watch whatever sporting event you care to A plus they have Fox Soccer Network and play a good number of international football matches if that is your thing A great recent addition to the tall boys of PBR and cheap domestic drafts is the excellent locally brewed River Horse Pilsner from Lambertville NJ which along with the other more high end beers now on tap gives you the option to class it up a bit 
cIDhZOyY8X23DMAY8zI39g CMU I ve been to Salt Creek Grille a number of times in the last month The decor is great it looks like a ski lodge as others have commented I especially like the fireplace Food is good although overpriced they have a prix fixe menu that includes soup salad a choice of 3 entrees and a chef s choice desert While it is nothing exciting I like the house salad it includes yummy candied walnuts Service is very attentive the last time I was there my friend s meal wasn t prepared to order and they fixed it quickly and gave him a genuine apology The big downside of this restaurant is the acoustics it can be really loud 
CivGXkXwmbGAUnZ23CP-EA CMU The food here was pretty good and I would definitely eat there again The menu items seemed a bit expensive for what they were The only reason we tried it was because we had a very nice gift certificate which made it totally worth it The service was very good once we got seated At the bar and the host table the service was not memorable We started with teh SCG Chips which were outstanding Probably the best part of our meal We also got the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer which was pretty good I then had the Porterhouse Stroganoff and my fiancee had the filet The entrees were good but not outstanding Finally for dessert we got creme brulee which was standard and very good It was good but not great and a bit too pricey for what it is Like I said before we had a very generous gift card 
cjv14Jb60qEgrC7Kz0quJQ CMU Nice addition to the Princeton dining milieu Had a bit of an issue with the service the 2nd time we were there but we just accepted it On leaving the restaurant I imagine one of the owners asked if everything was all right and I couldn t help but say something He suggested that we should have searched him out long ago and he would have taken care of us Shouldn t have to IMO Oh really decent food reasonable prices for Princeton 
ckOz_YWj7BwqB3y5jEazOw CMU The first time I went to a Paneras I thought it was just another upscale Princetony type eateries I was really surprised to find out that it was actually a chain Panera is not at all what I expected from a chain good food fresh ingredients and soup that was not too hot or not too cold what a treat I d love to know how they get it at exactly the right temperature every time I recommend the Sierra turkey sandwich tasty turkey with a great sauce fresh lettuce and onion and cheese baked right into the bread I also love the french onion soup its thicker and more savory than most soups I ve had I can t say I ve ever had bad service there but then again I ve never had my order placed incorrectly or anything like that Occasionally I get someone who takes my order that is not especially friendly but I get that in a lot of places I m usually handed my food with a smile which is always appreciated One time they forgot to put cheese in my soup but thats a minor detail and the soup is better without it my opinion The place can get EXTREMELY busy during lunch on any day and dinner on the weekends where things get a little slow and the main seating area gets noisy and crowded But my solution to that is there is a little seating area right next to the bakery area that is usually never crowded and is significantly less noisy Even if the restaurant isn t busy its a nice cozy nook too eat in peace just my little secret that might help all you yelpers out there enjoy your lunch a little more Oh and the outside eating area is GREAT on sunny days 
ckwScHxB5Lqc5yHHiBavxQ CMU This is my second visit to Salt Creek Grill The first time I have to say I was not a fan The atmosphere was very loud and the food was average I was back July 19 2010 I have to say it was a much better experience I had a gift card so I was ready It was 1 2 price bottle of wine great deal and a good variety We had the calamari app It was cooked very well and tasty The meals we also cooked well and quite tasty The atmosphere is still a bit loud 
Clk98JbsJqbmB0hwVu4tmQ CMU After reading about fat sandwiches I was excited to find that I could get one without having to drive up to Rutgers I was also excited to find out at you can get a 1 2 hoagie instead of a whole I think I would have died It is located off a happening street in Princeton So it s definitely a typical college joint A lot selections and unfortunately cash only for people who don t usually carry cash There is an on site ATM so no worries there So deciding which hoagie to get I ended up getting the Sanchez I did not get it extra dirty since it looked like the guy poured a lot of sauce It was a nice night so I sat outside to eat It is definitely messy so I was lucky enough to only get a drop of sauce on my shirt How was it I thought it was ok I mean it s really just a bunch of fried food stuffed into bread with cheese and sauce I could also be that I don t eat food like this so my stomach just wasn t having it At one point I got tired of chewing so I ate each ingredient individually The chicken fingers were nice and crispy The mozarella sticks were actually really bad by itself Barely fried crisp with the cheese having the texture of fake chicken nuggets The fries were just fries I m glad to have tried it but now I know it is definitely not my type of hoagie I would be willing to try something else 
clPnzMIjdOJN6s_TUBvrHg CMU By far the best food in Princeton for the money and one of the top five places even if money is not a consideration Cheesesteak egg mayo is delicious 
cOQhhJIdCOiLkEv6eOBXoA CMU Like all other TGIF s this Friday s has slow service While their waiters and waitresses are extremely friendly and welcoming the wait time drives me insane every time and I ve been coming here for 7 years Nothing is overpriced and nothing is spectacular except the Classic Wedge Salad I find that in the past decade the quality of TGIF has really gone down hill The mac cheese mashed potatoes and tortilla chips tastes completely different and might I add bad And there is no more complimentary bread I will certainly not be eating here no matter how many 2 for 10 deals they throw at me 
CQyl7s8snH--7ASpSYpqHA CMU Went to Friday s twice to get some happy hour food and drinks and I m glad I waited until after the second time to post this My first trip the beer was cheap and the food was decent and the service was average as expected The second time we went the beer was still cheap the food was still ok but the service was terrible Took 45 minutes to get our first drink an hour to get our apps and then we were charged for an extra app we didn t get so it took another 20 minutes just to fix our bill Friday s is more expensive than similar restaurants so I would have hoped for better 
CrQ0FW679rD3hYAtxUOIrQ CMU this place used to be the best restaurant in princeton about 10 12 yrs ago now it is a rundown old dump with ok food and poor service dont bother with the place 
CWNjJfKiEZz9gJezpEN1vg CMU Perfect for late night dining on the cheap No seating except for some benches outside but that s part of the charm If you wear your Hoagie Haven t shirt there I think they give you a discount on a soda or something 
CwYkUXMb1Gj-FN95TVkNLw CMU When it comes to grease it gets no better than Haven While all the traditional sandwiches are great chicken parm chicken cheesesteak etc the holy grail are the BUFFALO FRIES Just typing the words induces a Pavlovian response A hand held heart attack these crisp tasty delights come drenched in blue cheese hot sauce It was love at first bite senior year of high school these fries became my primary food group for the rest of my Princeton days I haven t found a fry as satisfying since not for lack of effort on my part 
CX8NPWFT5nolbfFRDxncoQ CMU Ehh I end up there every once in a while because it s the only burger type joint around me but I never leave happy Food isn t that good it s loud to a fault clientele is a bit too rough around the edges for me 
d0DHsqz6Sk5C4OtJ2HfKQg CMU Pancakes can only be so good Its a limited cuisine But the variety of the pancakes served at PJ s is impressive If there is no crowd as when I ve gone during summer at unspeakable hours of the morning the service is impeccable the atmosphere nostalgia inducing and the pancakes as fresh and buttery as a pancake can be 
d3irqMaCfeBOTtna-MYKsg CMU Hoagie Haven may be the perfect dining experience There are no pretenses just an honest and delicious sandwich I have been going to the Haven for about 25 years and in all that time I have yet to be disappointed Then menu is varied and full of fantastic combinations I tend to the tuna or 1 but when the occasion warrants the omelet hoagie can serve to replenish even the weariest of souls For me the way to enjoy their offerings is go at an off hour when the lines are not too long then take the short walk to the Woodrow Wilson building on the Princeton campus and sit at the fountain for some people watching and face stuffing I truly treasure the one to one relationship between patron and sandwich constructor The junior constructors are overseen by a tough but fair overlord whose charter is to keep the purity and proper proportions of each creation to the Haven s time honored standards There is nothing like a place with good food and a staff that is dedicated to serving a great product 
d40B2jch2JyNscnOBVaFkw CMU Sat at the bar and had a few drinks and an appetizer The drinks were cheap but not too strong However the BBQ Shrimp Embrochette was amazing If it s a sign of their food quality I might just have to go back It was bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cheese and served with an amazing tomatillo bbq sauce Maybe one of the best appetizers I ve had anywhere 
d6CALzeOZuh3R0kN3GJPpg CMU I kind of can t believe I m reviewing a chain restaurant much less TGI Friday s Also that I m giving it such a high rating That said this review is mostly for the bar Somehow the bar at Friday s inside Princeton Market Fair is much more hoppin and fun on a weeknight than Triumph or the Ivy who would have known Super cheap happy hour from 10 to close can t be beat seriously strong 4 mixed drinks and the bartenders specifically the two girls that seem to be there all the time are attentive nice and remember your drink orders from visit to visit I m not going to say anything about the food because dude it s Friday s but if you re looking for something to do in sleepy Central Jersey on a late weekday night you definitely won t be disappointed or sober after hitting this place 
DCSvLHs89SU8bEXPseWpFg CMU Considering the lines we expected something incredible Unfortunately it was like Ye Olde Egg Shoppe in N California I guess that Thursday is recycling day out front we spotted boxes of Superiour Buttermilk Pancake Mix on other occasions the delivery truck unpacking the crates of INSTANT pancake mix Hungry we went in Seated promptly at The Table of Awesome Coffee was standard diner fare medium weak Jim got the 2 fer 2 eggs 2 bacon 2 pancakes 1 sausage I m rather averse to pancake mix but his response was what do you actually expect some place to make pancakes from scratch Uh yeah Particularly if it has Pancake in the name I had eggs over easy with the mush potatoes cheddar onions soy sauce possibly chives It was as expected and perfect for my post move hangover The most unpleasant part was the hand dangling over my seat a 60ish guy with longer fingernails and leather biker bracelets I pretended to stab him with my knife to amuse myself lest I be sickened by the hand dangling over my chair Price 25 w o tip If you want to go to a place which is like the ugly fat chick who s popular simply because she s blonde this is your place regarding the institution comments hospitals and prisons are also institutions with this having a far better review http tinyurl com lnfern if the link doesn t work use google maps to search for State of New Jersey Department of Corrections Northern State Prison 
ddWquGqhImk5jkMG69nNQw CMU The Ivy is basically the definition of a dive bar Sketchy crowd at times ridiculous music which ends up being fun after a few 1 Miller High Life pints and it can take forever to get the attention of a bartender However it s still a good go to place if you re looking to people watch hang out with friends and drink very cheap brew 
dHgm7BuMFI4YztGoAYjpeg CMU If you re looking for a real world soupnazi experience get in line This is the real deal Sitting here in Seattle and contemplating an upcoming trip east this among other delights is on my mind Mine Simple Tuna with pepperocini an lettuce italian dressing salt pepper stop me i feel faint the bread you can not begin to imagine if you ve not been well precisely there fries oh my god eggplant parm hoagie though the line is long you d do well to stand aside and watch the flow before stepping in The pace is beyond swift and the ordering is precise you will want to grab all the necessary sides drinks whatever napkins so you can just hunker down on the stoop or jet over to the campus for a little picnic your belly will be oh so happy you will go back tomorrow even in the face of hoagies again protests from the uninitiated 
DHy7lTrTafGiYrMWA_m7ow CMU There is a sign near the fryers that says Best hamburgers in the world It s the truth Salt pepper ketchup Yes please 
dhyYGLGvTrqu_cSSuYp1_w CMU I used to love eating at this place when I lived in Mercer County Waiting on line with the sun beating down on me was not an issue I moved to Voorhees and haven t eaten at this place for some time I decided to visit the establishment last month and was extremely disappointed I was able to overlook the gum under the table for years due to the great service and great food This place has gone down the tubes The placed smelled like dirty dish water The Service was extremely horrible and no one seems to give a damn Don t think I will be making any specials trip up to Mercer County on the weekend to visit one of my favorite places If you want a good breakfast on a Sunday K C Prime 
DJD9t4Ftp2HViGF6lKUNrA CMU Heavenly I know that Philly is known the world over for their cheesesteaks but Hoagie Haven truly cannot be beat This place is a MUST for anyone visiting the Lawrenceville Princeton area The sandwiches are to die for from the regular cheesesteak to one of their hot or cold signature sandwiches I ve been eating here for the past 20 years Every time I am in the area I have to make my pilgrimage here and have a cheesesteak no ifs ands or buts about it Very affordable but get there either a little bit before lunch or a little after lunch because the line gets LONG and often out the door 
dKrvn1CLfJTmhm9GU60J-Q CMU We ve gone here several times since moving to the area I d say about half the time we ve had good food decent service and the other half the food is ok but the service is terrible Once or twice we ve had to really work to flag down waitresses who seem either overwhelmed or just indifferent hard to tell but at least it wasn t flat out rude It seems to be getting worse though it was better when we went last year and recently hasn t seemed as good 
dp2rapoEyjIFBetN79R_sg CMU My wife loves this place The fish is fresh Menu selection is small They used to serve a sashimi style Ahi tuna dish that I used to love but they don t offer it anymore That s a bummer for me Quantity is good and food is tasty but I think the place is over priced 
dpmgth4-lwFQEzblGgtqqg CMU We ve passed by this place numerous times over the past year and there was always smoke coming out the back BBQ So we stopped in for a light lunch today Basically this is what TGIF or the other places want to be an authentic local sports bar with food and friendly people who don t need flair Music is the typical classic rock setting is dark wood with old signs and mirrors a decent selection of beers on tap not stupendous but decent and an extensive bar like menu From the seasonal beer selections I chose Honey Moon and Jim got a light tasting but dark Flying Fish The Honey Moon was very light and the Flying fish slightly chocolately but watery it was hot and muggy today so they were actually perfect Way too many items on the menu so I settled for the cajun wings and Jim got the half slab of ribs which came with salad huge your choice with or without salad shrimp and chopped hardboiled eggs The salad was great I usually hate salad shrimp but here they had been thawed properly and actually tasted like sweet shrimp not paste The cajun wings were a bit greasy for me but they ll be great in tomorrow s chicken salad Not at all salty but blackened The seasoning didn t do much for them I hate to say The ribs were tender not fall off the bone but tender Good pig flavour The sauce tasted like Heinz 57 Sauce A familiar taste that is good if that is what you like Corn bread was more cake like Applesauce as expected and fries good I regret not ordering the boardwalk fries or whatever their name for it is battered and fried fries served with cheese sauce I m not pregnant as far as I know but these I ve been craving And I m not even a beachgoer They simply sounded really good Friendly service decent food and atmosphere With 2 beers an appetizer 1 glass of wine and half order of ribs 49 including tax and tip 
DqMZTPFflBEWIrblcCm-_Q CMU Overpriced and not that great Don t know why there is always a long line Go to Bagel Street Grill instead 
Dq_jp7X-kRjCYsVQdb3f3A CMU I came here for lunch with some family that lives around the Princeton area I don t think of great food when I think of Princeton but that s what I got when I ate at the Alchemist Barrister I had the chile marinated chicken sandwich or something of a similar name It was delicious One of the best chicken sandwiches I ve ever had The chicken was moist and the avocado guacamole stuff on it was super good The fries were darn tasty too My brother got the tiger burger and he thought it was so good he actually said that it might be the best burger he d ever had He really liked the tiger sauce My brother as well as most other guys I know loves burgers so he wasn t joking around when he said it tops his list of best burgers I also got the raspberry sangria and my mom and aunt got the white peach sangria and they both loved theirs Mine was pretty good better than most others I ve tried but I definitely think the white peach is the way to go here I don t understand the less than stellar reviews but I came for lunch so maybe it s different during the evening drinking hours Anyway I thought the food was really good and it got the thumbs up from my brother too so check it out at least for lunch 
DRnDWmvV5_muS0_9vKVUTw CMU Hoagie Haven is great They are cash only so don t forget Prices are reasonable and food is delicious I ve been going here since I was a kid love it 
dT6O-HzC5oPoXwBsAK_-wA CMU 7 for a giant hoagie with the works Don t forget the peppers 
dthcy2rvkkYevGnd998ZNA CMU Went for the 1st time today I think you nice folks giving this place 2 stars or less either don t have taste buds or consider the cost of McDonald s a huge night out I had the romaine caeser salad and the fish tacos Both were above average The fish tacos themselves were great The rice and beans that came with it were bland Bland dropped this to a 3 star from a 4 1 star No 2 stars Debatable but no Service was very good Ambiance was solid I ll be back and will probably question the taste buds of the 2 star folks again 
DvGSYVWN47V7ZQKymKuLfg CMU I love this place Especially Steve at the bar Make sure you ask for the off menu drunken clams One of the best burgers around for sure Just make sure you get there early or late after dinner as it gets packed Also check it out for St Patty s day party Good times and great people you also get free popcorn at the bar lots of TV s for the games too I just wish they would bring back Yuengs and Wings on Thursdays 
dvh47_vrYIUxSqV6FVZ2tw CMU We dropped in to PJ s on a weekday morning while we were just passing through from Maine to Memphis When we entered we found there was a small line which amounted to a fifteen minute wait unless we wanted to be seated at a group table instead of a private booth The host was extremely nice and patient and the other people waiting in line with us some of them also out of towners were equally friendly and chatty I overheard as we were waiting that the line is frequently out the door so we were thankful for such a short wait We were seated at a booth toward the back and served swiftly by a waitress who was nice but no nonsense In a place as busy as PJ s they seemed to operate like a well oiled machine I ordered the eggs with mashed browns and my partner ordered the pancake sampler The mashed browns are delicious and are a must if you ever visit My partner and I were a little perplexed by the low reviews for the place but the reason for this became quickly apparent when we had settled in to our meal and began overhearing the conversations of the other patrons around us Every single person seated around us was complaining complaining about the food about the dog walker about the maid Our impression of Princeton from the 16 or so hours we spent there was that it was a place of extreme privilege There was a fairly large cross section of people we encountered that were stuck up and entitled perhaps as evenly as the number of people who were lovely and kind tldr PJ s was a wonderful place to have brunch and I definitely recommend it Princeton on the other hand not so much 
dWeJEZNimsjvfyRRrcsXcA CMU I wasn t going to bother writing this place up since I m rarely in Princeton NJ but felt my experience should be known The place itself is a huge cavern vaulted ceiling with a nod to the western style lodges in National Parks and Rocky Mountain enclaves It definitely feels impressive when you first walk in past the semi outdoor fireplace We immediately got a table in the main dining room on a Saturday night but our conversation was brief between the rocking band playing soul and R B covers for the bar crowd at a decibel non conducive to casual dining The place was pricey but to be expected if you re serving really tasty food I wasn t super hungry and opted for the wild mushroom burger 12 so I could get a lobster bisque soup 8 and still be in a reasonable price zone Many appetizers were at 15 The recommended double cut pork chop entree was 25 and steaks were hovering around 34 I also was not drinking so I can t comment on alcohol prices Most of the wine selection was from the California corporate vineyards like Ravenswood or Mondavi etc The table ordered a calamari appetizer which was ok but the breading was falling off and a little underdone in the deep fryer My bisque arrived and it was fishy tasting Not delicious lobster fishy tasting A little overwhelming fishy tasting and I kind of knew what we were getting into then My burger arrived and it was cooked correctly but it was dry and not juicy It kind of fell apart in squares around the edges The potato roll bun was a bit hard and glazed but not in a crusty way And there really wasn t any mushrooms It was mostly these oil soggy caramelized onions on the topping and the tomatoes were super hard In short it was really really expensive diner food And I ve been to diners that do it better for a third of the price And I feel bad saying that because the space itself was pretty cool in that modern lodge kind of way I wasn t expecting the greatest food ever but I was expecting a tasty burger I guess if you re charging these prices you would expect something better than food service style cafeteria quality and something locally purveyed But then I found out it s a chain So there you go Others at the table were pleased with the fish sole and the pork chop While the steak sandwich and two burgers were squarely dismissed The rating is really food based The service was fine and I m sure it s an okay place for a drink but I can t look past my dreadful meal for that price The service and environment get a star 
DX7k1IWWRkSXVa5FtRxVLg CMU We had to return later that night thursday around 11pm because when we came here around 8pm they had a bikini contest and the place was packed with drunk old men and we couldn t get a table It was me and another female friend We came here for the wings and beer They have everyday special of coors light pitcher for 7 89 We got an order of that and 10 piece of the buffalo wings for 10 95 you can pick how spicy you want it and we got hot I found that it was kind of ridiculous they charged another 2 dollars for a side of celery sticks and blue cheese dressing The wings were good breaded and seasoned well I eat very spicy so I didn t find the wings very spicy that I had to add Tabasco sauce on top of that The service was really just okay Given that the waitresses were all girls and it was me and my female friend of course they were not going to be very friendly with us But overall not a bad place just don t come here on a bikini night or else you will be surrounded by creepy weird guys and won t be able to get a table 
Dxo-XcemK22Tam8E1yaATQ CMU How is this place in Princeton Everywhere else with a liquor license uses it more wisely here It s a trashy Jersey bar and manages to attract every single person that will ever start a fight to its parking lot Every Single Weekend Also at closing time the line at Haven becomes ridiculous and makes my delicious sandwich that much harder to get Oh yeah the police love to park right outside this bar and follow people going out of it to catch them doing a DUI Makes Nassau St that much more obnoxious for everyone living here 
d_7TW-qDEUSmqfUM9dNdkA CMU This place has decent food It doesn t have much going for it besides the fact that it has a nice bar The service is okay and never exceptional I feel like you can go anywhere and get equal if not better food 
d_w94BM14OFl9cEkJIsU9Q CMU I was staying at the Nassau Inn so I came downstairs for a quick breakfast before leaving As she was seating people the manager kept asking if folks had coupons I showed her their 20 breakfast discount offered on Foursquare and she had no idea what it was The granola with fresh berries that I d ordered was fine as was the coffee but my server was on the inattentive side NOT good since I had less than 10 minutes to eat and pay I finally had to go to the hostess stand to pay and the manager actually photocopied my phone for the Foursquare deal She couldn t figure out how to honor it in their computer system so I wound up paying full price for the meal Way to train your staff folks 
d_Wf6QFbQEdu5g7SKIrcmQ CMU I am not an expert on all things Tiger s Tale but I have stopped in here a couple of times for some beer and food after playing volleyball The beer is cold and they have quite few decent draft selections The food however was not very good I ordered a bar pie and it was pretty much one of the worst bar pies I ve ever had It s really a disgrace for any place in NJ to make a subpar pizza So anyway this place is a cool spot to drink some beers and hang out maybe order a few appetizers but that s about it It s probably not fair to judge their entire menu on one experience with an inedible pizza but I don t know that I d set out for TTT with the intentions of enjoying a good meal 9 07 So I returned to the TT for a Thursday night happy hour dinner The place was packed so I know they re doing something right but I can t figure out why I m the only person not impressed by this place Again no complaints in the beer department however the food was not good Everyone else at the table seemed to be enjoying their burgers so maybe that s what you re supposed to order here but my friend and I hardly made a dent in the appetizers we decided to share 
e-0aVU8NWE5vJRCdqF2dLA CMU In desperate need of a cardiac arrest inducing midnight snack in Princeton Look no further than Hoagie Haven Okay I admit that I actually wanted to grab a breakfast sandwich for tomorrow but that doesn t change the fact that a they are open until LATE b the hoagies are overstuffed and HUGE c um where else can you get a huge sandwich for under 4 on campus My bacon egg and cheese was only 3 50 and I was kinda hungry and feeling adventurous so I decided to grab a chicken salad platter It wasn t that bad surprisingly Actually it was pretty good and not heavy at all enough mayo to make it creamy without overdoing it and came served on a bed of lettuce with tomato slices I know I know salad isn t their forte but now you all are aware that there are some less health hazardous but still cheap good options here Okay lesson learned It s back to the body bag next visit It came to 10 for the salad my sandwich and a BLT friend s Cash only Staff here are good natured flirts for sure and remember the faces of regulars and even ex regulars guilty as charged 
E-S3NKigCQvR-4dWihuoIQ CMU Always a hit in my book never a fan of mall type restaurant but they do it up right here you name a fish they probably have it and can cook it how you like it The bread is out of this world difficult to stop eating it They have a full bar and great ambiance They also have a generous frequent diners club I have been there close to 20 times and it has always been a positive experience 
e0cZaPDSfgcLyOpYgVItuw CMU Not impressed these guys need to kick it up a notch 
E1HQXKxI0hNN4zSudM8VVA CMU Stopped in here for drinks and a bite after a Princeton vs Cornell basketball game We sat at the bar and ordered wings fries and fried green beans The green beans were the best fried green beans I have ever had and the wings were quite good as well Service wasn t great but it was a busy Saturday night in a Princeton bar I would go back just for the green beans 
E1RFV6yZ431hgm_pc2DTAQ CMU This is the place I go to for good happy hour The wine list is good and the ambiance is amazing The food I do not like I ve never had anything here that has blown me away or that I thought was worth the prices they charge Drinks yes Food no 
e8Kx_SEKmvX3XYlayk40Yg CMU Went with my family a couple weeks ago and we all enjoyed ourselves The service was friendly the wine selection decent and the food while it didn t blow us away was solid American fare with a few twists I particularly liked the Moroccan lamb sliders from the mix and match appetizer menu It is a bit on the overpriced side for what it is but actually a pretty good deal for Princeton It s also nice if you want to get away from the Nassau Street dinner hour crowds and not have to contend with street or garage parking Overall if you re looking for a good meal in a relaxed atmosphere give Main Street a chance 
E8S3XIpavkCzLcFaFw0zrg CMU I don t get it People swear by this place but i think it s because any food tastes good when you are drunk and hungry It is open late and is right beside the Ivy Inn I think the sandwiches from the Wawa are better 
EAP0rqvWicO5dTIQP9MfPA CMU Overall the food is good not great I had the chipotle black bean burger on flatbread The patty was mushy but had a decent flavor They forgot the avocado so I had to ask for it To its credit the overall ambiance is pleasant In fact diners have three to choose from the patio the pub or the dining room It s a great place to meet friends for an evening late night drink There s usually an open table and occasionally a live band 
eCENJIZlDrb1AwAI7PI1sQ CMU I have dined at the outdoor Clocktower Cabana area of Main Street several times and had great experiences there The food and drinks are fresh and high quality Perhaps a bit pricey but that s pretty standard for the Princeton area I m prompted to write this review after attempting to go for drinks on the night Friday July 1st after Princeton s fireworks display A group of three of us decided to head to the Cabana to get drinks after the fireworks arriving at the shopping center as soon as traffic allowed before 10pm There were a bunch of people sitting around the bar area but we were told that they were not taking any new customers because they were getting ready to close We went back into town and found several bars to be packed to capacity and were able to have a nice time I am just completely baffled as to why Main Street would close so early on a summer Friday night now that they have the prime outdoor seating area especially after the fireworks on 4th of July weekend 
eCsV5etZlfxhrwTxO7WyfQ CMU Ideally I would give this place 2 5 stars because it has potential BUT there are things that need work Firstly mad props on the decor The interior design of Metro North is outstanding I didn t get a chance to see the rooms beyond the bar and first room but what I saw was extremely impressive They have done a spectacular job of making the restaurant suitable as a lounge an upscale restaurant for a date and a great place to chill with a group of friends The host and bartender couldn t have been nicer which certainly started the night off right Downsides to the bar were the lack of options for beer only 4 on tap and nothing out of the ordinary and the price of each beer 6 for a Brooklyn Ouch House wine was also pricey and the pour was anything but generous With regards to the food alternative side dishes weren t readily accommodated which is always a disappointment I had a chicken sandwich with broccoli rabe and provolone cheese and fries Granted broccoli rabe is naturally bitter but when done right it can be quite tasty Unfortunately this rabe was on the bitter side The sandwich bread was WAY overwhelming and I really don t appreciate when additional condiments appear on sandwiches that weren t listed on a menu don t lather on the mayo or weird brown condiment without telling me ok The chicken was cooked well not overdone nor dry which impressed me I ve had better fries but these weren t bad Dinner friends ordered two pasta dishes and a chicken dish The overall sentiment of the table was that the meal was fine but nothing to ride home about The major downfall for Metro North at this point is the service While the individuals we first encountered were great our waitress wasn t the best She was very nice but when we asked for a few more minutes to peruse the menu she ended up leaving us there for 15 minutes before returning to take our order Also when we ordered more drinks we had to wait a long time to actually get them to the table we were within eyesight of the bar and we could see our drink sitting there waiting to make it to the table 
eEGCtHfAdkC1EpXV9O1sWg CMU Food tastes alright but portions are small and uber expensive Would not recommend no soup for you 
eHwb6jAdh0hsgxvW5-Xhtw CMU PJ s has been a staple of Princeton dinning for longer than I have been alive I used to come here as a kid all the time but a few years ago there was a management change and it hasn t been the same to me since Now I can easily say that PJ s is one of the most overrated restaurants in the area The service has not been great the last few times I have been there but that s the least of my concerns The menu consists of typical diner fare The food is average Some of the sandwiches burgers and paninis are pretty decent Pancakes are in the name so you would expect them to be exceptional The pancakes are not even close to being the best in the area If you want the best pancakes I would travel to East Windsor and try Americana Diner But if you are going to PJ s the two fer is a great deal for breakfast lovers like me Just don t go in there expecting amazing food You might want to expect to see flies all around too Also don t go on weekends during brunch time The line is usually wrapping around the corner and it really isn t worth the wait at all 
ekIGaL5j1lmuRDYBPzcTbQ CMU I have no idea why people like Hoagie Haven Maybe it has something to do with school spirit or hometown nostalgia Maybe they re too wasted to taste the food Anyway Hoagie Haven is just a grungy dive with sandwiches that never fail to make my stomach hurt But I guess you don t have many options in Princeton 
ekYkYtlQqty0EklcOuyutg CMU I ordered one each of the blueberry banana and raisin pancakes and they were amazing But for 9 85 they should offer a side of something Service was good once inside but when we arrived there were no tables and they told us to wait outside where it was freezing 
eLb0FWUrpWPOzZsLDhwZrg CMU There s nothing I can say that can express my feelings towards this place other than to look at the large number of positive reviews that follow below mine I would gladly trade the Rutgers Grease Trucks for Hoagie Heaven I would even go as far as to say the cheesesteaks at Hoagie Heaven are some of the best I ve ever had even better than famous cheesesteak places like Pat and Gino s in Philly Nothing beats the quality of food you get at such a low price 
EneRidw9-Ir7Z8Zr7pzGxA CMU I took some family to see Princeton and was looking for a place to have lunch but everything on Nassau seemed so small and crowded Decided on Winberie s which also turned out not to be all that spacious but otherwise had a nice pub atmosphere The burgers were really good Paid with a large bill and told our server we didn t need change On our way out the door she made sure to catch up with us to thank us for coming in Nice to know the big tip was appreciated 
eOJxQfRletRqeflCFNzGcg CMU Quite a few options for the vegetarian The eggplant Parm is fantastic as well as the cheese omelet And there is your standard tuna and egg They have rice pudding and tiramisu which I cant wait to try 
eooaY5mILW5jpiVjDKXfOg CMU I used to come here ALL the time when it first opened but now I live in NYC The food was consistently really good diner food and the service was always friendly A great diner is rare but Zorba s is one of them 
Ep2Gke5J5WvA8EzdEyGeYQ CMU The rolls weren t even good The entrees were bland and watery We even found packaging paper in one of our dishes The water said Oh Sorry and then gave us the check and we left So overrated 
eRrM-WPsL5IP6RUvJE3Ejg CMU While driving through NJ my dad wanted to stop at one of the many memories he had from college Staying up late studing and dropping by here in the late hours of the night to grab one of the best hoagie s ever These things are what my dad would say exquisite The bread is awesome and the amount of food you get for the low price is fantastic I love how they have pictures hanging on the wall next to the register of people wearing their Hoagie Haven T Shirts from all over the world It made me want to buy one and I did So now I have this awesome orange Hoagie Haven shirt that is the colors of the school it represents Princeton I ordered the Pizza Steak Hoagie because it was my dads favorite and my sister got the meatball one I am not a fan of meatball sandwitches but when I tried hers it was really really really great I absolutely loved mine I ate half of a whole one with my dad and I kept thinking I wanted more but when I got up to go order another the line was out the door and we needed to get back on the road This place has a spot in my dads heart and I have to say this place is so good it is now apart of me too Maybe it runs in the blood but I have to say I can not wait to come back here Maybe I should try and get accepted to Princeton haha in my dreams 
EtcnLEDAGspNvmyTt27JCA CMU A comfortable and affordable spot in Princeton with decent prices and a university pub ambiance I nearly always get the appetizer order of Quesadillas as a meal They re huge affordable and tasty the not so secret special ingredient is bacon My husband loves the Bistro burger which comes with a generous topping of Brie I can also recommend as a healthier option the chili meal which is flavorful filling and comes with salad and garlic bread 
EtitovjDU4grmB9ySUuHcg CMU PJ s Pancake House has a neighborhood like almost quirky feel to it in a good way There are customer writings initials names tags etc all over the walls which gives the place character The particular table that my party of 6 was seated at had a big square shaped wooden pole right smack in the middle of the table so it was a little difficult to communicate with those seated on the other side of that pole I m not sure why whoever designed the place decided to build a table around a pole but rest assured that those type of tables are the minority in the restaurant The dish I ordered consisted of 2 scrambled eggs an English muffin and their mashed brown it was quite good but nothing extraordinarily spectacular I did have a few bites of my cousin s pancakes and I d have to say that they are doing their food namesake justice the pancakes were large thick fluffy and pretty yummy The service was quick attentive we never had to flag someone down for water refills and friendly Overall it is a great place to grab breakfast if you re in the Princeton University area I was there on a weekday in the late morning so I can t really comment on the wait as there wasn t really one at that time 
EV31kxjzFBSNsOR7aCdd7Q CMU Yeeeeeeeah They ditched the styrofoam so we are back as customers and reading group now meets here weekly 
EX-uz8QP21vE5aPPN8Zebw CMU The Salt Creek Grille appears to be a fancy shmancy establishment since it is in Princeton NJ and when you walk in you see a fireplace and beautiful decor Almost like a lodge And the food is outstanding especially their garlic shoe string fries The service is good but not overbearing However you don t end up being gauged when your bill comes 
Ex02y4FsR-5eSjOuROnQoQ CMU The dinner prices are atrocious The food is good but not nearly the best They re a little more creative than Red Lobster but you end up paying for it Our wine glasses were only 1 3 filled The server was good but almost unemotional I recommend going for happy hour They have great drinks and appetizers set at a very affordable price only available at the bar area 
--05HWh3tFtXAjTV4vquHg CMU Harvest is such a hidden gem This restaurant is tucked away behind several storefronts in Harvard Square The neon sign outside does not do it justice it is a very upscale restaurant with a great ambiance and inner courtyard The food was great our waiter was able to recommend a nice wine pairing as well We had an interesting sweet corn chowder very rich The french fries with truffle oil are to die for you can t eat just one The fish was excellent and the dessert menu was very nice Would go back for a special occasion in a heartbeat 
-0PZxOXJcG6brIiRhjkung CMU I have eatten at Harvest over fifty times and it is consistently good The atmosphere is casual comfortable elegance with warm colors and dark woods You can chose to dine at the bar lounge area the dining room or in the outdoor garden area during summer season The bar itself is great when you are alone I eat everything on the menu including varieties of fish steak poultry oysters salads soup hamburger and small bites at the bar They have a full bar and a wine list Sunday brunch is excellent but be sure you very hungry as it is three courses It is great place for a date casual conversation drinks dessert or a special occassion All the waitstaff host and bartenders are very professional and polite This is one my favorites in Boston Cambridge Keep in mind a average dinner is about 75 00 a person Parking in Harvard Square is difficult unless you valet park 
-1xFS36_MkjmjAV8UdsYKQ CMU sure I ll meet you there for a beer location great and people watching cant be beat Do NOT recommend the watery lobster bisque horrible go with what everyone else recommends here I wish I had 
-3tXPyHq00eqKs-vMqZ_Zg CMU Lord Hobo has a solid beer list and delicious food It s worth the hassle to park and the journey all the way to Cambridge Hobo has a pretty big bar but there are also quite a few tables It s a great place to get dinner or just a few beers Everything on their food menu looks awesome so it was really hard to decide on one thing for dinner I settled on the Mac and cheese which was served in a flaming hot skillet and was tasty I m glad that s the entree that I selected I shared the polenta fries as an appetizers and I actually wish that I had gotten one for myself For dinner They were UNREAL and I will proceed to order me every time I go back The lights are usually fairly dimmed so it has a great ambiance However it can be a little hard to read the menus especially when there are so many beers to choose from at least 2 pages The bartenders know all abut the beers on tap which is refreshing 
-5o_ffhxQnH2SZOIlcHTqQ CMU So in this update I m giving Lord Hobo five stars for being awesome minus one star for being so expensive Why you ask A review of our finances from this winter should answer both questions The truth is that in February we spent more money at Lord Hobo than we did on groceries Yowch I think perhaps we like too much 
-6atIPyHlAFtUOI4C1ZWcA CMU The menu is interesting I had a salad with dried cherries and grilled chicken They only have beer to drink but its a refreshing choice for their outdoor patio in the summer 
-bluwNZ3BwPjthfrP_00HQ CMU I love Miracle of Science on nights when the music is really great like tonight and Annie is working The food is very yummy the Coke was ice cold and the margarita did the trick I ve only been here twice and see it only as 5 star worthy The cherry on top the menu Periodic table Very select But well worth it 
-cDK3b2VQN_w5u4zILr5Nw CMU This is kind of a standard cocktail lounge in Harvard Square But it s a place you end up going multiple times because there aren t many options like it in the Square but also because they do everything decently well I came here for a party We were all seated in the back in a semi private room which was great There were long tables and chairs against the walls and plenty of seating room To be honest it was a great set up for this party I can t speak to the price since I didn t pay but the drinks were pretty decent and standard and the food fare was about the same As one of the few options it does the trick 
-CQDwZ2Bu3l78VCvaFzpaQ CMU Every time I head in to CBC I like it better and better Fine It s growing on me Great for happy hour Great for weekend lunch on the patio Not so great for tasty food across the board Go for the daily specials to try something unique Popular for beer towers And they have those big growler jugs for 10 a two buck deposit Not bad Typically known as CBC Overall go for the beer tower in the strongest ale they offer In the spring I like their Belgian beer Damn what s it called However taste it before ordering Some Belgians of theirs aren t so great ATMOSPHERE Down home lodge like or something You sort of feel like you re at a brewery Interesting right Well it s got a wooden bar and stools and tables and things Nothing fancy Good for big groups Smells of toasted barley and fermenting yeast BEER Inconsistent I love beer and microbrews especially There are a few beers that I think are great Their standard brews are great but their special brews have their ups and downs i e Belgian style beers don t taste anything like some of the Belgian beers you might get at say Bukoswki s in Inman I can t even give CBC credit for trying Their ambers and lagers and those dark ones are tasty Also I have been a big fan of the Barley wine Why can t you get THAT in a tall beer tower Good choices 1 Red God spring summer super strong hop flavor but it s surprisingly smooth and 8 5 abv 2 Amber Ale all the time is dark but smooth light on the hops enjoyed by many 3 Tall Tale Pale Ale all the time is pale but flavorful FOOD I like the pork chop That s about it I ve tried other dishes the fish and chips is dry the asian spring rolls are sort of tasteless and totally pre made They seem to have a lot of specials so I recommend giving those a shot In a nutshell their menu is constantly changing as of late and I love that 
-DBuKOCMzKVGsje7DgOf-g CMU A lot of potential but it doesn t hit the mark Much better places to grab a beer in the area CBC Lord Hobo The beer list is impressive but like everyone else I swung and missed several times at some great sounding but currently out of stock selections The different measurements for the pour volume is also ridiculous Centiliters Also whoever told my friend to order the pork rinds has a dark sense of humor 
-dVnRsuu9MfoLgeVk-5O0A CMU This is the closest pub to my place I m a big fan of their Big Man Ale as well as the pale ale I m not really feelin the Amber They have a decent pub grub menu and respectable bar The growlers are a bit pricey but worth it if you want microbrew freshness 
-DXtJCCHponJAUUwcpVVUg CMU I came here for a brunch on a cold Sunday morning so can t speak much to the nightlife nor dinner menu However the atmosphere was nice and the food was for the most part good Nothing really blew me away As far as sticking to the them I did notice the regular menu written in period table format on the wall which seems to be the key feature of the restaurant I ll give it to them that was very cool Food was even grouped by themed into the columns and for the most part increased in price as you traveled from the top of the column to the bottom With the exception of the skewers whats up with that guys I ordered the sourdough french toast with grilled banana I was a bit disappointed that those two items were completely separate from one another on my plate and it was only half of a grilled banana which could be rationed over only about 3 4 bites of my french toast So I basically had an order of sourdough french toast It was good but nothing special My boyfriend had the breakfast wrap Again good but nothing amazing The side of potatoes was phenomenal though We were both a bit hungry and the guys at the next table had the egg sandwich which was packed with toppings and looked amazing We ordered a 3rd meal one of those to split and it was quite fantastic I d skip the french toast and order that first if I went back Other items to note the waitress had originally charged me extra for the grilled banana on the bill extra 2 50 before I pointed out it was listed as coming with the dish on the menu She explained it was her first brunch and apologized and corrected it quickly Also the coffee maker was broken and no coffee was available when we arrived at about 10 am on a Sunday I find that unacceptable Go buy a cheap 12 cup maker down the street or buy resell a to go crate of it from dunkin donuts Don t deny your morning customers coffee Oh and the table in the middle of the room seems customized designed and is absolutely awesome Where can I get one 
-FWPnaJOytxCTOor7Ym5WQ CMU Location is fantasic for people watching The inside is sleek and nice with a decent beer selection The menu is a bit different and the service was quite slow considering we were there on a Saturday afternoon and there were only 3 other tables with people at them The food was alright but I really don t think I would go back The idea is there but something is missing 
-G74BD64Cug7Igh7qx_Jdg CMU Cheapest double burger and brew in the City 10 done and done Good fries too Only bad thing limited seating gets pretty packed The server also tried to short change us once which was pretty annoying But overall I really love this place Parking is TOUGH though and the lot next door even w validation is 12 00 even if you re only there an hour The staff is also awesome b c I left my wallet there didn t realize till the next morning frantically raced over to get it and they had it all contents present and accounted for ps there s seating upstairs too if downstairs is crowded 
-GQrUE7abCeYII3yhQ55iw CMU Okay so this is my spot for lunch when I take my staff out for reviews My fav plate is the dbbl cheeseburger plate jalapeno poppers and ddbl Lobster roll 11 00 Holy Crustaceans Batman The staff is great Bartenders are friendly and townie beers aahhhh what a selection If you are ever in Harvard Square it is a must that you sop in and get eatin 
-gXpiLNaaeNh-X6uN9jxlQ CMU We stumbled upon this place for lunch since we had an hour or so before our tour of Harvard started and I m glad we did My husband loved the beer and had a huge burger free range organic yummy beef cooked to order I had the steak sliders with roasted peppers and blue cheese which was great We had Boston Creme Pie for dessert because we were in Boston The service was fast and friendly 
-g_fyOnklCXYrQBFk-Fncw CMU Our going away celebration for labmates VS My dinner of an apple crisp AND a Brownie Sunday My dessert of grilled meatloaf My postdessert dessert of bread pudding Several pitchers of stouts ales and porters Who wins The bread pudding by a sweet caramelly landslide My dinner of dessert items apple crisp wasn t very spicy or apply brownies were rock hard and dense made eating a chore Meatloaf grilled Isn t that just a flat square hamburger I don t want grill marks on my meatloaf Unfortunately I also expect soft crumbly texture for meatloaf not the chewy consistency here Bread pudding only outstanding thing pillowy soft topped with a wonderful caramel sauce nice to have on a chilly night get this instead of any other dessert on their menu Appetizers pretty typical fare nothing outstanding buffalo wings needed to be kicked up a notch in spiciness Overall if you need to entertain a large group of friends or coworkers in Harvard Square here s a decent place to go for some pitchers of beer 
-HHKXGcbC3OQ0oXfFDkdHA CMU I remember my grandmother walking us down here for lunch on many occasions The Rice and Beans are so good Being Italian I really have no idea what I m ordering or what it s called but the fried pork thingies and the potatoes with the meet inside were awesome The portions are large and everyone is very nice They seem to go on vacation for weeks at a time but when they are there its awesome 
-HOs9IfbrTzYenTDTMXbkg CMU Let me start by saying I love the Miracle of Science Tory Row is in a good spot convenient for my waiting for the Lady to finish her yoga class times and the occasional Harvard Square afternoon beer Honestly the food is only OK but this is just a decent spot to get a drink 
-HrWZxlHMtu03gd0CjpkpQ CMU Went for drinks on a late Monday afternoon sat at the bar About 100 beers on tap all served in the perfect glass Server was helpful and cheerful knew her beers and steered me toward a fantastic IPA after letting me try a couple samples My friend loved the gazpacho which was pureed and topped with a drizzle of olive oil and some decorative purple flowers Also ordered the charcuterie plate which had among other things a house made pate that must be the love child of bacon and fois gras Served with crispy buttery toast points Yum Went back another night for an excellent burger and fries at the bar Different waiter equally excellent service Thumbs up 
-IooZ_UmGQ8Sqdt0HS0WwQ CMU I never really feel like I m going into battle when I come here with a lot of people I ve had spontaneous cast parties here and last time I was here with 6 people from work Even though we got a smaller table than desired we were never really considered a burden which sometimes happen when you roll up to a place with more than 4 people I think John Harvard s is always good for groups minus Monday night trivia heh The food is definitely hit or miss Sometimes they try and go over the top with sandwiches by making them HUGE Salads are great but get the dressing on the side to avoid soggy leaves and an overdose of creaminess I m not crazy about the regular beers but sometimes I ll get one of their features And they have growlers for those interested in taking home their favorite beer from this brew house Like I kind of mentioned up top the service is really great Most if not all the waiters I ve had have been pretty entertaining and definitely chill I just wish the food was just as consistent 
-IzEXa0lK-OkVLDqROiA7Q CMU I really think that if you live in or around Boston you have to hit up Miracle of Science at least once I freaking adore the enormous Periodic Table menu they have conveniently located on a chalkboard wall The atmosphere is really casual the service is good the crowd is laid back the drink selection and price is reasonable and the food is solid There s no reason to NOT eat here at least once 
-L2NF7I2kd3oBLi3DhJIDA CMU Lord or Hobo Last night I went with friends to Lord Hobo aka the resting place of B Side Lounge and we were all very confused for what they are trying to go for On the one hand the lights are bright gone are the cozy booths of B side to be replaced with uncomfortable high top tables and backless stools and a bunch of flat screen tv s playing sports Ok so looking around you think this is a dive sports bar Then the menu comes with admittedly creative but expensive entr es starting at 20 What the what If I want to spend 20 an entr e I want an atmosphere to match like Oleana or Dante but with dive sports bar atmosphere I need a huge plate of nachos for 6 and 3 drafts What Lord Hobo has is a major identity crisis Maybe that s what the weird name is all about Lord prices with a hobo atmosphere Not sure who they are trying to appeal to The crowd seemed to be inherited b side hipsters not the frat boys who might be into watching sports on the flat screen tv s Well good luck lord hobo and working out your identity issues I won t be back The whole experience just made miss B side more tear Peace out girl scouts 
-MlkSMtKgl5F_BnsKpo1lg CMU Chill laid back atmosphere perfect for a lazy afternoon lunch or dinner I came with 5 others just after the Sunday lunch rush A waiter came up to us and said the big table was about to free up but we could grab drinks at the bar while waiting We sat at the right angle high table and ordered off the periodic table menu of burgers and satays The waiters even have nerdy shorthand to take orders The mimosas are served in regular pint glasses and decently priced considering how much you re getting to get pleasantly buzzed during the day My Ronie burger was stuffed with jalapenos and spicy The fries are really pan fried potato wedges so they might be healthier for you than regular french fries Service was ok Our server was nice and helpful I definitely could ve used a water refill early into my jalapeno burger Nice views of Mass Ave where you can people watch and observe men unicycling down the street 
-n70KjLgEwovqh3yr0nzGQ CMU I tried this place on a Friday night It was suggested by a friend for drinks I d never been and some of the reviews here were good so we tried it out The location was really convenient I happened to drive in but lucked out with a free spot on a side street It s at basement level so its low key and private from the street above We sat outside on the patio area The service was quick and very friendly Good wine and drink selection The server suggested some new summer beers which we tried For appetizers the chicken quesadillas were really packed full of meat and vegetables and were great Around 10 they started moving the tables and to make the dance floor and the music started going and they were charging a cover The crowd was a diverse mix of people mostly in their 20 s I will check this place out again I hear Thursday s are really hopping 
-NrMvA2Cv9JWjp9p2R_UwQ CMU Izzy s is one of those neighborhood institutions I wish we have at home in the DC suburbs We were treated like a neighbor the service was very friendly Food was very good of the home cooked variety I had the ox tail stew with a cup of the beef tripe soup Everything was great Lots of the neighborhood residents stopped by while we were eating to get carryout and chatted with the boss and his wife and son Would love to return again next time I m back in Boston 
-oRPxciUwq8YeS-IcxDERA CMU Went here last night for some post work drinks after trying to go to Grendel s too crowded and before we headed over to The Burren Cozy bar decent beer selection no hard liquor drinks though be warned nice music casual divey atmosphere I liked that they listed Black Tan Snakebite and Black Velvet on the actual menu I tend to forget these exist unless reminded and their hand cut fries were fresh thick and chunky with the skins still on just how I like em Service was decent prices are decent all in all not a bad place to grab some drinks Not a total destination but not a total last resort either IMO 
-OzYi3VsnEz9xisag5qbUA CMU I went for a celebration dinner One of Amy s friends was just asked to join the faculty of a major college They figured that John Harvard s would be a good choice The insides feature dark wood and sturdy chairs I loved that The menu features mostly burgers sandwiches some main dishes American food a few pizzas a few salads and bar food type appetizers Both of the ladies got salads with teriyaki chicken One made a serious dent into hers and the other finished hers off completely I love a woman who tucks into her food I asked for an Angus beef roquefort sp burger It comes with a pickle spear and steak fries I m not much of a fries kind of guy anymore but I do love steak fries especially when they are crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside These were not those fries Some were perfectly cooked others were limp and had probably been sitting around for a while I wasn t going to eat them all anyway so me picking out the ones I like worked out ok However if I were truly hungry and wanted to eat more fries I would have been super disappointed The fries were dusted with some sort of seasoning salt Probably Lawry s Chop up some garlic parsley and some parmesan and dust them in that and you would have some awesome steak fries I didn t eat the bun on my burger It was a soft bread The menu said kaiser roll but it reminded me more of potato bread The burger patty wasn t too well seasoned I asked for well done It was well done I couldn t taste the cheese at all The carmelized onions didn t do much to add to the flavor The bacon on my burger however was delicious I wish I had asked for a BLT with that bacon It would have been delicious Our waitress was pretty good about keeping glasses refilled This would be a good place for a birthday dinner I noticed a smaller dining room to the side I wanted to sit in there ha ha The pizzas and wings I saw on other tables looked delicious I think I just ordered the wrong things Prices weren t unreasonable either 
-PC82Jh-d5YW9ERiDJNMKw CMU Good food Had the salmon and calamari Took my wife there for Valentine s day had a three course meal with a glass of wine was awsome 
-qhMFbo7I2qrJKZRiZ2YDg CMU Went back with a gift card Service was substantially better We shared the asparagus small plate delicious perfectly cooked with crispy cippolini onions and parmesaen cheese calamari and the special sweet potato hash with a fried egg and spinach salad with pickled onions Yum Still pretty chilly in there and so loud but I think it s the acoustics of the place high ceilings with copper tiles And also the lack of raw oysters I was craving them and we figured we d use our GC and get oysters in 1 fell swoop 
-qkynTd5cLtJnGzCG7TBMA CMU This place sucks Miracle of Science refers to the process by which most of the patrons were created because there s no way on earth that such nerds could have been formed by sexual procreation But I digress The staff is rude and ignorant of both science and hospitality so I have no reservations about trashing this place on Yelp Why it is still in business is a miracle of its own This place caters to the high tech biotech crowd that loves their beer I know because I was one of them once upon a time and to my former lab nerds who are no doubt either a wasting time at work or b laid off for the nth time because biotech companies are run by incompetent and or greedy bastards who prey on the nerdy let me extend a big hello and say to you yes I do feel your pain You are not alone 3 2 1 Contact fooled a lot of us into believing that we should devote our lives to finding cures for diseases that only the people in finance will be able to afford But someday one of us will invent a time machine that will take us back to our misspent youth i e college and we ll set ourselves straight and not let our younger selves waste time studying organic chemistry But I digress Although by the time one is promoted from RA I to RA II in this town our well respected almost 30 something scientists know enough to hit up the bars where they can meet people who ve never ordered anything out of the VWR catalogue Maybe someone in an evening MBA program at Brandies And that s probably a good thing for the gene pool Did I mention the Miracle of Science sucks It s wicked hot in there in the summertime because the architects botanists science enthusiasts who designed the place modeled it after a god damn greenhouse Genius And I agree with whats his face who says that you pay an atmosphere tax to hang here Yeah atmosphere measured to be approximately 0 ATM Giggle at that ya nerds And no there s nothing scientific about the place The name is a gimmick I know like the 21st Amendment over in Beacon Hill but minus the wit What I would like to know is why aren t there bars in the financial district such as Soulless Moneygrubbers etc But I digress Um this place sucks Peace 
-RSRJpG_GxG1UezyvuvrbA CMU As Hobo has shaken off it s opening blues its food has gotten better and more consistant A fun place to go not as awesome as Deep Ellum but for being in my backyard a great place 
-SbEL0XUYa_xy1iXJmEjdg CMU Best value of a lobster roll anywhere near the city A little mayo y but you get 2 for like 11 Wash it down with a nice cold Guiness and you re good to go Not the cleanest pub around but a favorite in Harvard Square 
-SGKEyOcIg1Oz7dSlVuLjw CMU I love CBC s Great Pumpkin Ale I have for years It s the reason I was so excited to try their Wilson spiced pumpkin porter and their Belgian style pumpkin beer It s the reason my buddy and I decided to brave a torrential downpour and haul ourselves over here through the muck But as has happened before we got there and they were out of their own beer Out of the porter Out of the Belgian one I mean c mon did you honestly think people wouldn t like them That we re all here for the food or something We were not It s average If you had asked me that night I d have given them one star but I ve cooled down a bit And their beer WHEN IT S AVAILABLE is fantastic But if you re looking forward to trying a particular brew call ahead Their website is no help it said available today on draft which was clearly not the case 
-sJyd_8de7ZX0RH8mdu8Sw CMU This place is exclusively patronized by non Cambridge folk or some of the rubes at the College The food is terrible and the drinks underwhelming The sole strong point is that if you have a huge and unwieldy group of people you can come here and get seated 
-TagNMcAfgQrnT741OAkIw CMU Came here for a little college friend reunion which was a party of about 20 people Seeing friends was nice and all but the best part about having that many people was the fact that we ordered 3 towers of beer The ones that stood out was the Great Pumpkin ale and the Punjabi Pumpkin The first was well rounded and the second was uniquely spiced Food was okay but I think people come here for their brews All I can remember was that they had good nachos Hope that helps 
-VqHsNVx0oAe27Dm2uIMGw CMU Fine by me I can think of bars that are better at all of Charlie s specialties than Charlie s Better burgers at the Burren better beer selection at Bukowski or Cambridge Brewing Company better karaoke at the Asgard etc But Charlie s does well enough at all of those that it s still a good place to go And once you ve made it to Harvard you don t need to be The Best Just good enough at everything you do 
-W72mjOkFTXsMizjWeemfw CMU I never see soap in their bathrooms so I m not sure how the staff are washing their hands Enough said Oh yea that staff is nice and the service is good It s always crowded seat wise But yea Methinks not 
-wuFPQCeAqsQKHtZEA2OFA CMU I ve never ever had good service here but with that said the food isn t bad I don t mind going here when I have time to burn with friends Not the best not the worst The chicken salad is really good if i remember correctly 
-WVwhT8D1I0J2WN_nQ7h3A CMU I m fairly neutral on the topic Working in Kendall leaves us limited places to drink after work So often we head here When it s warm out the outdoor tables are the best thing about this place The food is ok the beer is decent the service is a little sad Nothing decidedly awesome or horrid has ever taken place here when I ve been here I ve never had a burning desire to go but I ve never not gone out because we were heading to CBC 
-XeDThHKSwi04_W12ZiGTQ CMU I am truly upset to have to give this great place only three stars but before I divuldge the spoiler of my night I ll tell you all the great things about this restaurant My mother and I plus some family friends went to Harvest by default after realizing the wait at Dali was far too long My mother spent her post college years in Boston and loved Harvest even then They do a wonderful job with fresh simple and delicious flavors One of our dining companions had asparagus soup that was incredible One of my favorite dishes seared scallops were listed and I naturally chose them for my entree Four scallops arrived over a bed of cooked red cabbage and other greens and they were DELICIOUS Others at the table who are hardcore pescatarians agreed my scallops were wonderful and so were their various fish dishes Dessert was wonderful We had a strawberry based shortcake ish thing and a chocolate souffle that really satisfied my constant nagging chocolate craving Now here comes the bad part NEVER ORDER A FANCY COCKTAIL AT HARVEST Or at least not one with bitters compari and kumquat all in one drink What sounded like a delightfully sweet sour citrus y elixir turned out to be none other than cough syrup My mom was joking that they should call it triamenic or dimeatap because at least then they d be truthful and a little more clever about the awful taste Ooof I rarely abandon a cocktail but this one was potentially lethal The food however was so wonderful Order anything on the menu just be careful about being too adventurouson their cocktail menu 
-yhH61l0S5L3yQe6Xptu0A CMU If you are going to go high end dining and want presentation more than being completely stuffed with food this fits the bill We had a large group for a birthday party so we worked with the planners in advance It narrows your choices down but honestly that isn t a bad thing They were very accommodating we had a screened off place to the side of the entrance and our own staff so service was pretty good Let s just say no one s wine glass stayed empty for long There is no wifi through the restaurant but you can use the Harvard University guest access if you truly need to check Facebook during the evening The appetizer portions seemed a little on the small side but that s because the Jonah Crab salad was magnificent and I wanted more A lot of flavor in that little salad I had the top sirloin and it was cooked perfectly again tons of flavor The potato puree was a bit on the salty side but mixing it in with my bites of sirloin helped The sirloin portion was a decent size but the potatoes and vegetables were lacking a bit Dessert was a tort which I had to give the rest to my husband because it was just a little too rich for me He was also still hungry his cheesecake was much smaller sized than my tort All in all it was a wonderful dining experience and more importantly the birthday girl was happy 
00j423kbBGK_EPuyba29gQ CMU Walking around Harvard Square and I was craving some good pub food Walking into the restaurant down into a darkened bar reminded me of what it felt like to go to Cheer s super cool We sat at the bar service was a little slow at first I went with a burger can t remember the name but it had bacon and cheese I remembered this time to ask for medium rare I always forget and end up getting well The food came before our water and place settings but the food was good The burger was perfect The accompanying steak fries were divine and the portion was more than enough I tried the spiced apple mojito interesting and tasty 
01bukm1U6bWyH0DdDhNJtw CMU I had been to the previous bar restaurant in this spot The B Side Lounge many times over the past eight years and it was always a great meal with great drinks When it closed and Lord Hobo opened my husband and I were excited to check it out The decor is definitely more modern We went for lunch on a Saturday and the place was empty so I cannot comment on noise levels as others have I had a Cuban sandwich with a half and half lemonade iced tea Sandwich was OK drink a bit too sour Husband had a burger w an egg on it and a bloody Mary Overall food was all right prices were all right I would not go back though There was nothing particularly impressive about the menu or our meal 
03rHyJqyVY5qv-HQ1bbIkA CMU Did not order the food this is just a beer review It was a Saturday night so understandably crowded Wish the bar had more seating though they try their best The beer in one word is hoppy If you like that sort of thing fine but the amber was hoppy and the porter was hoppier really I dared not try the IPA The specialty beers were better I tried Sgt Pepper brewed with peppercorns and a Scottish double malt that despite its 9 alcohol content was by far the smoothest brew of the night Still hoppy They also had a mix of beer sake but for a brewery they managed to do the sake right and the beer wrong I hate to say it but you could get a Sam Adams seasonal on tap elsewhere that beats any of the regular beers here 
03viKo6zJSZDw2Onqbkyog CMU Unlike the dusty thatched roof mead halls of yore Meadhall is crisp and clean and doesn t serve mead I personally prefer a lived in feel for my bars but i m sure that will come in time The place is spacious with a high ceiling and windows that open onto Broadway and Ames The centerpiece of the room is its magnificent bar large and oval shaped a wall protecting the copper altar of 110 beer taps in the center of the hall A garland of library reading lamps adorn the bar adding a touch of class even if they look a bit out of place The staff seem stressed and somewhat confused which can be forgiven considering this is their first 24 hours of business also i think their computer system is down the menu is somewhat incomplete and has actually been updated and replaced since i began writing this review Expect similar prices to their formidable competitor Lord Hobo However unlike many of the bars in this area Meadhall has SPACE I would not hesitate in bringing a party of 20 here Regarding their beer menu the trend seems to be local and or good beers only relative to the other super beer bar in boston Sunset Grill you will find fewer obscure european beers here in lieu of a wide selection of american craft beers It will take a while to work through them all but i can say it s a good sign that every beer is served in its appropriate glass some people care about this All in all a great addition to the beertastic Kendall area why isn t Harvard this hip Will check back soon after they have debugged 
04paQdXP6OkRhnlbv9-A9w CMU Have eaten here twice initially I had been skeptical because it seemed like a staid hotel restaurant type of place but I m glad I tried it because it is actually quite fresh The cuisine seems to be American with an emphasis on in season ingredients and the wine list is excellent fyi they also re cork The portions are pretty sizeable I recently had the duck and could not finish The bread before the meal is awesome it included flatbreads cornbread and a soda bread It is on the expensive side 2 entrees 1 app 1 bottle of wine runs well over 150 most appetizers are well priced and the burger is reasonable fries come in a mini All Clad pot The ambience is nice dark woods inside and a sizeable patio with a fireplace and heat lamps Definitely recommend 
076lvlxiYSBpH96is1A8wA CMU I come here often for the Tuesday night karaoke kind of a hipster scene but a good mix of other people with a bunch of friends Excellent time prompt drinks at a decent price and usually friendly service Had the chicken fingers several times good food The only downsides are they don t allow dancing wtf We do it anyways but have been told to stop by a kind of dickish short guy a couple of times And some nights it can get really crowded and impossible to find a table upstairs if you arrive past 10 30 I ve been to the beer garden before too and while it s equally crowded almost all the time it s worth waiting for a table to open up Great place to bring a group of friends and chat over drinks during the spring or summer 
07bROAjQNMLqgEu9Ao7_jA CMU The beer selection is much more impressive than Charlie s rough and rusty facade would suggest so go for the beer and fries Try to find a seat in the beer garden if you can its atmosphere is much more fun and relaxed than inside seating The burgers are not all they re cracked up to be Well let me rephrase that to be more generous and specific When sober the burgers do not meet one s typical standards for such food drunk however these burgers do juuuust fine The place is famous for double burgers two thin patties on an open faced bun Thin patties are hard to time well so 9 times out of 10 you ll be getting a dry burger here The fancy burgers have enough sauce and cheese to mask this try the Guinness burger for full effect Waitstaff was pleasant enough but not too rushed or fussed After months of smelling Charlie s deliciousness from the bus stop across the street I m glad I ve tried But if I m being completely honest the smell alone will not be enough to tempt me into a second visit You re better off spending your hard earned cash at one of the myriad other burger joints around town 
0AnzhMsCKQ5q66lkaJdwVg CMU Charlie s is reasonably priced and has great portions Their Beer Garden outside can get packed very quickly on nice summer nights but I m usually able to find a seat inside Last night I had a delicious lobster meat fresh green salad and my finace had the double cheese burger We both enjoyed the meals 
0aUkhS1KIqBDt1oH4WA1aA CMU After hearing great things about this place from friends my friends and I decided to have a Man Outing to Harvest for dinner I m sorry to say but we found it pretty disappointing Though the wait staff was perfectly fine the food was not at the quality and taste that one would expect at such a high end establishment This was subsequently confirmed when I went to Harvest with my family for my mother s birthday meal once and it was pretty much what I had experienced before Several of my other friends have raved about this place but I just don t see why To me Harvest is just a ridiculously overpriced restaurant 
0B1HmzhLZZo42KjH8tNt4w CMU Downstairs Charlies is my favorite but either floor when not too busy is nice I love their selection of drinks because they includ ONE of my favorite beers not the other but Framboise is really good and i can live with it Charlies kitchen has an outside section that i have yet to try but i am looking forward to the summer when its open 
0Bc0bc5gNQuBIVXTjUMjFg CMU This place is great especially during the summer It is small and intimate It has a large selection of beers and lovely outdoor seating where you can watch people walking up and down JFK street The prices are good and the staff is friendly Shays is a great place to meet for an afternoon beer and catch up with friends 
0bL1njwId555TzT3QFNWaA CMU Tory Row could be a great addition to the Harvard Square food scene but it s not great It s OK 3 5 stars really but I ll round it up to four We started with the wasik curry apricot spread which was so good I enjoyed the combination of sweet with the flavor The spread was quite rich as wasik I didn t know is a type of cheese We were served a generous portion of sliced baguette which we pretty much devoured in 2 seconds I m always enthused when I come across a place that has homemade veggie burgers so I was quick to order that comes with two thin patties with beans corn carrots oats and other sorts of veggie goodness with your cheese of choice veggies and a side of potatoes The potatoes were like homefries quite good The veggie burgers were delicious as well The service was meh and Leighann s fork was dirty Like really dirty as in it looked like it was covered in caramel sauce Dis GUISTING I wouldn t protest a return to Tory Row but there are other places I d prefer to go I d potentially get their veggie burger to go as it was delicious 
0BnYPRYJMB7CzRQ_NbjLlA CMU Friendly service old crew from the Avenue who are awesome good food great selection of beer little pricey but definitely worth it 
0BTyPL-lJGqfcyXIdKQ1NA CMU There s really no reason to ever go to Redline though I don t hate it with a passion would probably give 2 1 2 stars It s kind of in a dingy sort of basement but pretends it s sort of a pseudo classy club However after having been there probably almost 10 times I have finally learned the secret to a fun or at least tolerable time at Redline many many drinks before entering the premises Then at least the dancing will be sort of fun no matter what crap music DJ is playing They lychee martinis are pretty good too run about 10 The oddest experience I ve had at Redline is the bouncers giving everyone 1 one night as we were walking in A reverse cover Don t mind if I do 
0cpD3T1EwHyAZU5vih6knA CMU Blegh This was surprisingly underwhelming Besides the prime Harvard location and a bit of a trendy cool vibe I don t think this place has much going for it The waitstaff is good very attentive The food is just not very good It was just mediocre at best I got the flatbread with the egg cheese and bacon Tasteless almost like they forgot the salt My friend got the scrambled eggs and French toast both were mediocre at best Since I primarily rate on food yeah it sucks in my book The prices are okay at 9 11 for brunch the place is tiny they left the front door open for some time and that made me cold Nah won t go again Unfortunately there aren t too many good places in Harvard Square to really eat at period 
0czshUG7SjUySEqRAfHVzw CMU Brunch here was fabulous I mean it helped that we had a gift certificate otherwise I would probably be complaining about high prices Although it s not bad if you go there for a treat every once and awhile Food was fantastic and I love that they give fresh fruit on the side of larger breakfast entrees Beer selection is great and their brunch cocktail list was fantastic However I wasn t a fan of the ridiculously loud music and I think that s my only real complaint I mean I really had to yell across the table to be heard As a quiet person by nature that was really uncomfortable to me 
0DuNMJcFCMxY7uzSDvy95Q CMU This is the first Starbucks brewing cafe I ve been to that asks you if you are dining in or taking out I said I was drinking my coffee in the cafe and I got a nice little cup for my espresso Yay for earth friendliness 
0e0BvwEbP_M2bZxyjTSJrA CMU This place was cool Ok ish Nothing lavish or anything Prices not so bad either It s a very chill environment where you can go and grab a drink and a bite to eat It s pretty spacious and typical of a pub Great service the servers and bartenders are all very nice funny and quick with your orders I ll probably go back again and sample all the beers another time And don t worry for you girly girls who don t drink beer they re a full bar so you can have whatever girly drink you want 3 stars Go try it 
0EmW-hajw6qazegIkdXQ8w CMU Great burger friendly staff lots of beer 
0euOyaK6tGyXsDjzuZDizA CMU Back to 4 stars The cask lines are in use regularly now and they linked a twitter feed to the website where they note when new beers come on tap Now fix the curry bring back the deviled eggs and we could be looking at 5 stars 
0E_m_dMZpjglwsPZoOe9xQ CMU My fav place to be outside in the summer in Cambridge No attitude laid back great beer and food I was impressed with the wine list and what they charge very fair Weekends are busy but midweek is nice to chill with a drink Food is pub grub but staff is great 
0F0UPnVtpIrkz5OZOAmFMw CMU I cannot understand why anyone would waste their money here Yes it s cheap for Harvard Square but if you re in the mood for beer and bar food spend a few more and go somewhere awesome like Russell House Tavern The food at John Harvards was awful even by bar food standards And they were out of 2 of the beers they only have a handful to begin with Maybe that was a blessing in disguise as they were out of the one that Mark O said tasted like cat pee The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that the service was great The servers were all smiles and I was asked several times by servers who weren t my original server if I needed another beer Gotta love a waitstaff that wants to keep your pint full 
0GVw6QDpSgB2SWeXZe5dhA CMU I m not really a beer person but I went here with friends and they got a beer tower which was truly awesome Never before have I seen anything like that I was torn on what to get on their menu but to play it safe I got their CBC Burger boy I was not disappointed at all They could have cooked the patty a bit more but either way it was very scrumptious The atmosphere was on the posh side which reminded me of a place that you would find in San Francisco Would definitely go here again but try something new 
0hfS9-Sjngc8rRmf6MkRYQ CMU love this place sort of limited menu mainly because I m trying to eat healthily this year burgers meatloaf chicken fingers fries not much else ALTHOUGH They have a great beer selection an awesome Apple Crisp dessert the prices are wonderful and they make a mean Long island Iced Tea ALSO ALSO How cold I have forgotten you must try the steak tips And their very spicy buffalo chicken salad So there IS a selection on the menu but hey I said I was trying to eat right If you want good comfort food and a great triple cheeseburger and waffle fries hit Charlies 
0hiIoEyAuPuicBsznYUPdQ CMU So back in high school I actually HAD a periodic table on my wall 7 feet by 10 feet with the Lanthanide series firmly in place where it BELONGS darn it It took me all day with butcher paper and sharpies and it rocked I was really excited about Miracle of Science because I had heard that THEY TOO had periodic table on their wall Needless to say I was disappointed by the lack of Science at the Miracle of Science Bar Grill Their menu was difficult to read somewhat limited burgers and beer and in an awkward position on a busy day no paper menus just the faux periodically arranged one on the wall Other than that the food was good Giant plate of fries giant burger my buddy got a giant plate of quesadilla that I thought was mediocre yet satisfying what can I say I had to finish it for him Is it overpriced Perhaps slightly but nothing major Pitcher of beer was cheap IIRC Total bill was 40 tip included Go here for satisfying food and a convenient location not science 
0ixs5LXK2yMspNlddmPuyg CMU This place sucks about as much as finding that 20 bill in your pocket after hungoverly pondering how in sam hill you spent so much money Pre hangover obviously you walk into this place and notice the huge bar wrapping around a fountain of beer taps I won t venture to guess how many beers but it is quite the selection Lots of Belgian and Belgian style refreshments my favorite being the Tripel Karmeliet I also enjoy the flights as variety is always awesome but there s definitely something for everyone there and I m no mead connoisseur but I thought it was good The food at this place is tasty as well I ve sampled the appetizers pickled veggies olives can t recall what else but they were all good I really like the bratwurst but my new favorite is probably the steak frites Especially the frites I could probably dine on those alone and be happy As for atmosphere service it usually seems to be packed so table service can be kind of slow but they re friendly enough As are the bartenders bartendresses You could come here with a group or sit at the bar by yourself with a book and feel comfortable all the same The bar is big enough that you re bound to strike up a conversation easily if you want Only thing I would dock them for is running out of glasses This happened once and it was annoying because it seemed like half of their beers or at least the ones I wanted were unavailable One great thing about them is that they serve their beer in specific glasses but if they run out of those glasses well that s it none of that beer for you until they clean said glass Keeping that in mind you should you still make your way to Meadhall in the People s Republic and have yourself some fine Belgian ales or mead if you so desire 
0jmCL7zRCPofuzzek-pJoQ CMU Come for the beer and love it 
0K0mrxqth2CDEJtHTpz39w CMU Place is pretty cool It is nice to have a place with such a large beer selection in the Kendall area I think there is something like 100 beers on tap here All ranging in different prices The place seemed to always be busy when I would get out of work Good place to go and casually have a couple of beers I like that the list is so long that you don t have to order the same kind You can experiment here The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about their beers One bartender took a sniff of my glass and was able to figure out what I was drinking after I had finished and couldn t remember what I had I haven t tried their food so I can t really say anything one way or the other on that But for a place to just stop in after work this place is great 
0Lj-VmYB68quH7UT6_vgOQ CMU Scale of 1 10 multiple visits 8 Food 7 Service 10 Atmosphere 7 Value 
0myM7tEoPzEPL3iCiEwQGg CMU I had an awesome burger here It is just my kind of place for great casual food Great quick service 
0O75HTq2i7hG1SAEb2oNxw CMU Miracle is great flat out and simple It s a bar that has surprisingly good food Easily the best burgers in Boston very meaty and nicely toasted buns Also the chicken quesadilla and chicken skewers are ridiculously moist even though they re made of white meat and grilled Oh and definitely go for two skewers even if you re not hungry the peanut chutney and the mint slaw are really worthwhile I was reading the review from the previous guy who was complaining no DEMANDING a host and printed menus Does Pour House have hostesses I mean come on it s a quality small neighborhood bar not L Espalier Oh and try a Nuts and Berries It s franjelico chambord amaretto and whole milk Looks and tastes like Ovaltine in a good way The girly loves it 
0OC6Ef0rGbGgvKBmYl5bHA CMU We went on a Saturday night in a group of 6 with the intentions of eating dinner and enjoying a beer or 2 at the bar while waiting for our table When we arrived there was not a long wait so we expected to be seated in 30 45 minutes After waiting over 2 hours and being told by the hostess that they only had one table which could accomodate a party of 6 we finally left to go find food elsewhere Meadhall needs to either plan for some 6 tops or 8 tops or learn how to push two tables together instead of telling people they cant seat parties over 4 So zero out of 5 stars for food and the hostess since we never got to try any When we took our seats at the bar I really enjoyed the length of the bar all of the taps and the HUGE beer listing on the chalkboard A for presentation Once we started ordering things went downhill My boyfriend ordered a beer which was on the chalkboard and was told it hadn t been tapped yet which was strange since some beers had already been kicked He ordered a different beer and everyone was happy When we tried ordering the 2nd round of beers my boyfriend was again denied as the glass wasn t available for the beer he wanted I understand wanting to serve the beer in the correct glass but you either need a better cleaning process so you don t run out of the right glass or you need to suck it up and pour it in a different glass You can t run bar when you refuse to tap kegs or serve beers because you didn t do the dishes 3 out of 5 for the bar aspect as theoretically there are a lot of choices and the beers I had were good Overall didn t meet expectations but with a little work could be a cool place 
0opresOONNsBLgjzDnbMtw CMU We hit up Tory Row on Friday night half expecting not to be able to get a table what with it being all new and posh Can I remind the Yelp community of the former occupant of Tory Row s new home A moment of silence please for the Greenhouse Cafe home of really great pie really terrible sevice and no bathrooms Tory Row does not have particularly large shoes to fill We were seated right away at a little table right up next to the front windows perfect for people watching Harvard Square is still the people watching Mecca of C bridge so its nice to have a new dining establishment that takes advanges of its awesome views of humanity My only beef was that the layout of the seating is a little awkward The tables seemed super close together I was kind of afraid that the oppressive mother father team at the table next to us was going to start asking me about my summer internship plans Also we ordered several plates and a bottle of wine to split three ways and the tiny cafe table top was barely able to accomodate our spread I guess the solution to that problem is stop being a fatass Anyway the food itself was delish The tomato basil mozzarella flatbread was devine and perfect for sharing When we d used up the fresh loaf of bread that came with our hummus plate the waitress gladly offered to bring us more so we could polish off the rest of the hummus The wide variety of brews and vinos also made for a good time And best of all when we d paid our check the waitress told us not to rush and feel free to hang out for awhile props for that There s nothing I hate more than being kicked to the curb immediately upon signing my reciept All and all a lovely night out Tory Row I shall return 
0OQe8zHsM5Q1MNdefSjH9A CMU Now that I ve been to Meadhall over a dozen times I finally used my time to enjoy a pricey entree I ve been informed by the owner of Meadhall and other great beer venues that great beer should be served with great food But between the sips of my Belgian Ale and the moans of satisfaction with the lamb shoulder WARNING must LOVE fat to enjoy this hunk of meat I couldn t help but scream inside for Meadhall to one up it on their service A place that wants more recognition for their edible offerings needs to provide excellent service to match their food drink I was shocked that we weren t given a serving of dinner rolls at our dinner table though the booth seats had them Then when I finished the duck sausage app I had cognitively put my dirtied fork and knife on the plate in anticipation of getting a clean set including a more knife y knife but when the waitress cleared the plates she asked don t you want to keep your knife and fork I kept the utensils reluctantly Also wasn t a huge fan of the lamb shoulder presentation wow before I was calling it duck what was I thinking which looked like a fat hockey puck Fortunately the flavors of the lamb with the fat the turnip puree and bacon chunks more than made up for its visual unappeal Last comment on the veggie burger which I m happy to see of the menu It was too mushy and mono textured to win my heart lentils and farro where re the veggies 
0pikbczTxx-AvPHSLgqanw CMU I ve been here a few times now This place is pretty good if all you re doing is drinking and all you re drinking is beer The place itself is pretty nice there are huge vats of beer in back which adds to the feel of the place I had the Mediterranean Plate most recently This was my only experience with food at the CBC and I shall not repeat it The plate was bland and small for the price The falafel on the plate was too mushy and cold and the tabouleh was tasteless The hummus was the one redeeming factor from the plate and even that was simply passable The beer however is very good I don t think I ve tried one there that I didn t like I ve had the sour ale the tall pale ale and a few of the pumpkin brews and each one has been quite good Come for beer and don t be tempted by the food 
0Q7SozDZl6wNRcbOO9XeBA CMU I have lived in the Boston area now for almost 4 years and I just visited Charlie s for the first time in March I have been really missing out I have been looking for a place like this in the area that isn t a chain and serves quality bar food and can you say cheap I am in love I went back again this week and had a cheeseburger which was amazing They have all different types of fries and burgers and great specials They also have an enormous beer menu which pleases all audiences If you are looking for a glass of nice wine and healthy dinner go elsewhere but if you are looking for a great burger that you can actually fit into your mouth sorry for the graphics go to Charlie s 
0qBu-Y-6adQIOt0nw9uXvg CMU I m not 100 sold yet on Tory Row but I think it has a lot of potential and Harvard Square needs a place like this especially with the passing of Z Square moment of silence I came here with a friend for a late ish lunch today He got mozzarella with fresh greens and I got the chicken pot pie The mozzarella was a little on the dry side and the salad a bit unsubstantial My friend was a bit disappointed given the price The chicken pot pie was less creamy and thick than I d expected but still tasted delicious The crust while not super flaky was also quite good Our drinks a lemonade and a limeade were excellent I like the layout here and the fact that the front windows open out to the street when the weather is nice The decor is clean and modern and while not especially warm is still inviting I think I might consider here for a few small dishes and a glass of wine with the girls or maybe a second date 
0Qd5BeYbuqfzk081YGGsXQ CMU I can t get enough of Miracle Every time I go which is becoming pretty much weekly the place is hopping Whether it be the weekend or a Tuesday night you can always expect to find a diverse crowd at Miracle Great prices on drinks food and their kitchen stays open pretty late as well That being said their menu is quirky and fun it s the periodic table The chicken skewers are FANTASTIC Easily the best bar food I ve ever had in the city My friends have all tried the burgers chicken sandwich salads and other items on the menu all to rave reviews A must do in Central Square 
0RJHoVd0POtnM3-skRdC0g CMU why write a review for a place that already has 121 reviews and you have nothing new to add well because i want to add this to my burger list it s 12 30 and obviously i m hankering for a burger and a beer where oh where does the kitchen not close before last call here that s where patties are flatties so you have to at least get a double fine by me plus i don t mind shoestring fries chicken fingers not so much for that charlie you and your kitchen have my interminable gratitude 
0R_lWdRIBPmcANj0P4HK5Q CMU The lackluster menu at John Harvard s is made up for by the high quality pub grub and chain bar grill selections This subterranean eating house is worth a visit as the ingredients are quality and supposedly this restaurant makes its own mayonaisse I can highly recommend the calamari with hot peppers and shallots meatloaf burgers and especially the fish chips If you go here definitely get one of their four regularly available beers There are only four available but they each are solid A bonus is that there are also seasonal special brews available year round This place is great for large groups so order pitchers 
0sAY8eWB_rToyxbdEeq5yA CMU Good food good drinks awesome people awesome waitresses D head managers Yup that s charlies in one crappy sentence I ve lived in Somerville for most of my life and have been drinking at Charlies since I got my first fake id if the cops are reading this I m just kidding you dumbasses Its a fun place to just chill and meet new faces The beer selections is average the food is pretty good but the best part are usually the waitresses who are all college level girls working part time and all have great down to earth attitudes It s an atmosphere that s not too over done and easy to enjoy The only issue I have with Charlie s is its manager s On several occasions they have enforced strange rules that just kinda leave you feeling awkward dirty inside The worst part is that they dont come and speak to you and explain things but just send a waitress to relay a message about a policy they know nothing about WHILE the manager stands 10 feet away Why can t he just come over and talk to the customers themselves instead of just standing there like an evil overlord or future nazi party leader I work in marketing and customer communications and that kind of stuff is the dumbest Sh T you can do and makes things feel unfriendly at Charlies In Conclusion Beer Selection B Food B Waitresses A Customers A Managers D heads 
0T9xujQF-kQXu03AZIgiRg CMU I ve only been to Shay s during the summer and usually at the most random of times for drinks only That being said I thought Shay s was very cozy The words gleaming dazzling or classy do not come to mind when I think of Shays but it s comfortable and relaxing I didn t find anything truly remarkable about Shays but any place where I can veg with friends for hours rates well in my books 
0td1zC2LgGdiMUd5wgD4qQ CMU I don t get out to Cambridge much as I generally stick to my side of the river but Charlie s Kitchen has given me a reason to visit the other side again soon Charlie s is a simple laid back pub environment with a great menu that has lots of vegetarian options Beers are cheap and food is good Perhaps the best part is the patio With the warm weather coming back Charlie s has a vast outdoor patio so that you can eat and drink outside 
0TLe4AM9e8Wx2bhrqBCs-w CMU I stopped in here for a late lunch eating at the bar Service was prompt and efficient The beers were good and I liked the glasses they were served in I also liked the lobster roll The look of the place is great sleek and modern and the atmosphere is friendly and lively while still managing to be fairly relaxed I liked eating at the bar but it would be fun to come with friends too 
0U5z4RiaCCy5HuLz4yA6Bg CMU Everything about this place was perfectly good but nothing was particularly outstanding There s a good beer list and the three pints I had were good but not striking The food was plenty good and hit the spot after I spent all day hiking around Boston Cambridge If I m ever it the MIT area again and finding myself in need of food drink I ll happily come back here but I don t think I d make a special trip Also can I just say as a tourist that the One Kendall Square address is ing impossible to find I know Cambridge types are smart but throw us tourists a bone gorram it 
0uh5HfR9kE6Sxva2LjE3iA CMU i rolled in here the other night for a tight double cheeseburger and fries i ordered a Steel Rail too The steel rail tasted funny We also got the appetizer combo which was two crusty mozz sticks 2 wings and 2 chicken fingiz The wings were whack the chicken fingiz were whatevs and they both looked like they came out of a frozen food section in the supermarket Then I got my burger and the burgers were small and greased up It wasn t a thick juicy burger like I expected I was already down about 20 dollars including tip for just that I realized that if I started drinking more brews there I d wind up paying 50 bucks for what I could have done with a 6 pack of PBR and a McDonalds It s about the same It was whack guy I could have bought a half 1 8 of some sticky icky with that 20 bucks and chilled hard 
0V8AjIlk5HZ7lQoQed3fSA CMU Great spot to grab a quick lunch or dinner I had the grilled chicken sandwich with habanero mango mustard It was great Also served with really good seasoned potatoes instead of fries Food and service was quick but quality was definitely not compromised Meals ranged from about 9 15 Would definitely go back 
0vaEfASacrljmd9Peyxj1Q CMU I work in Kendall Sq A colleague recommended so thought this would be a great place to go Yelp has it as but I would make it The venue is great Wide open space Great huge bar area And when the weather is nice they ll have all the windows open Having worked in Kendall Sq for quite some time I really welcome this place Kendall Sq is finally coming to life with a bunch of new restaurants and bars 
0w8VHdeTypQVMLMJr-icPQ CMU Last Sunday night following a rousing viewing of The Town at Harvard Square my friends and I went in search of a spot that would make us forget that the world at large sees us as their crime ridden gray filtered crackwhore capital We went to Tory Row and were happily surprised to find it both warm toned and civilized despite the fact that beyond name and font there s nothing remotely British about this place and exceedingly yummy considering I d never really heard much about it since it moved into prime H Square real estate To imbibe while 5 50 pints of Harpoon Octoberfest warmed my heart and the 15 pitchers of high quality ales stroked my soul I was particularly won over by the vessels in which they served the beer Who knew how much more satisfying a beverage could be when drunk from a stout thin walled glass To nosh I had the duck confit salad which was a true winner The duck was a tender shaved little pile atop a few toasts next to a heaping dollop of grainy mustard holding court next to a generous pile of greens crisp pickled shallots and splendorous little bursts of poached cherry I love it when I discover flavors that I never would have thought to put together all blending harmoniously upon the tongue So good Why is this place not more on the radar Mayhaps due to the consistent shower of bullets and relationships based on deception that we Bostonians deal with daily I mean pish who s got time to deal with anything as trivial as food 
0wOzM9sCm7HGSuDo003raA CMU Bartender had no clue how to make a simple cosmo and the pour for scotch was a joke It was not only us the patrons next to us watched the bartender reviewing notes to make a manhaten and still had to add liquor to the drink after it barely made the halfway point in the glass Trying to be young and hip with overpriced meals and poor service I guess if you are young and hip and like to overpay to watch the service admire themselves or read their crib notes on drinkology this is your place We ordered tuna sushimi with salad No chop sticks and no salad Not coming back 
0W_Oq-k6aMOQZCxX3Zyq-Q CMU I really can t say that I gave this place much of a chance I stopped in for a couple beers and probably didn t spend more than 40 minutes inside But I always have an opinion to share First of all it s in Harvard square so don t expect a reasonably priced pour from this place One draft beer was 5 50 That s a bit steep It was only Sierra Nevada Second the outside patio area is sunken by a few feet so people watching is reduced to watching people s ankles I did see some hot ankles however Lastly they served a mexican type menu which really threw me off Nothing in the title would suggest such a style but hey whatever works I ate elsewhere 
0xwSYjiEbSUuR5yKB2vJDw CMU In the heart of MIT campus and trying to blend right in giant menu in the design of the periodic table on the wall Good burgers and solid beer selection Can get a bit crowded on weekends with not much place to stand but a pleasant vibe and a good place to people watch 
0z0uEQH1LEWomH0cAhmR8w CMU perhaps my favorite place that s close to mit i always bring out of town guests here its just the right place to get a glimpse of cambridge although the vegetable skewers are not delicious i always seem to forget how rancid the blue cheese dressing while i m there and order them anyways ugh best to stick with the veggie burgers 
0z1hAawNqjKvbG6kS1lxNQ CMU unimpressive except for the waffle fries which remind me of what they sell at chick fil a which should excite the suburban reared among us including your humble servant the buffalo wings came off some really skinny chickens and they serve them with dressing packaged in plastic envelopes the burger patties are so school cafeteria the lettuce is iceberg and the tomato slices are tiny the waitress was however quite attentive and the hef on tap was cold and satisfying 
0ZbqGPgQFAydL_bVsWE09g CMU I sampled 4 of their beers prior to dinner with my fianc We also got their tavern pretzels Very enjoyable atmosphere and good beer I could see myself coming back here frequently if I actually lived in the area 
10AmJ8C1n8vxem5hn7LnRw CMU The beef skewers are good and can be constructed into an actual wrap The only menu is on the wall in periodic table form very clever Burger is good size and tasty Good beer selection Recommend pitcher of Brooklyn lager or bottle of harpoon It gets crowded by the window so snag the table under to menu if you don t mind people looking over your head In the summer they open the large window in the back and it really opens the place up A nice balance between real cheap college grub and expensive executive cuisine 
11su_Q0n1oBWynhvnGHzHg CMU Lord Hobo a classic oxymoron understood by the droves of Cantabrigian academics who appreciate their literary phenomena along with a good beer This sleek dark gastropub opened in November to much fanfare and high expectations as the successor of B Side lounge and I have to say it s a welcome addition to the local scene It s as if the B Side stopped hanging out with the retro indie punk gang it was a member of went to college and studied abroad in Europe saw a few Coldplay concerts quit the late nights and white powders and bought a few polo shirts but still kept some of its edgy side THE BEER Here you ll find an absolutely insane selection of great beers on tap think Sint Bernadus Bear Republic Allagash and Synebrychoff proclaimed as the best porter in the world and brewed in Finland A selection for snobby beer lovers indeed I was happy THE FOOD Higher end comfort foods typical of a gastropub menu charcuterie plates mussels meat pie chips etc I ve sampled the true shepherd s pie a monstrous lamb meat creation that was tasty but far too large to eat in one sitting I ve tried the burger a juicy beauty topped with aged Irish cheddar and sandwiched between two slices of peppered challah The chips are pretty respectable and they serve up some different specials such as fried BBQ sweetbreads FYI this is a gland in a cow s neck not a bread in case you were wondering So the B side s preppy cultured beer loving cousin is a good time The beer menu here is welcome however I leave wanting a little more from the food Ultimately this place is best enjoyed off hours over a vigorous sampling of beers Pick at the brew paired appetizers and take hefty bites out of their burger Prost 
14Fof4H2ZDP01Nk-MqizZw CMU MEH I realize that ABP is meant to be someplace to grab a quick bite and is not fine dining The food is consistently OK but never great even for a quick bite The service is consistently bad The last 3 times I ve gone in I ve ordered one of the standard sandwiches but with some small change different bread no mayo For some reason this caused the sandwich maker to call an all company meeting behind the counter to figure out what to do with my sandwich I don t understand why not putting mayo on my sandwich is a life altering decision for these people If that wasn t enough nobody ever speaks Unless the manager is nearby its unlikely anyone says Hello Have a nice day or even That will be 7 99 The food gets 3 stars but the people service only get 1 
14Q7bIq3yUZ1Z9J3_BpvAQ CMU Dark dingey and full of good times best describes my experiences here at John Harvards The food here is excellent and the beer selection is f ing awesome The Nut Brown Ale is stellar Thumbs up to our server Dave who gave us all souvenir Pub glasses for being from California 
15CXVWRYJCGDEIJzkHEgtA CMU Charlie s is the place to go Outside There is the imposing out of place facade of the building complete with multicolored lights on the sign and just weird shit and sayings all over the place It s the only place I ve seen in Harvard Square that attempts no semblance of class whatsoever They have a patio but you can t smoke out there Downstairs You walk in the door on the left past the decrepit lobster tank GOD knows why they have that and seat yourself I usually don t have trouble finding a booth or table to sit at even during busy times Our waitress came right up to us and was extremely friendly and I have had the same great service outside AND at the bar Food The food is good strong bar food at reasonable prices A double cheeseburger with fries and a pickle is 5 25 and it tastes like a tasty burger should I would recommend opting for waffle fries 50 extra because their fries sort of look like uncooked Potato Stix The specialty burgers are 8 10 and there are about a dozen or more They also have vegan veg and fish options all of which are pretty good Salmon burger in particular Drinks MIXED DRINKS ARE 3 75 Yes they are Tasty mixed drinks in a good sized glass for the lowest price I ve found in this town Thank heavens Also they have great beer including a fine selection of Belgians They even have a sampler for 5 where they give you 6 oz of 4 different beers and a glass of water I got this once and the bartender said We re out of water so you re getting another beer I almost kissed her ps they were not out of water Upstairs I associate the upstairs with ordering a gigantic Hoegaarden in a special crispy glass that I love to hold and hold again I also associate the upstairs with kids crowding the tables and loud music It s hit or miss up there but that beer is so good It s a great place to hang out with friends or even just get dinner by yourself Fun funny and awesome is Charlie s They accept cards 
16IvVPxRaJHjgTKPZymeDw CMU If I could give it 0 stars I would have more of an appropriate review Yesterday with my roommate I had a few drinks at Miracle of Science We had to wait 20 minutes for a glass of wine and a beer that was sitting at the counter that was 8 ft away Instead of delivering them she would make other people drinks but common service would make it where she would take the 30 seconds to deliver our drinks The waitress didn t deliver them so my roommate finally took them himself and she gave him a bad look I was very annoyed for being rude to him at so I said wow great customer service Minutes later she was complaining to the guy bartender and pointing and looking at us rude and she put both of our drinks on his tab without asking us he had two beers before I arrived so we did not arrive as a party as they claimed we did I asked for change to pay my roommate back in cash and the bartender said roughly In this bar you need to be not rude and polite otherwise we don t want you here There is no more discussion about this Thus I STRONGLY recommend you not to support this bar I usually really like local bars but I never had such rude customer service in my life Even in France where people complain about customer service I never had anything like this I would suggest many of the other bars around Central Sq if you are in that area 
17MhFlaSNoNWuHufrMz-kQ CMU How can I best describe Tory Row I guess the word adequate comes to mind Which is a shame because walking past the storefront in Harvard Square it seems as though it has SO much potential It s not exactly the neighbourhood full of the hippest joints in town but Tory Row looks pretty cool from the outside with its minimalist navy frontage you feel like it s a place for the beautiful people Unfortunately it s let down by the food and service not the clientele or decor I ordered the lobster salad and my friend ordered the veggie burger and like I said they were adequate not good not bad The real WTF moment came when our order of broccoli rabe appeared Just to be clear I am a big fan of broccoli rabe in fact broccoli is definitely on my top 5 list of vegetables Sadly this one smelt and tasted like it had been steeped in sulphur My friend was brave enough to take a bite and immediately regretted that decision We finally got the attention of the waitress and explained that it seemed like there was something wrong with the rabe Her unenthusiastic response was A lot of people really just don t like the broccoli rabe She removed the offensive item from the table but failed to remove it from the bill Here is my question if a lot of customers are complaining about the item then why is it still on the menu and how are you still charging people 4 for it Boo to Tory Row for poor service mismanagement of the menu and for trying to poison customers with questionable vegetables 
19gnjXa0-AJja5qRMBrSgA CMU Give me a small divey bar and I m happy Give that bar fun friendly staff and I m happier Add an awesome beer selection and I m really happy Throw in some outdoor seating with great people watching opportunity and I m all kinds of happy 
1AXmwBfqXcFuiy9cuU1UNA CMU Great beer 100 selections on tap prices not to shabby food on the other hand so so 
1chVRNguCpQ2NP6gZ6DE_A CMU Dearest Harvest I used to think you were cool But like Abercrombie and Fitch that you model you bar after one eventually realizes that you are just overpriced hype the service the past two times I have walked in your door has been comparable to ordering at a McDonald s counter Matter of fact flat superficial and the bare minimum to get you in and out the hosts not acknowledging customers coming in or out of the establishment just a bonus an extra star for being the first place since college that I have ever left less than 1 a drink for a bartender Kudos my business moves elsewhere 
1CiIAHNkWViuWjXpu8Dk8g CMU Decent atmosphere but they could do a lot more with the place honestly Yummy burgers and fries 8 And the beers were okay A bland experience but the staff was very friendly 
1DLGtQkFf9dcM3N-wBc2eA CMU The bar itself is very slow The food here is AWFUL I ordered a caeser salad and was thoroughly disappointed I just got two huge hearts of lettuce with very little dressing This was a while ago but it was enough to convince me to never eat here again 
1g5wm_ZgXmPdfueUnJW4sw CMU Another one of the quintessential bar spots in Cambridge near MIT It screams nerdy with its periodic table theme menu Its totally worth checking out simply to say you ve been there But besides the check the box factor for Bostontonians there s not much else to say My friend Tom would probably not go there because he s not a nerd Heaven for hipsters 
1gScVb1So7tmfDrNK-rKrA CMU If I lived in Cambridge I d be here all the time Went there with some co workers last night for a few beers after work The beer selection is amazing and I tried some beers I ve never had or heard of We also ordered some truffle fries that were outstanding Started to fill up around 7 so I d recommend getting there a little earlier if you want a table 
1gUQ4nAYPjMXaVMSN-cUKw CMU Fine pub Charming especially if you can get a table 
1H2VyvRK3FZH3oGdhMRP7Q CMU Glass of Grenache PEI mussels cheeseburger med rare croque monsieur fritatta with onions and cheddar The wine was excellent the mussels were plump and served in a delicious broth of garlic and spices Unfortunately the fritatta was finished for an additional10 minutes beyond necessary it was definitely dry The croque monsieur was lacking a b chamel sauce I suppose the traditional definition of the sandwich does not necessitate the inclusion of b chamel but I have come to expect it I didn t ask so my mistake Cheeseburger was good Otherwise like it like it all Simple quick service fun atmosphere Good people watching Pitchers of beer carafes of wine 
1h6dRRhJ46KXqEXj5BqrFA CMU This place was pretty much just alright The service was abysmal I think me and my friend waited 20min for water another 30 for appetizers and seriously 45 minutes for the check after we had asked The servers are just really distant and aloof Food was not bad at all flat bread is pretty good as is the rigatoni It s not outrageous or anything but its fine 
1HkF-c6vA-oNrT_pp7bZSA CMU I avoided Charlie s for the longest time because I figured people who occasionally tucked their shirts in were not allowed I was wrong 4 dollar Crown and Cokes and nobody cornered me and made me untuck my shirt I will definately be back 
1HrMdUlPoatBY2IwY23lUg CMU Not sure if the management reads reviews on yelp but I am imploring you to please put some new items on the menu The bf happens to LOVE miracle burgers and so we go quite often especially since we are within a stone s throw at MIT But you can have the same burgers quesadillas hummus plate grilled veggie meats boring salads for only so many years and I am a PhD student who has been around a long time and has even more years ahead I am sick to death of every single item on the menu and so it s become a real drag to go there What I m asking is for a bit more variety like crab cakes devils on horseback chicken pot pie maybe a fish option even if its casually dressed 
1IRajEhfjLqr7V7aMMAy3Q CMU Pro Cheap Con Food is gross Pro Cheap Con Service ain t great Pro Cheap Con Too loud Pro Cheap Con Fail on good dive atmosphere The feng shui is off no matter where I m sitting here I feel uncomfortable Pro Beer garden achieves genuine cheap and cheerful One extra star for the beer garden Otherwise go to Grendel s or Hong Kong to get your cheap on in the Harvard Square area 
1IvBadCdoQ-wpJguu6hWfA CMU Having been at MIT for 6 yrs it s hard not to go to Miracle of Science MOS like we call it it serves a decent burger hummus and quesadillas Great place to have lunch or a beer The people there are fairly young early 20s and they have their menu on a periodic table 
1jDn5zQZuFy2z1ujSIyHfg CMU CLOSED the bad food caught up with it I do miss the staff though they were always freindly to me and some of them worked there when it was lees Oh well Failing food Failing business 
1KOeVJkqaJrn4d1hXPzhNw CMU Great beer selection although nothing extremely rare Menu was unexciting and the preparation was terrible Waitstaff was not knowledgable of food or beer In fact our waiter wasn t even of legal drinking age 
1kwaGlCPklT9ttlCKJLeeg CMU Reggae music outdoor seating chill staff interesting beverages haven t eaten there yet but I pretty much love this place already 
1L9fI0fj4DL7Qa_QXUM8dg CMU Decent burgers decent beer Good time with friends Nothing that memorable or mind blowing 
1LsIRQfS4mSQ04l9XD_YPg CMU If you re looking for artery cloggers this is the place And I don t mean that in the negative sense They re selection of cheese burgers is abundant The single burger may be a tad smaller than you r expect that s why I recommend a double or even a triple Good luck Oh and great selection of draft beers on tap too 
1mVJId2ghYPjzMpNsjvjTA CMU When I lived in Btown this was the place For the under 30 over 18 crowd Best double cheeseburgers on the planet Terrific bartenders with true wit A jukebox And taxis abound right out the door Not the ideal locale for a quiet hipster free night 
1nlxwnyJbJOP9wp7hrJeqw CMU I came here expecting a good burger but the burger I got was cold bland and the cheese was not melted which would have been ok if the meat was warm but I ended up eating a congealed mass on a soggy meh bun They could have given a bit more pickle a couple slices is stingy for a 9 burger The waitress also charged me an extra dollar than the menu price but to her credit she immediately changed it when I showed her the error The bright side the fried green beans were great But alas not great enough to warrant a return visit next time I find myself in Cambridge 
1orxaqy9N5g2L9iLoJFPyw CMU For what it is you can t really beat it An old school 17th century establishment or so says there sign outside exposed rock walls great lighting stained glass with famous harvard folks faces where saints should be and really really good beer Last night I had the stout and it might even beat guiness in my book I d like more options on the menu or rather more light options everything s very heavy and will leave you with a brick in your stomach but I almost don t even care I don t go there for the food but for the vibrancy of the scene 
1PSiokk_3qfI6-lht27D-Q CMU I used to love this place when it first opened but now I think it s totally over The validated parking is totally hit or miss The manager takes no responsibility for it so you are forced to deal with the parking garage people Guess what They re not there late at night and if you don t live nearby you have to make a special trip to the garage to sort it out or suck it up and pay the 20 Not cool I ve had some great servers here but I ve also had some bad ones I ate here on August 14th and was seated at a table by myself where I waited for the two other members of my party to arrive The server never came over to take a drink order from me as I sat there waiting even though he was tending to the other tables surrounding me Rude Then when the other two people showed up it took him another five minutes to approach the table and he totally ignored me as he proceeded to take their drink orders Very strange considering I was the only woman at the table and call me old fashioned but it s impolite to ignore the woman at the table and not allow her to order first Manners get some You might be a new waiter but you were definitely old enough to have some common sense The food everyone ordered was good so no complaints there but by the time we ordered our last drink the waiter had all but disappeared I have no plans to come back here ever again I m giving it two stars because I think the food can be really great and they have an awesome beer selection What kills it for me is dealing with clueless servers and the hassle of the validation for the parking garage If you don t care about what kind of service you get and you don t drive here then this probably doesn t apply to you There are so many other places to eat and drink in this city that it doesn t make sense for me to waste my time and money here 
1qts9EEVJ0nNOFppR6IUXA CMU Really enjoy dining here Great staff Great food The truffle fries are so YUMMMM 
1rTZy49HLHI2i7krpyltWA CMU Went for birthday festivities with some of my husband s classmates I was starving had a cheeseburger Ordered medium got well done inside and charcoal outside The burnt taste distracted from the rest of the otherwise delicious burger The side potatoes were a w e s o m e Ambiance was fun it was overall a good night 
1S1rYANXMutlR_d6DkrqLg CMU I ve come here after work a few times over the years and I think last week was my last I just don t like their beer any of them in fact The heifewiezer i know I killed the spelling has a terrible after taste regatta golden is just eh and another one that I cant remember the name tastes like bad coffee The food is nothing special especially when looking for simple after work eats Basically not a great appetizer menu The outside is nice but since I usually dont have a good drink to go with it I m not really enjoying it 
1sAUmp0A4L-peM2vcReR0g CMU Looking for a greasy diner near the heart of Harvard Square Bingo Come here for a cheap meal price and perhaps quality and you will get what you are looking for Burger Sure Grilled cheese or pulled pork Not a good idea 
1SawN8cEKFfVzZtCZzVqdA CMU Beware if you are a hungry drinker with gym guilt If you are like me you get hungry after a few drinks Sure you may have eaten hours ago but its like the drinks have broken down all the food in your stomach and you are left with a huge gaping food void and suddenly your brain goes Hey WTF I m not full anymore I wandered into Charlie s Kitchen with a few friends on a Friday night Elbowed my way into the standing room only crowd and got up to the bar unaware of the sneaky temptations that awaited me Standing and chatting with my friends and occasionally getting tossed around when someone walked by me I had a couple of tasty beers The bartender was quick and despite the crowd we never played the stare until you make eye contact game Then suddenly a plate of burgers and fries went right by my head In the hand of a waitress of course I was done for I don t even know what happened the rest of the conversation I was too conflicted I want a cheeseburger I just went to the gym today In the end I didn t go with the cheeseburger Or fries Or chicken I went with a Stella which I am sure has a lot less calories Tip Upstairs you have to walk through a door to get to the girls room door Confusing for a newbie 
1T9zioupDRLsfkgRao2Xzg CMU I ve hit up the CBC many a time following softball games and I m always amazed at their ability to seat an entire softball team usually within a few minutes So they definitely earn major props for that Although when I ve gone there in small parties I ve often had much longer waits However I assume it varies on a night by night basis In addition to the usually prompt seating when escorted by a hoard of bat wielding librarians anyway CBC also offers some really great food I ve tried a bunch of things on the menu and I feel that I have yet to go wrong with any of my choices The pulled pork sandwich is one of the best I ve had in the Boston area the pizzas are great and their burgers are incredible Although let s be honest here the main reason I love CBC can be summed up in two words tower race CBC serves all of their homemade brews in a 100 oz tower Often times the tower serves as a large groups answer to ordering multiple pitchers Other times the tower serves as a means of competition and liver debilitation 
1Tb9i_wsxzM2XdkjHZBmPw CMU I was so excited to go to this place sent several friends there thinking it s gonna be so good Sadly not so good Hipster in that hipster way that means if you aren t hip you get dissed And pricey 13 for a cubano w no fries The cubano Chez Henri which has one best of Boston 4 times is only an additional 1 The stars are for the beer selection which is excellent 
1Tk9J7FRBP7lNW_XNoAi2Q CMU Went to Tory Row for the first time for Saturday brunch My French toast was decent but my boyfriend was disappointed in his steak and egg tacos they were not really cooked at all It s a great open atmosphere with shared long tables we sat next to British tourists who were totally enamored with the bar and Harvard Square in general Also stopped in on Saturday evening to see friends having drinks there and it still had a great vibe Overall Harvard Square needs less random shops and more bars restaurants like Tory Row for locals and tourists alike 
1TqH1oFM9v6RNJj3xS_5NQ CMU Roomy with reliable food John Harvard s is a great bet for groups for dinner or drinks 
1uJv6wODPEnuewGYA-qkvQ CMU I ve been here a few times back in the day when Anna was still working there we miss you Anna She s great intelligent dry humor attentive everything you could ask for from a good bartender We always drank ate at the bar This place is brought to you by the Miracle of Science MOS folks Which is what got me through the door in the first place Found they had Leffe beer on tap so I stayed The bad Leffe is one beer that comes in tiny glasses probably a price point thing Frankly I d rather have them charge me more but give me a normal glass Food tries to be fancy but ends up being mediocre Not at all like MOS my go to burger joint If you want food I d suggest going around the corner to Cambridge 1 also owned by them for the best chicken pizza in Cambridge Anyway I d recommend sitting at the bar for a quick beer chatting with the friendly patrons before moving onto somewhere else for dinner 
1vAq8XJxN2Kp1k4se6FZ3Q CMU If you give me my bill and the entree simultaneously and the place isn t crowded and you don t do the same to anyone else then I ma think something s up When I called the waitress on it she fumbled said that was the policy with everyone is it Again I didn t see it happen to anyone else But if it s happened to you and I m overreacting I m happy to note that We were not being obnoxious or loud or blaring ridiculous music about pimps and hos I m stymied why this gaffe was thrown into an otherwise ordinary and fine ish lunch Had the pseudo Cobb salad which was only missing chicken avocado and an egg but for the way it was priced it should ve had those things I contemplated the burger but without fries Just can t seem to get with the marriage of burger and glorified home fries I m all set Tory Row Deuces 
1VfLvdC1_j-bi11UTr7_ug CMU Good burgers great beer list and big open windows make Miracle of Science a perfect choice for a lazy summer evening The nerd chic accoutrements just sweeten the deal 
1vyVkPcxiu3sew0xq7s-8Q CMU Awesome beer selection Check Sweet patio seating Check The best french toast in town CHECK I m not even a big fan of french toast but CBC s french toast might have changed my life I came this close to kidnapping the man in the kitchen responsible for doling out that sweet savory ohsobuttery party in my mouth The rest of brunch was also delicious The lox was served on perfectly pillow y yet dense homemade English muffins and the freshly made doughnuts were da bomb diggidy The menu changes seasonally and it always features local produce meat and cheese CBC is definitely a spot worth checking out over and over again especially on Sundays Chef Jon knows how to work it at Beerrrunch 
1x2qFjZwbolaR01U5zggGg CMU Meow meow Bratwurst excellent Perfect pre game snack Tons of beers Cool layout Friendly Staff Where else you gonna go in Kendall Sq This place rocks 
1x6L5_SjWOWZ-G1PFEE3wQ CMU My review is on the basis that this is a classy restaurant If it were a regular bar it d be 4 stars Note compared to the other reviews I don t think you need to dress up Regular skirt outfit and nice sweater for guys works for lunch Table next to us were in jeans Older crowd wore khaki slacks Food Great 4 5 stars Came in for a late brunch Was intrigued by the pork buns with kimchi and had to try it My boyfriend had the rigatoni Pork buns first taste felt as if all of the flavors were having a war Second bite good After the second bite I was sold I can t describe it with any other words than fun It s a fun fusion dish for those interested in fusion Rigatoni Not amazing but very good Good balance of meat and cheese topping Dessert 4 stars Flour less tort AMAZING Plus they use taza chocolate It was very decadent Espresso Creme Brulee decent For me it was a bit too rich and buttery I felt as if I needed some kind of bubbly drink to settle my stomach We both could not finish it Service Here s the problem 1 5 stars Great seating service Staff was friendly and got us a corner seat We came around 4PM so there were only about 13 customers 8 at the bar and 2 tables Problem was our waiter 1 It takes him around 10 15 minutes to realize that we might need something After our lunch we had to ask another staff member who was splitting a 4 seater into 2 seating table for the dessert menu I mean after 20 minutes we were pretty ready for either dessert or wine 2 He didn t show up again after dessert He did walk across the small area where customers were all seated since it s pre dinner we were all in one area When we raised our hand for service he seemed to see right past us about twice I didn t understand since all we wanted was our check After about 15 minutes after the second walk past I had to get up and ask the person at the front for my check because my boyfriend had a schedule Classy or sketch So other than the waiter being unavailable I felt a bit creeped out by his attention to the table next to us I noticed that he would ignore all of the 4 tables with customers for 15 20 min at a time BUT one table got amazing service That table was the table next to ours Three undergrad girls were seated there He checked up on this table twice as frequently as other tables Always checking with them when he had to deal with the rest of us They also received dessert menus and checks on time I originally just thought the wait staff was busy I mean 5 tables to wait on from 4 6 might be difficult But he always managed to chat for 5 minutes with this table to our left Afterwards my boyfriend and I began to bet how long he d chat whenever he stopped by their table I mean we knew we would have to wait around ten minutes for the guy to show up again to get our order anyways The sad part business wise was that even though he could spend 5 min to chat with the girls about their dishes he did not have a minute to glance and see if there were problems at the other 4 tables General comments We really like the food We are going to go back for the onion soup and burger I wouldn t say it s completely upscale but we were there for late brunch Service would have been decent except for the fact that our waiter was a bit non existent unless he was entertaining us with his attention to the table of three girls I ll update this review next time Hopefully the service will be different 
1XCixhbOR2e9veIs3Yi_hg CMU Redline is a decent venue just a bit on the small side Came here for the first time a week before my half birthday and then picked this as my 1 2 birthday celebration destination Food is pretty good and around 11pm is when they move all the tables away and it becomes the dance floor The drinks at the bar are made well and there is a decent mix of people I think the Redline is either hit or miss depending what night you go and who the DJ is what the DJ is spinning I tend to like the top 40 hip hop songs that were played when I was there for the 1 2 birthday celebration a Saturday but wasn t really feelin the vibe when I was there on a Friday and the bar was FAR less crowded No coat check so people tend to pile up their coats on whatever ledge is available This makes me a bit nervous what if someone takes my coat by mistake But it s better than lugging my coat around all night 
1XRuouJTSfY_gcUwKEwHXw CMU Wow Got a Dine Gift certificate from a friend when I moved to Boston I chose Harvest knowing I d have to pay more than the amount of my certificate But I m so glad I did It allowed me to experience an exquisite meal For starters we had butternut squash soup with trumpet mushrooms pears and creme fraiche and the charcuterie platter The soup was so flavorful made with excellent squash and presented well Our server poured it at the table on the mushrooms pears and creme so that it didn t dissolve before I got it Only negative there was some sand on the mushrooms Every item on the charcuterie platter was impressive the best cornichons I ve tasted a whole grain violet mustard it was all well done The pate was unique and excellent but aside from cherries and a bit of ham I m not sure what else made for the great flavor Dinner continued to impress The lamb came with preserved lemon gnocchi who knew lemon gnocchi would be so exciting The duo of beef shoulder and short rib made me love beef Braised short ribs were served on greens and were melt in your mouth tender marinated to perfection The greens however were too salty for my taste The beef shoulder was served on quality potatoes diced and mashed with herbs and I think sour cream Good ingredients can make all the difference It made simple potatoes an amazing experience We ended dinner with banana creme brulee which was so good As we reached the cooler parts of the dessert the banana flavor came out and was a perfect ending to the meal Service was attentive They were always there to refill our water or wine glasses Time between courses was not too fast or too slow While always present to help service was not intrusive All in all I wish I could afford to eat like this all the time 
1Xu9y8v7C82v4hRhzkcJRQ CMU For some reason I ve had several first dates here in the last two years Maybe it s the men I choose but I would have never thought of coming here on my own Fast forward one year and I find myself here once again on a Friday night meeting someone new I m thinking it s the non threatening vibes I m thinking it s just easy atmosphere while still managing to be somewhat quaint I m thinking it s really hard to date someone that is a Yelper and a judgmental one at that But according to about 10 different people I need to be a YES girl So I said yes met up and I had fun at Shays Upon walking in the bouncer was reading Dave Eggers I immediately begun chatting him up about the book and learned that oh this place is kinda cool I found my date or maybe he found me and I ordered some wine The selection is really good for such a small place and they have an equally vast beer selection Happily holding my Shiraz we went over to a booth area and chatted away for several hours Although the one annoying thing is the noise levels The music which was really good and ranging from Bon Iver to the Grizzy Bears was so loud at some points I was literally screaming to be able to be heard Maybe Shays is intentionally doing this so date s just have to be up in each others faces to speak into each others ears which was done several times Either way I was charmed Not so much by my date but by Cambridge s local little dive y pub I ll be back to sit on that porch in the Summer 
1xWAvSNOSWFQzOg1UYTJdQ CMU Shay s is a really cool place to hang out with friends if you can get in This a small bar with a lot of fans My favorite thing about Shay s though is getting a Hot Toddy in the winter Warms you right up on those freezing New England nights 
1yvMwH03ccc220_ep0657A CMU Ok but need more variety of Brews Granted their beer is good and their dark is about as good as Guinness but when I want a Guinness I can t get it here Try Cambridge common on mass instead for a great selection Good nachos 
1zglCOaFxngJGVzYOsESEg CMU If you want to stay smack dab in Harvard Square this is a good choice for drinks wine beer in a semi chic setting especially during the warmer months when the window doors fully open letting in a nice breeze That said the long tables mean you ll be very close to your neighbors and I m not a huge fan of the atmosphere of the place it has a more cold industrial feeling rather than being warm and cozy And there doesn t seem to be a lot of character e g the lighting is functional but boring The noise level is perfect until later in the evening when they turn up the music volume and it becomes difficult to talk across the table There s an interesting food selection that goes beyond burgers and a decent wine selection 
1zTqiLZ1wvkiQtTBi2MJ4A CMU Summed up This is a modern mid priced restaurant with a robust drink selection and trendy American cuisine Overall it is a pleasant place to grab a drink and snack I went here with my husband and a friend and had a flatbread pizza and grilled asparagus The other two had bacon cheese burgers with grilled potatoes and a spicy ketchup The food was tasty not amazing but very tasty If you re looking for a quiet or cozy restaurant there are definitely better choices The modern in my initial sentence refers to the attractive clean lines and cushion free IKEA like chairs The lack of fabric made the acoustics fine for a night out with friends but tough for an intimate date or gathering One big plus They have several nice high top tables in the center of the room which would be good for groups 
1ZYYs9095nZDqG5eVs8-Lw CMU Pleasant seems to be the most apt word to describe Tory Row My review is actually closer to 3 5 stars just because my Croque Monsieur was rich gooey and yummy and they had Molson s on tap which made my day However the rest of the menu seemed really erratic and over priced Having tried other spots in Harvard Square I doubt I ll make it back to this place on my own but if someone suggested it I d probably go back without an argument 
1_1hd5XJoggnPZmuuY9Apw CMU This is the most reasonably priced restaurant I have been to so far in Boston I stopped by here for brunch and then watched the World Cup Finals I had the egg sandwich which consisted of 2 fried eggs 3 4 sliced sausage links between english muffin w chunky hash browns While the food was not particularly impressive a little salty for my taste the sandwich could ve used some kind of condiment it was serviceable and for the portion size and the price 6 all I can say is DAMN a restaurant in Boston that actually understand what its food is worth Service was a little inattentive but they were pretty packed If I get the chance I m definitely coming back The other sandwiches looked so good and the salads etc were of a totally reasonable size for 7 9 gah this makes me so happy oh Table setup is kind of annoying I don t care for communal tables Anyway you can sit at the bar or one of the three communal tables or the back wall is lined w individual tables and there s an outside patio that has great people watching 
1_fticnd_3fjqs2oh9MFCQ CMU If I was writing this review solely about the beer or while drinking one of their beers the review would have more stars But unfortunately for the CBC the food sets the tone of this review Specifically a certain salad I went here back in October for lunch with a few people Being as girly stupid neurotic as possible I ordered a salad I don t know what it was called but it was one of those leafy blue cheese nuts apple crasin popular type of things Normally I totally dig this and its really hard to mess up But this sucked It sucked AND I was 3 pints deep THAT right there says something It s really my own fault for ordering a salad at a beer burger greasy food type of place But really How did you mess that up It lacked flavor and barely had anything but greens I was really sad and the beer only intensified my emotions Can you say BEER TEARS The three stars are for the beer We had some sort of pumpkin beer and it was really good I bet this is a fun place when your not eating salad but unfortunately I was I will most likely not return So many brew houses so little time 
20jWSeuM2TsNyj_5sXBj8g CMU This place is OK they used to have 1 2 price on all appetizers on Mondays but they reduced the menu you can choose from They also have this really corny trivia night that is fine if you are into that stuff Nachos are great here though 
20kcpzSazzoONd0m6bvsXw CMU My favorite things about Miracle are in no particular order periodic table menu whatever they place on the grilled chicken home fries red smooth ketchup goo triangular shape chemistry tables 1 lonely 13 TV lot s o lot s o window panes the fact that they open at around 7am for coffee the proprietors are marketing genii irony squared Go there and please remember to tip like a champ the burgers are very good but I do not believe them to be the best just sayin update the 13 tv has been replaced by a now standard flat screen tv I am indifferent also the bartender named Pencil is always very nice to us Especially when we accidentally drink too much and demand he play R B hip hop songs that nobody else likes He is so nice to us that for one minute I almost thought we should give him a Christmas Gift almost latest update I have been there for brunch many a time but this time I realized that this is one of my favorite brunch menu s around The font rules the portions are smaller as to not ruin your day and the choices are exactly what you require for b r u to the n c h 
22pp7bPD834a5GSfVeN6Hg CMU Good prices on mediocre Puerto Rican food It s convenient enough for a cheap lunch and might be pretty interesting to an adventurous eater who hasn t yet had PR food but that s about all it has going for it When I think of this type of food I expect succulent meats well seasoned rice beans hot crispy tostones All too often what I get is dry tostones bland beans watery rice and meat with so much fat and gristle that I can t even chew it And sometimes the food is cold to boot Yeah it s cute and the people are moderately friendly moreso if you speak Spanish but that just balances out the dirty silverware Bottom line I love the idea of it but hate the execution of it but when the wife wants octopus salad there s nowhere else to go 
249lu_P1ah_6_d-hgCEnCg CMU The moment we walked in we knew we picked the right place It was our first night in town and the first meal The waitress was from our home stat of pa and my favorite beer from our home town Victory Hop Devil was on tap I left my safety out the door and got the Ronnie jalapeno burger Huge kick but the beer cooled it off yum yum they also had skewers and hummus simple menu good beers great time 
24WanE_jQsrJ1ELRq2WjYA CMU Charlies Kitchen seems to like 2 s alot First I want to say this is probably the first time I ever was in a place that had an all male waitstaff at least when I went there There was a female bartender but I don t count her I m counting the people serving tables That being said I really couldn t find much fault with it We went and it was pretty busy overall but there was a booth near the back First which is always a positive for me coke products Coke is superior to pepsi and will greet our Coke overlords when they take over the world Then the two s began We got the Appitizer platter which had 2 of everything two jalapeno poppers two cheese sticks two chicken tenders two buffalo wings While they were tasty I do think a combo platter would have a LITTLE more The two s continued with one of the entrees I got the jalapeno burger with Waffle Fries This was an awesome burger in the sense that it actually had more then 3 slices of jalapeno on it Other Jalapeno burgers I ve gotten basically have had no jalapeno This was able to get a good kick and the waffle fries were nice and crispy My girlfriend got the Grilled Seafood Combo which came with Salmon 2 shrimp and 2 scallops The Cole slaw she said was fine but she wouldn t give it to me trying to talk me into liking Cole Slaw The rest of the food according to her was very tasty which is a good thing The staff was an excellent staff even though it was busy everyone was polite and friendly and they even have a Text your Server option which is awesome cause the place seems to get really busy It is a loud place but not loud enough that you can t hear the person you are talking to and a bit dark Still overall it is a great place and I will go again to try other items 
24ZHv7i6gm76ZqUBXrd2-w CMU This place is big Really big They were very accommodating for our group of 12 when we came here in the middle of a bar crawl to get some grub And the waiter was really nice and made sure we had full drinks and got everything together just fine Oh and the price is right here for dinner everything is reasonable but mainly because it s not that exceptional Yeah everything here was just ok when you really think about it Boring menu choices almost NO vegetarian choices I think I got some falafel dish that was dry and flavorless Kind of a random crowd of families students and old folks With the breadth and depth of places in Cambridge and brewpubs in both Cambridge and Boston there s really no reason to come back here for me I did appreciate the service and ease of making a group reservation though 
24ZVS-FY3T_VkcKk1qcMvg CMU Come on guys this place isn t so bad The pizza crusts contain spent grain from the brewing process Although a bit gimmicky it s a fun little touch and it actually tastes good This place also has ultra trendy items of the moment such as three varieties of baked mac n cheese and fried chicken with waffles I ve found the food to be reliably at least OK and sometimes even better than average Not bad because I normally hate pub food It makes me sad that some people dislike their beer so much Jason J The sampler is a fun way to try small helpings of five different types of beer Maybe my tastes are unrefined but I really enjoyed the pilsner with a nice buttery taste the pale ale on the sweeter side for a pale ale with floral instead of bitter hops and especially the Bad News Brown ale full of hoppy caramelly deliciousness on a visit last week I wasn t so fond of the Irish red ale and the Black Watch stout but this might just be because I don t like nitro It seemed to give these two beers a weird undertone and it might just have been that they were served a bit on the warm side If you re looking for dinner in Harvard Square and you don t want someplace fancy and expensive Rialto Henrietta s Table Upstairs on the Square or someplace casual and ultra cheap Clover Boloco Otto s or someplace that sucks Om Harvest then John Harvard s Brew House will do you just fine 
25dRj0CuLBo4OMRB56BJNg CMU I m all about the dives and this is definitely one of the better ones in the area I ve been in here after work button down and tie and not felt judgemental eyes glaring down on me Okay maybe I was concentrating too hard on my very reasonably priced drinks The food is decent in that bar comfort food sort of way Nothing special but I ve always been happier after the noshing I ve never managed to see a show here but I can imagine that it hops Overall the place just screams hangout What more could you want 
25RiqNn8wxwrqt3amcg6jA CMU Solid beer solid food solid service I don t like every beer at John Harvard s but most of them are a pleasure to drink and the ones that aren t seem to be a taste issue rather than a quality one I enjoy starting off with a beer sampler and then having a pint of my favorite If you order a sampler at a table they bring it in a neat paddle shaped rack that is space efficient At the bar we got the traditional long wooden racks The bartenders and servers seem knowledgeable about the beer and have been able to make good recommendations when we ve asked We used to get appetizers here all the time when I was in college over 10 years ago now and I remembered the food being pretty good Recently we came for dinner and it turns out my memory was correct Our buffalo wings were excellent meaty crispy and well sauced I had a chicken caesar salad and my husband had a pulled pork sandwich with fries The chicken caesar was pretty standard neither the best nor the worst I ve ever had My only complaint about it is that I think my shaved parmesan came from the end of the wedge since it was waxy and not very flavorful I enjoyed the fries I sampled too After peeping what other diners were ordering I m looking forward to having a burger here soon I particularly remember liking the quesadilla here in college and will order that at some point Service here is usually good but I want to call out our waiter Subhash for exceptionally good service when we ate dinner here He struck that perfect balance between being attentive and overly present We never wanted for a thing Despite all the good things I have to say about John Harvard s they re still a 4 star for me for now Everything here is good without very much being excellent They ll never let you down but they ll also rarely excite you We also had a disappointing experience here when we came with a large group maybe 12 people including a friend from England Our friend is in his early 30s and the people in our group ranged in age from 25 32 so no one borderline for drinking age John Harvard s would not accept our friend s international ID as proof of age and required a passport which he did not have on his person at the time I want to say that I do understand and appreciate that JH s needs to protect itself from serving under aged drinkers and in a conceptual sense I guess I m glad they have strict rules in place It just felt a little ridiculous to have our 30 something friend with his beard and his hologrammed state sealed English drivers license denied a beer We ended up skipping John Harvard s that day I m not lowering my rating because of this experience as I said I do understand why they have these rules but I wanted to mention it in the hopes that other international visitors will bring their passports 
28aOMwNRWzhSebS8opuMxQ CMU I don t see the miracle here I was really excited to try out Miracle after all I read on yelp and from friends but in the end I was left disappointed The burger I ordered was nothing more than average although it was kinda fun to order off of a periodic table since I can master food but not chemistry The beer was good but it s kinda hard to mess that up The service was decent she got the job done The atmosphere was kind of loud and it was really crowded I felt like I had to crawl over people just to get into my chair or head to the bathroom which is dangerous for a person like me who would rather risk kidney failure than bump into a stranger with a full bladder I m like an old leaky lady Three stars for a good bar and decent food I d go again with good company but I can say that for a lot of places 
29UsqsOUuGtoajoNaJM_BQ CMU Given that my current state very hungover has not little to do with John Harvard s I figure I should write them a review and say thanks We found ourselves in this dark basement pub for the seventieth time this year and whilst I was complaining about being stuck in the dungeon an incredible thing began to happen I started to enjoy myself without even realizing it We ve been here a bunch of times and I usually do have a great time but I m always troubled by the lack of natural light Last night s outing was no different But then my chicken sandwich came with those great fries It wasn t anything special nothing to rave about but it was good decent bar food Which is really in the end pretty spectacular right The beer came too two pitchers of it hence my yelping instead of working which requires standing bleh The waitress recommended the Demon D PA instead of IPA they get cute with their beer names which sometimes isn t so successful The softest bullet ever shot for instance is too long and indicative of a suppository This waitress along with many of the bar tenders and other staff was great Here s why 1 she got pissed at the swarm of Harvard students who inundated our communal high top and asked us to move 2 she resembled one of my favorite authors 3 she overheard me asking the bar tender for a spoon He didn t have any but when I returned to my table she magically appeared with one never had to ask her And now for the best part It was trivia night And we didn t even know it when we walked in So after sitting for a couple of hours eating drinking moving to another table drinking more we decided to order another pitcher and stay for the entertainment Trivia night happens a lot places I know and this wasn t any better than any other actually it was worse because I guess you have to be smaht to go to that college there or something But here s the thing the moral of this whole story the reason John Harvard s wins me over despite it s mediocrity and darkness It s just a nice place to be I m comfortable here What could be better than that That suppository thing was stolen from Rob P He said it first Oh and please don t condemn me for the rambling probably incomprehensible nature of this little spout it comes from having too much fun last night 
2a2AUtrrKbYr8qK_WWk6vg CMU Come for the beer Stay for the beer The pizza was good and the fritter rocked But that beer selection whoa I ll compare this place to the band the Clash Sophisticated beer drinking music for a sophisticated beer drinking bar 
2a6aIveMZjdcsJ-yCaoHsA CMU Just stopped here for a beer as I ve run into them at local beer festivals but never really spent time in the area I had a collaboration between CBC Victory and Stone and it was delicious For a second round we had dry hopped porter served off the cask which was outstanding I will definitely be heading back 
2Agueh3zVn5QABdEFYcZmg CMU Never had a meal here that I actually enjoyed in fact I ve only had meals that I had no interest in finishing because they were so bland and uninteresting but it is one of the few places in Cambridge I know of with outdoor seating so I end up returning for that reason alone I am actively seeking alternatives 
2AHRpNcs_v004AGOvU_8-A CMU Everything on their menu is soooooo heavy Yuck Also it s always super crowded which is annoying The outside beer garden is nice but you can t find a seat And the upstairs is too dark I do like the crowd here though nice and sketchy 
2AuFV_d5FDC3u6MFLGlGYg CMU Reese Witherspoon managed to charm her way into Harvard s Law School in Legally Blonde but for most of us living in the real world coming to the COOP is about as close to getting into the university as we ll ever be Very light noshing among very heavy intellectuals discussing topics far more erudite than Reese Witherspoon movies believe me 
2bkvrHmhKHPpeu-rFAf0ZQ CMU One of the best bars in Cambridge in my book Great beers on tap health and delicious food totally laid back atmosphere Only problem is that it s often cold especially when the garage door window is open and especially near the door 
2Ci_C0RGRqZAgjCJJ1xblw CMU This place is good but not so good that it is great Basically if you want a burger and a beer you ll get it The atmosphere isn t bad but the best part of the place is the stainglass window outside of Jerry Garcia holding a copy of the Electric Coolaid Acid Test 
2E1bK7xbko3Up1Yr-sux9w CMU Very original theme and the skewers are pretty good However the service was blunt borderline rude Most disappointingly they refused to serve us after our tab got pretty huge 
2f0ICUG5ggzvdjwAFAXqIw CMU Lord Hobo I love you When I step out of my front door I can see you This was no accident It was definitely a factor in choosing our apartment Beer Selection Great selection of local and imports and the bartenders know their stuff Food I love the chicken lollipops and polenta fries Both very well executed and creative I ve had the scallop and quinoa a couple of times also very good The food can skew a bit on the heavy side but its a gastro pub so I suppose thats to be expected Decor They have revolving displays of local artists with many of the pieces for sale The overall decor of the place is nice and it accommodates large groups well It gets busy and loud on the weekends its a bar so if thats not your thing keep that in mind The staff is cool knowledgeable and helpful now if we could just get the bill that legalizes happy hour passed 
2FnDKBtkRx06Xk8Ntyrsfg CMU Simply awesome beers Friendly servers First brewery restaurant in the Boston area opened the year I turned 21 like we were meant to be together Go you won t regret Avoid weekend nights if you don t like standing 
2gCjqnyjtRL53SIOVDGunQ CMU Food was HORRIBLE Both my wife and I got ill after and I am not kidding The Calamari was soggy my medium rare steak was purple and we could not leave fast enough The service is fine but the set up is weird If you feel like paying a lot for plain food that is gross than this is the place for you 
2hbPhdxY0nM0XwgoCJssKQ CMU I recently hosted a networking event at Meadhall The event brought together around 60 70 locals to get together enjoy some beer and get to know each other Meadhall provided us free of charge the upstairs mezzanine space for our event Meadhall also generously provided two gift cards as door prizes The upstairs mezzanine is large with enough space for 100 or more Our group was very comfortable There are couches and comfortable chairs upstairs a dining room space and lots of bar stools along the railing overlooking the downstairs space The bar in the mezzanine space only has a few taps less than 10 but that was not an issue Our guests were allowed to order anything off of the menu and our waitstaff would retrieve drinks from downstairs if needed The beer selection is significant If anything I was paralyzed by the amount of choices For our event we had a bartender and two wait staff assigned Service was very quick and the staff was pleasant I heard no complaints from our guests about the quality of service received I did not have food on this visit and cannot speak to that aspect Overall we had a great event at Meadhall and I hope we can return for another event in the future 
2hcltecmMih_KLFrBOge5w CMU This place treated my visiting family to really top notch breakfast brunch experiences during a long term stay here It s your typical hotel buffet in many ways with an omelette station various pastries bagels granola and fresh fruit Where they went overboard was the way they treated the kids who got their meals at an enormous discount 3 for the six year old and 5 for the 8 year old and 11 year old The kids also got a little sheet of stickers and crayons with their place mat and those kept them busy for a full ten minutes Our waitresses were sweet and never charged me for my morning bagel So the whole meal was a great bargain The kids ate up a storm and when they did not want their fresh pineapple raspberries or blackberries we did not let them go to waste The kids ate French toast pancakes bagels cereal bacon and sausage muffins and more All of that food kept them going throughout a full day of touring the city with only a few snacks and some juice The fruit was not of the watery tin canned variety It was really fresh and seriously good This restaurant is no longer open for dinner but this breakfast experience gets a big gold star in my book 
2IvSX4Kh2g8YBDOQQZuLXg CMU Admittedly the mister and I were pretty psyched up about Lord Hobo He s a big beer guy so we had high hopes We d been patiently waiting for it to open and yesterday was the day So we trekked on over to Inman got to the door around 5 30 and were actually able to get seats at a shared table The menu was really limited with regard to vegetarian offerings and we were shocked at how high the prices were We chose to share the deviled eggs the truffle fries and the wild mushroom polenta with grilled vegetables He started with a De Ranke beer and I stuck with water The beer arrived without a head and he was annoyed that it was somewhat flat and lackluster a big letdown considering it cost 10 Within 5 minutes of ordering our food the dishes all arrived at our table There were 6 deviled egg halves and they were pretty good worth the 5 that they cost But then it all kind of went downhill from there The fries tasted pretty good but they were too small and difficult to dip into the sauces And the sauces were served in these tiny little bowls that were really annoying for dipping For 9 I expected better And the polenta It cost 18 I probably spend that much on an entree once or twice a year and it s usually at a special dinner This dish was not worth 18 It was a pile of polenta and it had some squash and carrots and other vegetables on top It was nothing to write home about maybe I would have been satisfied with it had it cost 12 but 18 No way Jose He got one other beer which he was happier with both for the better quality and the better price but it wasn t enough to make up for the overall mediocre experience It seems that Lord Hobo suffers from a bit of an identity crisis It s a bar In the menu there is one page of their food offerings while all of the other pages showcase their various drinks I have no problem with bars But when I go to bars I want to eat bar food not yuppie interpretations of bar food that cost me a ton of money We ended up dropping nearly 65 on two beers deviled eggs fries and polenta Two hours later the mister was so hungry that he insisted we stop at Panera so he could get a sandwich I think that is pretty unacceptable So overall Lord Hobo was a bust for us I hope that over time they will work out the kinks and offer different types of food and more vegetarian items at a more reasonable price But in the meantime we ll stick with the Publick House where we know we can always get good food and good beer and not drop a crazy amount of money 
2jks8vmlRmnViX0NHh12Xg CMU If you re looking for a casual night out with friends this is a great Harvard establishment to frequent I come here for comfort food and appreciate the graduate student environment that is often found I m giving it a 4 star because it s one of my favorite hang out spots in Cambridge 
2KCFnPCDMILSU-aCVmG-GQ CMU How did I never write a review for Charlie s My safe haven when I first moved here maybe the only reason I stayed okay that s a lie The only valid reason for hating this place is that you are a hater and that s that Not because it s dirty as hell or that sometimes the staff is real bitchy or that they charge a lot for those 99 cents shaw s backyard bbq possibly real beef patties or that annoying cow bell that rings when food is ready from the kitchen or that you get backlash when you sit in the booths from the other booths or those obnoxious kids who make dinosaur and sea animal noises when cheering while watching a football game ahem it s because you are a HATER All I would like to emphasize along with these hundred something reviews is WAFFLE FRIES 
2KLeyGRX4GPmPUF8Vv49ow CMU I had been wanting to try Harvest for a while but didn t think of it last night until OpenTable had a last minute spot for two there We waited 20 minutes between our first and second courses and my friend s burger was crazy overdone Then it took too long for them to redo it so we left with him hungry It was the kitchen s fault the waiter and the manager profusely apologized and didn t ask us to pay for dinner plus gave us coffee dessert I appreciated that I docked them an extra star for a lack of vegetarian options although I did like my gnocchi Also the calamari was really delicious Bottom line I will definitely go back again but only with omnivore or at least fish eating friends 
2l0T4Jtwrv3QtrNdESLfQw CMU Tough not to love Charlie s even if it isn t spectacular food It s a good bar a good late night hangout and a good hangout just in general Food isn t incredible but it s very decent and it s a very versatile place that s really fun and loud 
2l39FpNQnMKAj7H6GMLFVg CMU I used to love this place they have a great drink selection the food is amazing those burgers are to die for and the service is great especially Catie and it s so close to home I was even thinking of making it my neighborhood bar Unfortunately they have taken the chairs away from the upper bar area which is my favorite place to sit I have to stand up at work all day and would prefer not to have to do so when I m out having fun and relaxing Bring back those chairs 
2LlRG6Bh9TVNk2Tj3BxDGA CMU Decent late night food joint with tons and tons of hamburger cheeseburger any type of burgers For vegetarians their veggie wrap is pretty decent loaded with tons of veggies hummus and pepper jack cheese in a whole wheat wrap I got the fried green beans as a side which I really wasn t impressed with While they tasted OK there was no identifiable taste of GREEN BEAN inside the fried casing I ended up picking the green bean out of the fried shell and eating them by themselves ew Their BBQ sauce was really terrible Charlie s Kitchen meh I wouldn t go back 
2LquDroEcf6jtvmVpPj-Hg CMU Beers and shots for 4 5 and awesome waffle fries I will be coming here more often And I know at least one waitress who was friendly and attentive to our big group we loved her There is only one unisex restroom downstairs more upstairs so get in line early Their kitchen is open pretty late compared to other places which I appreciate very much 
2lRGGgWySGGkEeD4xeRJwQ CMU Meadhall was a top notch Gastropub experience Having over 100 awesome and sometimes hard to find beers on tap is not something you can get around here very easily and the bar layout is fun and impressive To those who complain about some beers being out of tap they have over 100 beers on tap in smaller kegs so that freshness of beer is not an issue This means they ll run out of few things sure But what place doesn t And with the large selection you can always find something equally as intriguing The food we had was great shared 4 appetizers fries house made pork rinds pickled vegetables and steak tartare All were excellent and not outrageously priced Looking over the dinner menu some items were certainly pricier than the bar menu but considering the quality of ingredients and presentation from what came out prices seemed appropriate And really if you re spending 12 on a ultra rare craft beer is 22 for a high quality artisanal meal that off target If you like and excellent variety of excellent beer as well as a fun and innovative high quality accompanying menu come check Meadhall out Don t let others negative reviews scare you away I almost did and would have missed out on one of the best new restaurants in the Metro Boston area 
2MaWEXbvQ-0qq1Ss2fr0Bw CMU Please do lifelong Cantabridgians a favor and stay out if you are not one of our number This is not one of your chucklehead spots and should not be treated as such We may grant you an easement if you have resided here for ten years or more in a non degree granting program of life 
2ne2GaQke8ZQTCBMFzYV1A CMU Comfortable upscale restaurant in Harvard Sq Nice bar warm atmosphere very good american food Good wine list Food Rating 4 5 Stars Service Rating 4 5 Stars Decor Rating 4 5 Stars 
2NhY5biW2Vvj7MR_ewmRlA CMU one very intelligent establishment 
2NxdV6lNcioIo_6_xltWiw CMU I had a well seasoned perfectly textured veggie burger and some of their house fries They re more like wedges really Yum Despite being busy I got plenty of water refills which always scores points in my book 
2PsYolpL0zdvCeirQhm4yw CMU Very reasonable prices and a great bread basket The steak tips and shrimp is an especially good choice Otherwise pretty standard American fare nothing to write home about 
2QZxdlYMimP7SywtoSzBZw CMU It looks like Cambridge 1 but with metal tables The service is friendly yet indifferent like Cambridge 1 The crowd isn t as old as Cambridge 1 The food comes out in like five minutes like Cambridge 1 The flatbread crust is not as tasty as the pizza crust at Cambridge 1 The bathrooms are unisex like Cambridge 1 Look out for the one on the left the toilet doesn t flush well Tory Row Cambridge 1 as A F Ruehl Gap Banana Republic American Eagle Martin Osa 
2R1cKuviDI98Qvzp8I5SnQ CMU I want to like this place more I love the artful design of the logo and will probably buy a pint glass or two the next time I go The beer is decent and definitely has potential Our waitress was nice and tried to be helpful It s just not the first place that I would offer up to a friend or family member if they were cruising around Cambridge for a day and wanted to know of some good places to eat That being said the food is decent We tried the crab cakes also good but were a tad too expensive for the two that showed up on the plate The burgers were messier than I would have expected for their cost the bottom bun already soaked in the meat juices before it had hit our table I also thought that waters all around would ve been a given but perhaps I just should ve spoken up about it All in all not a bad place but not something I d write home about 
2rCeKvASAQIj6v3OwaRi7w CMU I m not sure how and I doubt it s anything healthful but ABP has figured out how to make some tasty hot sandwiches I often stop by the Cambridge location after taking the red eye into Boston for H Y Would be but minus one star since Lou Dobbs was sitting next to us last time and we could smell his xenophobia oozing over to our table 
2SzlpWd2pbbUtkSPcZS5Cw CMU I came here for lunch today with a co worker of mine We shared a hummus plate and I got a chicken skewer she got a chicken and shrimp skewer The hummus plate was delicious The pita bread was fresh and warm and it came with a few slices of tomato and cucumber My chicken skewer was pretty good as well Came with this tortilla wrap and peanut satay sauce The sauce was like a salty clump of peanut butter My co worker s chicken and shrimp skewers looked fabulous Hers came on a bigger plate with all sorts of goodies The table next to us were eating burgers that looked fabulous as well Overall it was OK Nothing really special The periodic table menu was pretty novel I will have to come back here for drinks sometime 
2tNwouPUnrtEAak_GOnAcQ CMU Food quality seems to vary quite a bit from day to day month to month year to year I ve been there and have absolutely love the meal and on other days its looked and tasted like something from a microwave could even be the same dish I loved on a prior visit Not sure what s going on in the kitchen The beer is a bit more predictable and always good to very good In the last few years they ve gotten a bit more creative with the brews they offer which means there is usually something different to try on every visit Outdoor seating is great in the summer as the square comes to life during lunchtime though get here early for lunch if you want to be outdoors and in the shade 
2va9bVIdDLKqYcziXeDwsg CMU With 400 reviews not sure mine matters but in brief kinda cool place Good beer selection MAD cute barntender the Friday night I went and the food was solid I had the chicken infused grilled cheese a little soggy but whatever guests had a burger and chick parm sand no complaints from either BUT you MUST have the beer battered fries To me fries are like suburban chinese food they are mostly just blah but these fries are worth searching out The standard and waffle fries not much to write home about 
2Vc9X5-SYs130eVzgpzPMQ CMU i don t know why i keep forgetting about shay s i really shouldn t there s this really awesome waitress there named amy she s super friendly and remembers everyone s name food is standard bar fare but i love the outdoor seating and drinks are reasonably priced no more forgetting 
2WMJxbZ9Wg2XFdBMgBhcbA CMU Oh Charlie As far as dive bars are concerned this one is top notch If you want something classy or you are not on a budget then don t come here Yes there is no waitress here Find a seat and plant your ass The double cheese burgers are stellar when soaking up your beer And their draft selections are just fantastic and cover all sorts of bases From your fruity beer lovers to your hop heads someone is bound to find a brew they like here The juke box deserves its own Yelp review and it just might be one of the best juke boxes in town A tasty way to get a little tipsy for under 15 bucks 
2wmprd52gwoWbl8xhZ4fNw CMU Restaurant week for lunch gotta love it I had the boullibase which was melt in your mouth seafood at it s best My coworkers had the lamb meatloaf never imagined meatloaf as good as this The soup fennel and apple might have sounded strange but was unreal or wicked good Then just when you thought you couldn t be happier cappuccino creme Carmel OFF THE CHAIN Will go back again and again and again 
2wxeEEFM3QB1aanC_uAAJw CMU Cambridge Brewing Company is in the Kendall Square Complex The inside is nice You can see all of the brewing equipment and they have booths in the back as well The servers are friendly and very knowledgable on the beers that they serve The food is reasonably priced and tasty I recommend the burger and the pulled pork sandwich The beers are fantastic They have 4 house beers and rotating taps of sesonal brews The Darkest Night and Charles River Porter are both awesome I will easily come back again Great place 
2xEowVnREjPsGPZ-YFtbLw CMU Ok so I was brought here by a bunch of yelpers who raved about it And I agree It was pretty awesome when we wanted PBRs and to be left alone in a corner Being a waitress and restaurant manager myself I would like to say that I admit I am critical The service was horrendous We were very much ignored waved our waitress down and she never smiled once I guess the atmosphere was very glasses long hair no cares snooty harvard stuff but comon The Waffle Fries were delightful the Mozz sticks yes mozz sticks exactly what I called for nothing bad nothing amazing We were an obnoxious crowd of cheap beer drinking people in the middle fo teh afternoon but personally I would take this as an opportunity to make bank on tips Hint large crowds of drunk people will tip you lots if you hang out with them make fun of them or are just a generally awesome waitress TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY GUYS So If you want this experience which I admit you do every now and then head on down its great dark you ll forget what time it is and have an awesome time but dont expect to be smiled at liked or treated well 
2xqIqOXK710t26vBwVDJxQ CMU After reading all the awesome reviews on yelp I decided to go check out Izzy s for myself Based on the recommendations I ordered the pork chops with sweet plantains and the tripe soup The bf got the roasted pork with rice and beans and the beef turnover Everything was a little on the greasy size but quite good The tripe soup had a LOT of tripe in it and was a little sour for my taste but not bad I will probably try some of the other soups instead next time The pork chops and roast pork was a little dry but decent I think I will probably go for fish next time I was very impressed with the amount of sweet plantains that came with my pork chop which tasted fantastic Beef turnover was greasy but good like everything else And amazingly all that food we ordered was only about 20 I will definitely return here from time to time but like Annie P said it s not some place you can go back to all the time and be satisfied 
2xxq4WK12UOI3HZmiyKIKg CMU Went hear Saturday night and had a pretty miserable experience Was just trying to have a good time with my buddies and bartender was incredibly rude Would not recommend this place neither for drinks nor dinner If you re looking to have a nice beer with friends pick somewhere else 
2ZEXNmTAe0wiF47Q-0NnQg CMU I havent been here in a few years but this was a nice hang out place to go It looked like a pub located in cambridge clean beer flowing and good food Now that i enjoy beer i would love to go back and drink 5 glasses of all of the ones the serve its just a nice hang out place 
2ZuRZE7r9fY-nTszdl_Vmg CMU This week we decided to explore one of our favorite watering holes across the river in Cambridge the Cambridge Brewing Company Public transit in Boston doesn t exactly make it easy to get to this gem from my home in Brighton so we aren t exactly regulars there but we are familiar enough and the journey was worth it In summation with their beer menu split between the simple and the sublime and some interesting beer alternatives like wild fermented wines as well as a respectable food menu and very sociable open atmosphere CBC is a great option for diverse groups in the Kendall Central square areas of Cambridge I d go so far as to say it s the best option for excellent beer in Cambridge Somerville if not for the fact that I crave variety more than anything and CBC only serves it s own beer It does sit shoulder to shoulder with Bukowski s for this honor however For the Full Review http trappistpunks blogspot com 2009 07 beer run cambridge brewing company html 
328EZAQs08NJk6X4pgcFBw CMU The jalapeno stuffed burger here was AMAZING The service was good and the atmosphere was laid back and cozy Definitely going back 
32t0Y3jsQ8PZtgpLHKq1GQ CMU Love the outdoor seating 
35iTMpxx8K8_B_MlgFmipw CMU I can t believe that I ve never reviewed the Cambridge Brewing Company considering that I m absolutely IN LOVE with their pumpkin beer Every fall I trek all the way to Cambridge just to pick up a growler Sometimes I even stop in for some food On my most recent visit we ordered the calamari the buffalo tenders and the cheese board The calamari was quite tasty but it was served with this weird lime sauce I hope they get rid of that and bring back something similar to a marinara it will make the dish so much better The buffalo tenders were smaller than I ve seen before but they were great and pretty spicy It was so nice to be able to pop one of those suckers into your mouth without having to worry about cutting it into a million tiny pieces The cheese board is where it s at We tried some sort of brie and some sort of gouda and it was our favorite plate Do I stop in here all the time No but I know that I m in for some good food and delicious pumpkin beer when I do CBC If I don t see you again this fall winter I ll see you again next year For sure 
36pzmbO5wUiJprlpPUzwLQ CMU I am rating this place on the beer and things related to the beer The atmosphere seemed typical for a brewpub and based on what others tell me and the review say the food seems typical so I might as well comment on what is not typical This place changes its beers all the time which is good but it doesn t provide accurate information on their beers on their website THIS IS FRIGGIN LAME Also I have called and written to various people in the company asking for information on their beers and they never get back to me In particular I want to enter their beers onto ratebeer com and I cannot because they don t provide me with this info AAAH Makes me want to scream Piss ant of a brewery The quality of the beer It s above average for a microbrewery I ve tried I think 7 of their brews and all were good But the variability from one brew to the next is minimal there s something about these beers that tastes more or less the same They all have a sort of coarse grainy texture to them a sort of mild but complex sourness a certain quality that is hard to describe None of them were bad but none of them were outstanding either I would drink them again except that I am currently boycotting this miserable establishment because of their lack of information on the beers What good is it to drink a beer if I cannot rate it on ratebeer com Piss ants I m never going back 
3AScroOiv3AioJF6lAfNUA CMU Sara H sums it up better than I can or will Clearly it is an Au Bon Pain and I never go to another one but this one my fiance go to most weeks after Mass Oddly there is a good atmosphere Old folks going there as a regular thing a few troubled people enjoying a non judgemental atmosphere a few scholars and a rather snooty Brit when I am there Somehow it is rather nice 
3aSNsGSvyxNonRRnerREUg CMU The Miracle of Science is a very unique place They have a great full bar and their menu is something like I ve never seen it is written in a chemistry table of elements Very original and I digg that really Their food is pretty good and the prices are good as well Their coffee is very good and so is their selection of breakfast foods Their staff is also very nice and they serve quickly The atmosphere there is very laid back and that s also another cool thing although the size of the place makes it very difficult to get a table sometimes and it does tend to also get pretty loud in there when its packed They are clean though very clean Great place Go check it out for yourself 
3azgehTaLkJVmX_GIENu8g CMU While the food was pretty good it took us nearly an hour to get a table The wait staff has no clue what s going on and can t even keep a simple list of who got there first The people waiting for a table basically have to jockey for position or organize themselves to get the next available table but sometimes you can be waiting for 30 minutes and when your back is turned someone will walk right in and grab a seat The bartender sucked knew nothing about the beer selection and was extremely unpleasant So bottom line Waitstaff sucks balls food is OK Probably not worth your time 
3BmUt-60WytySUvFqMEpmg CMU I went in here and it was too loud Yeah I m old fat and relatively disgusting but at the same time who is your clientele It was super loud in here and my beer although delicious was not up tp par with a beverage I might get across the street at Starbucks I want AWESOME I want WOW What I got was DELICIOUS tater tots and a desire to look into things further In this bar expect things to be busy and loud Expect the server to be busy and the menu to provide delicious bar classics Delicious in case you missed that part Cheese beer bacon akfjhkhfashf yeah Expect the servers to want to understand your requirements and be awesome You can go to any bar in Cambridge But you will endure sub par experiences anywhere else 
3dNGx7wEXcIF0_hQwdkPrQ CMU Hot cider in the winter is highly recommended Mmm warm drunky fun 
3duMouoSD6klslZ4mz7JEg CMU I think I ve said it before but I will say it again any place with good beer deserves my attention CBC s beer is fresh and the prices are reasonable The food is a little pricey but always delicious try the potstickers The beerunch is decent too I had a Black Velvet there porter and champagne think it s gross It s actually not Watch out for crowding It can get PACKED 
3FGU9pRVEYQOTya41YDlUA CMU John Harvard s is synonymous in my mind with one thing buffalo chicken mac n cheese Think spicy chunks of juicy chicken and bleu cheese mixed in with creamy cheesy bread crumby pasta goodness My roommate and I have been coming here on monthly dates because we just can t get enough Beer selection is plentiful and I ve never tried any of their homebrews that I didn t like Recent samples have included the Raspberry Porter heavy but delicious almost like a dessert beer and the Holiday Red only available during the Christmas season Best of all if you become completely obsessed with any of their seasonal beers you can purchase jugs of the brew to take home Not a bad way to shake things up from your normal Sam Adams six pack The only reason Johnny isn t getting five stars Service at JH is a mixed bag Many of the servers I ve experienced here have been super friendly but others have been equally as blase or uncaring I just visited on Valentine s Day with a group of girlfriends and granted the place was mobbed but our silverware and waters were basically hurled at us and it took more than a half hour to place our order Boo 
3GMf-cA6YGUSZlDwMHkNsg CMU I came here for breakfast on a lazy Monday morning Looking for something cheap ish but also satisfying and delicious The egg hash browns with canadian bacon covered in delicious gruyere cheese with bottomless coffee really hit the spot I really wasn t expecting the deliciousness of the breakfast for a mere 5 but Tory Row is full of surprises I ll have to come back at some point to sample the rest of the great sounding and surprisingly cheap breakfasts The waitress was a little slow especially given that the place was practically deserted the coffee cup was tiny and I needed refills She only gave me a couple of creamers and it took so long to get the coffee I decided it wasn t worth it to wait around for the creamers she didn t think to get more of p Other than that it s a perfect breakfast spot when you want to avoid work and read the paper over delicious food for half an hour 
3JcU0soNydzWEX8ZsvfWQQ CMU Decent beers and food but nothing special They have pretty good appetizers and burgers sandwiches The prices are reasonable and the service is generally pretty good but I HATE that this place is down in the basement It s so dark and unappealing I think there are definitely better restaurants pubs in the Harvard square area that you should try before this 
3kHZi_M6mn-7xxKV9zo5xw CMU I m with Erica S MOS is a fine bar and all and the food is decent but where is the science Black lab countertops are not enough and the periodic table menu is merely a step in the right direction This place needs to serve drinks in beakers 
3LAGqhbvFqUFXdkVUFsZ3w CMU Great for a cheap strong drink late night Lunch really is a deal too Lobster rolls at Charlie s never mind the double cheeseburgers if you re crazy hungry Upstairs is way more fun at night popular with the tattoo crowd 
3Mtfu5r2bUSbqOA6rf1DLQ CMU I love going to Chuck s for a beer they ve got a great selection Chimay on tap Karaoke is fun too Some of the waitstaff bartenders are great some are laughably ditzy but in many late night trips after getting off work I ve never experienced a mean one I love the atmosphere and the music and the place Ahh memories However there is no reason to come here for food unless you re blacked out and everywhere else is closed And someone stole your wallet And your tastebuds Nachos here American cheese on generic grocery store chips I have enjoyed a veggie burger or two but I was in one or more of the above categories at those times 
3M_7agD0yjb3XVCb0SIwqA CMU I had lunch at Harvest today it was restaurant week so it was a 3 course lunch for 22 12 For the appetizer I ordered the zucchini fritters they were very dry had no flavor except very salty and you would never know there was any zucchini except for some green specks throughout For the entree they ran out of one of the two options so I was offered a pasta with vegetables It was bland with old peas no flavor at all really bad The best part was a chocolate cake it was delicious I ve been here before and it was very good but today was very disappointing they need to do better for restaurant week if they want people to come back Before this I was sold on the place but it will be a long time before I go back there if ever 
3NXkyDnV0rVWpB_a7fTI1g CMU I ve been to Meadhall a few times and really liked the place There are 2 distinct sections that have a completely different look feel the upstairs is more like a laid back hangout place complete with couches and big screen TVs and the downstairs is much more like a nice restaurant I mostly tend to stick to downstairs and I ve always had a good experience Service was always prompt and very friendly both just getting drinks at the bar and when having a meal even on super busy nights Their beer selections of course is great I found a couple of my favorites on tap that no other bar in Boston had as for the food I found it to be way better than anything I ve ever tried in a beer place e g Publik House Sure the food is a little more expensive than what you d normally pay for at a bar but it s also much higher quality I tried their Arctic Char and Lamb entrees which were both great fine dining quality in both taste and presentation and the hummus appetizer was really tasty as well So yeah I am a fun Meadhall is really the kind of a place you d go to if you want to have a good beer AND a good meal Sounds like a winner to me 
3odHvgTaTHfgPAEbT2hM6Q CMU I don t get the big hype on the MIracle of Science really While the periodic table of their menu is a creative thought I would really rather that you provide me with a menu that I can hold Some people can t see the whole menu at certain angles Lucky for you I already came in here knowing I was planning on having the ronie get it Roni E burger anyway thanks to Tom E Holy Hell this is HOT Mind you I am one to normally be able to handle my spice but this burger was made with jalapenos topped with pepper jack cheese served with homefries and a pickle Although I enjoyed the burger I had to stop every so often to cool off my palate The homefries are sauteed with onions and a salsa type sauce which was definitely different for me but consumed with content none the less So the verdict the food was great The service not so much My biggest issue I guess with this place is that it s a free for all when trying to grab a table There s no order or a host that can control seating So people kind of just hover over tables waiting to see who will finish next and then dash for tables as soon as someone puts on their jacket So to the owners of Miracle of Science I fully expect the next time I come in that you ve made the following improvements 1 Hire a Host 2 Print out menus for customers who want to be able to hold something in their hands to read rather than trying to squint to read the board 
3ohnxtyS35ZpV9R9LSRa_g CMU I came here with my friend for some drinks When we arrived the bar was packed It took forever to get a drink and find a place to chill out Fortunately they have a full bar and the bartenders are friendly I ordered a Washington Apple It was stronger than I last remember so they don t skimp on the alcohol Also a little tip for the single ladies this is not a place to meet men if you are female At least that was the case the Friday night I was there 
3pfFo9d5lIJ8j380mqA0yg CMU Went here for food and a few more drinks after being at Phoenix Landing and it was a good choice Food is okay nothing fantastic but that burger was just what I needed at the time I expected more in the way of a science theme but I liked the atmosphere and decor none the less It was pretty crowded but not so loud that we couldn t carry on a conversation that included all 7 of us at the table could hear and participate it The menu took a few minutes to get adjusted to before I could actually look at it and figure out what I wanted and it s annoying that it s ONLY on the wall so if you re seated at that table around the corner like we were you have to stand up again to look at it Wait staff was very friendly and quick I d go back for drinks certainly but I think you can get a way better 8 burger somewhere else 
3S3O0FSCBYHD1612pmxCmg CMU Blech I ve been here on numerous occasions and haven t been impressed by the beer OR the food There s really no need to stop in here with so many other tempting food drink choices in the area 
3snrKIcv8HzhttO4EXfSaQ CMU Good line of beers though the glass sizes are a bit deceptive if you don t know what you re do So tip 1 Know what you re doing Tip 2 Eat a pizza They re big surprisingly delicious and people will envy you all night Tip 3 Observe Check out the walls and then check out the odd crowd See if you can match them up 
3uA9QbJ1RTATKr4pycwoPQ CMU I dunno Charlie s really seems like my kind of place divey burgers decent beer selection but for some reason it just doesn t do anything for me First time I came here got some food I believe it was the appetizer sampler and it was just ok I remember the service being pretty terrible though and only seeing our waitress maybe twice throughout our meal Also those hand held devices they use don t seem to make things much faster or easier I m not usually one to judge places for being dingy but I feel like Charlie s is kind of grimey It just looks old and dusty Also the upstairs is hard to find or maybe I m just an idiot The beer garden is nice when it s warm out because drinking outside when the weather s nice is always fun I bumped my review up from 2 stars to 3 just because of the beer garden The day I went they also had a deal on Sam Summer outside which was pretty cool Otherwise Charlie s isn t a place I d choose to go but I d return if my friends wanted to hang out there Maybe I need to try a burger in order to change my mind 
3UpEamz20nKiyEJb1Tqy8A CMU I ve been to this place a few times since it s opening a little over a month ago I have mixed reviews over this place so I ll go into detail here The atmosphere is definitely a 4 there s a ton of taps with a brass back splash making it a pretty sweet setup The bar downstairs is quite big with seating all around tables scattered throughout and plenty of room all around They carry so many different types of beer that makes it quite unique There is also a smaller area upstairs that has couches seats and a small bar I haven t been up there but it looks pretty nice Well done The service is going to get a 3 although I think this will change as time goes on While there is plenty of room at the bar I think the bartender to patron ratio is a little off It took a while to get the attention of someone for a refill and I noticed at one point that a tap was leaking I notified what apparently was the bar back about the issue 15 minutes later a bartender finally took a look at it and they figured out the problem I m not a math whiz but a leaking tap for 15 minutes sounds like a decent amount of cash down the drain I m giving the food a 3 as well you re trying too hard to be fancy here People go to gastropubs for the beer and comfort food I took one look at the menu saw some weird appetizers that looks anything but and opted for some french fries and I think a hummus or cheese plate We got a plate with nowhere near enough bread crostini so we asked for more It took over 20 minutes to get additional bread for this and then two different people got involved to bring this out Again I think this may change as they learn more about balancing the front of house with the kitchen All in all I think this place has huge potential Figure out the kitchen change the menu to more comfort food and hire additional staff and this place will be a gold mine 
3v8kpC9xF1tGJnRIe-Dm0A CMU Food was cold and nothing tasted very good Table service was so bad we had to go to the bar to buy drinks in the middle of dinner Beer list was good but they were out of half of what I wanted to try 
3vOzMcAcvAXgYzF15flmXw CMU I ve always heard good things about this place The place was a little hard to find but once inside the atmosphere was warm and inviting Since restaurant week was going on I opted for that menu My first course was a field greens walnut and gorgonzola salad This sounds simple but the combo worked well The walnuts were candied the dressing was perfect and the cheese was delivered in a large slice Fiance had the Harvest charcuterie A selection of meats and duck liver mousse Great presentation and variety Second courses I had Scottish salmon This involved a juicy cut of salmon perfectly seared accompanied by a curry sauce The plate was very colorful Fiance had the short ribs He said they tasted stew like Not bad but not as good as he hoped For dessert we split a panna cotta which was served over a thin brownie This had the perfect amount of creamy and crunchy The atmosphere was country chic Service was right on This is one of the nicest restaurants I ve been to in Harvard Square There is even a small patio overlooking the courtyard of the Charles Hotel 
3WqoJPT-mVp_WTTDOpMrCA CMU What is it that us Brits like so much about Shay s Does the pub style remind of me British pubs No not really it s too dark and small more of an Irish bar Is the beer and food selection very British No again not really just typical Boston pub stuff So what can it be Well I think it s two or three things Firstly as Rina says it s laid back and this is what we like in British pubs somewhere to go relax and spend the day without needing to make anything special out of it And secondly as many of the rest of the reviewers here point out it has the huge draw of outdoor seating and us Brits really miss being able to drink on the streets when we re here in the USA Nothing beats an afternoon relaxing with beers by the sidewalk and watching the world go by whilst you put the world to right with your conversation And the third draw It s just where Brits go so more will follow I noticed this one afternoon in November when it dawned upon me that along with my two visitors from London all the other strangers around us were also British Turned out one of these strangers had even got into a fight with my visitor when they were at school together An awkward but surprising coincidence indeed 
3xIeEGTLkfB7_oUAJL1BYA CMU A pretty solid bar Generally this was the place Friday night you can get the crew together to go grab some drinks and dance The DJs spin generic hip hop and the bartenders sling simple drinks Nothing remarkable about Redline but a good place all the same 
3XYmRANpUGu_ePUaaLgQ6w CMU Charlie s Kitchen is well Charlie s Kitchen It s a cheap place where come to sip on some of Cambridge s finest PBR or Miller High Life and chow on greasy bacon burgers and fries For that purpose its the perfect place 4 stars 
3YB_2Vo8vlYrLqplC12QrQ CMU This place is better in the Summer but still worth a trip in Winter if you re in the mood for cheap eats and draft beer The beer garden only open in sweet Summertime is the place to be in Harvard Square for happy hour and gets crowded by 5 p m most days Indoors feels pretty dive y but I kind of like that sometimes Service is spotty here every time I go a waiter has to revisit the table to ask again what we wanted but food is consistently good and did I mention cheap A fat burger and two beers is under 20 bucks I don t eat beef but I am a huge fan of their homemade salmon burger waffle fries Mmmm 
3YCD-GqCagM187wjpfw2sA CMU shrug I didn t quite get it It was like it was trying to be one thing but presenting you with a totally different thing are you a hipster bar what s with the metal blaring and yet the very middle aged milfs hanging out and sipping white wine it s so confusing I don t care either way are you a neighborhood place a destination bar for the burbs broads what make up your mind We could never call this place hipster in Portland this is like old people hipster like 40 somethings trying to feel hip and cool by over paying for beer hanging out in leather jackets and listening to metal My boy big fan of b side was pretty disappointed as well The decore wait staff and clientele are like complete opposites of each other I would get it more if it was maybe dirtier clubier something there was a definite feel of poser heavy in the air also the bartender was weird and slow really slow Their beer selection and tap list was big and nice variety I wasn t feelin beer so i asked about a vodka I hadn t hear of mind you by pointing to it in the menu The bartender says it s vodka and walked away wow really how did i miss the big bold lettering above it that said vodka she came back and i made my really face and she added oh it s from vermont there that wasn t so hard right anyways the prices were steep and the place was weird and the service was slow I d skip it unless you want to go in there and try and figure out the questions i posed above 
3Ye3lhXk_aVMLkeciHJL9A CMU Do you drink beer You ll love this place You don t drink beer Stay away That s all they have We didn t order any food at Charlie s and sat out on the ridiculously crowded patio with everyone else drinking beer I m not sure why when there are better bars on every corner in Cambridge 
3YPvYXhsLHT4RZHhwnu7BQ CMU Food deserves three or four but service is downright terrible Was there on a Sunday afternoon not busy at all Three people Asked if we could push two tables together No only one table per group Okay we ll squeeze around this two person table Menus dropped orders taken drinks brought Beers were good soda flat Mentioned the flat sodas to our server She said I can SEE the bubbles in it Yeah okay it was sugar water Have a taste if you d like it s completely flat She rolls her eyes I don t know how to adjust it so that s what you re gonna get if I bring it back The rest of the meal was similar Every time we asked for something even to order an extra dish we were met with a sneer and a sigh Good food nice small place with a good feel completely ruined by bad service 
3YsOFXgGPm7pXNOfvup0gA CMU In a sentence a small hole in the wall that has a very well priced oh kay lobster roll For the long version it s a small place with cheap twin lobster rolls 11 for two with fries The lobster roll is very well priced lots of mayo and celery though I wish it was warm though I believe it s a small lobster the claw was tiny So it s more like less quality but the price is just right for a college student s budget The oddest thing about this place is the tank of lobsters in the front It s like a bar with lobsters And the bathroom isn t so bad during the day I assume the reason why it s gross is because it s a shared one for guys and girls and you know how that goes 
3zRfXqeaYow7rczTBorgDQ CMU Come for the beer stay for the beer The beers are great Most recently we had chili chocolate porter and cherry stout and both were hearty and unique and well made Five stars for the beer The food We ve been twice and they re trying too hard with the free range fancy entrees They are okay as entrees at a price point around 15 better than the lame chain places that charge 12ish bucks but definitely not work the 20ish that they charge The sandwiches are an okay deal but I don t like the fries and I ve yet to try the pizzas but I need to stop trying to pretend that I can get great beer and a great meal 2 5 stars for the food quality for price But four stars for the service which has always been friendly and laid back and pretty good with the water refills Thus somewhere between three and four stars and I will go ahead and round up 
3ZVZaRu3FPSFmrIOdoN3wg CMU Harvest was very good but at their prices it should be The menu is diverse and eclectic which is always nice It s also little nicer than many Cambridge establishments esp in Harvard Square I would have given it 4 stars if it were a little cheaper but you won t be disappointed on the food and ambiance alone 
3_hfmk9_-d9Zr_yOdOPCxQ CMU I love the wall hanging menu of the periodic table The chef is very good and the selection offers just the right amount of choices 
40dNkVa8Zqkxn4xCA6S9Kg CMU Asked for Jack Daniel s on the rocks they gave me Evan Williams instead Guess they don t carry Jack and thought I wouldn t recognize the difference That kinda sucked I guess I expect more from a place like this and their bartenders 
40yae6jarFrOMlDQ5r6RqA CMU This place is what it is it s nothing special The one time I ate here it was for brunch and the food was not that great We want to hit it up during a night out to see how the bar scene is maybe it s better for that sort of thing 
41ny2dmrTNI7xcuEYcuh2w CMU I m not sure how I d managed to be a Cambridge Somerville resident for so long and never make it to Chuck s Probably because I hadn t heard about their 2 Ballantine s their what It s a beer I had never heard of it either or ever gotten so drunk I couldn t even see there how would I have done that without having been That s just the kind of thing Charlie s Kitchen makes plausible somehow I ve never really eaten here except for the occasional fry poached from a friend s plate but it s really the perfect place to put back ten or fifteen beers with some friends maybe over karaoke maybe when you re the only person in the bar It s the kind of place that s so casual that you feel like a regular even if it s the first time you ve walked in the door I wouldn t necessarily bring a date here although I have been brought here on a date Actually you know maybe if your date doesn t want to end up at Charlie s belting out Total Eclipse of the Heart at the end of the night you should go fishing for another date 
41vjcCpRUVBeG8gBVK2hcA CMU This place rocked Best lobster roll I ve ever had even better than on Cape Cod And the famous double cheeseburger lived up to the hype A thin patty ala Burger King but they cooked it medium rare to order and it was tasty Good fries too This place was a nice surprise great prices and really great diner style food with a Boston stamp on it 
42rbpHVFEtxCzicLsOjV1w CMU Cute waitresses The best thing is the burgers they rock If you want a quiet romantic spot this isn t what they do If you want to eat drink and be merry check it out 
43iJzgfvZzXM4SnYS25fbw CMU For restaurant week I got the soup the cod and the peach raspberry shortcake with the half glass wine pairing The wine was excellent I d say the soup was the best part of our meal I think the chef put some surprise crab bits in there which was delicious A bit pricey but worth the freshness of the food Corn from Verrill Farm YES 
44n9ZN_eos66gXGExy1YyA CMU It seems like the reviews for Charlie s fall mostly into two camps There s the I came here for dinner and wasn t happy with the service camp and the I came here wickedly drunk or looking to get wickedly drunk with a bunch of friends and it was awesome camp I can roll either way I wouldn t come here for the food alone at best you re talking about standard greasy bar food That said a few drinks in it can be exactly what you re looking for Sure it s a little weird that all the waitstaff take down your orders on PDAs and service isn t always the fastest but that s because this place is BUSY And it s busy because it s fun and pretty cheap And because it s open when other places aren t like on Christmas and Christmas Eve Until 2am Awesome 
46tGk0pqMhp8rwOBM7Kc1A CMU Went here for the first time this past weekend only to find out that they are closing the place and re opening it as a bistro Kind of bummed that I find a bar with great DJs right near my new apartment and they close right after I finally get to go there I had a great time the one time I got to go to the Redline 
477_LAX9kKLq7hGT45r5BA CMU I love this place primarily because I know many of the staff They are slammed at many times of the day but really sling the hash You ve heard of the science theme which is lightly played so let s focus on the food The burgers are good solid fare any time of day Consider going for the cheeseburger with blue cheese and NO catsup or just a little dollop to dip in Also the Turkey Chili is great the best secret to it however is to ask for grilled pita chips rather than the workaday Tostitos that otherwise will appear in it Want something lighter The chicken salad with cilantro dressing is a good choice If you play Horde in World of Warcraft sit at the bar and trade tips many of the bartenders are gonzo for that game Worst recent news item the prices took a leap upward Still a good place for your inner geek 
48Ah3RV8oU73mp1_KEsPMA CMU Why have I gone back to Meadhall so many times if every visit is completely underwhelming Because beer The service is mediocre at best but the beer list keeps me coming back Every time I ve gone maybe 10 of the beer list is kicked yet they refuse to update their printed paper menu Maybe they could learn a thing or two from Sunset in Allston They have an even more extensive menu but update it daily and will even detail the quantity available in some cases Although they mark the kicked kegs on the huge chalk board on the wall they do not erase it I ve seen Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA up there now for over a month Come on duders Beer bonerkill 
48kagWU04ZCH6ywoKy5m6A CMU Solid food great atmosphere for watching a game So the atmosphere is very pub which is great for watching a game any game baseball MNF or basketball take your pick There are TV s everywhere so you can catch the game while catching up with friends The food is actually surprisingly good to the point where I have actually come for a casual lunch that was not related to any kind of sports viewing The hummus is pretty good and the burgers there are lots of options take your pick are also tasty The service is pretty good and they do a good job of ducking when the sports fans get rowdy It can be a bit crowded but overall a great place to enjoy the game with friends and get some surprisingly good food 
48RXiES6Bm8dr27Qti4Oww CMU Modern relaxed cool bistro Unlike other places they didn t crank up the music too loud after 10 pm Has a bar and a bunch of long high tables perfect for any size group The draft beer selection is not huge but what they have is very good I had a nice stout The food menu is also pared down but it s definitely better to be great at a few things then just ok at many I had the Bacon Cheeseburger which was cooked perfectly and came with really nicely seasoned roasted potatoes and a small side salad The food was great and the portions just right I definitely plan to go back This is a great place to have a meal or just a drink Highly recommended 
49uIvrvYOx0roSnhccaKeQ CMU Two words Beer towers Okay so the food isn t exquisite They can make a tasty Cuban sandwich to the surprise of this Florida girl I really like their beer they re located conveniently close to the movie theater and I really like their beer Some quality stuff always available plus interesting seasonal choices and you can cart home a 1 2 gallon growler of your favorite 
4a007O7hp5e5Ll0vNFQf1Q CMU Standard brew pub Food s OK location is great 
4bSj-27bwYLTJsLBYG9w0g CMU In my humble opinion John Harvard s has the best bacon cheeseburger in the Boston area They need to open a place on my side of the river 
4c-O3t8I-JxfUGJDUwvj6Q CMU I went to this restaurant for 20 years Rolled through the changes they took away the salmon salad raised prices improved the beer But some things stayed steady always the Pale Ale stained glass TVs free bread plates When the new management came in at the end of last year they messed this place up in a lot of little ways The bread was no longer free and they didn t tell us By the time we found out it wasn t coming it was too late They were out of all the good beers We had to get a pitcher of something heavy that wasn t on the menu and turned out to be 20 The fish chips was tiny They gave us the wrong menu so the 3 tough ribs turned out to be 20 instead of 15 All the little stuff added up to one really depressing overpriced meal Maybe we ll go back in another 6 months see if they ve got it back together 
4D2IIJ9lGW6XzJGHI_FxCQ CMU You know a place is cool when your waitress has more tattoos than your tattoo artist peircings galore winks when she takes your order and doesn t make a face but welcomes the newcomer to your party who arrives at 20 minutes to closing time and orders two IPAs and shot of tequila Stat I was that newcomer Thank you to Charlies and my adorable waitress who s name I believe was Elizabeth for endulging my late night imbibing wind down 
4dp1mq-d7FNujpeQaFSw_g CMU Good place to grab a quick meal Food is good but I wasn t amazed by it It s pretty typical sandwiches salads It is cute how there is a periodic table menu though Decently priced and you get enough food for what you pay 
4eT56xlspQniyCWCIpwBgw CMU for boston its good pitchers of beer hard to find but you find it here I ve been to John Harvard s a number of times and I have never been disappointed Sure it s touristy but it also has some of the cheapest beer in Boston and the entrees aren t bad either Tell me where else you can get pitchers of good beer for a decent price This is where it s at 
4FkMi1NUE-x5ESrCLsXiHg CMU Like the decor and vibe Waitstaff are hard to flag down could be friendlier Service really needs to improve and keep up We like their regular cheeseburger and prefer it over their popular spicy one Like the homestyle fries hash too Good prices good beer 
4FxzAWuehJ1oX4wWmShxKw CMU I m on the fence about this place Love the beer and bourbon selection and it s pricey but not totally unreasonable The food on the other hand is way overpriced for the quality It s decent enough food but I ve started just drinking here It s almost always busy but not packed which is good or bad depending on what you re trying to do 
4gKtGiUpDb3vWcrHicfTnw CMU I came here with a friend and his godparents who are very fond of this place The decor is sleek with dark wood and white table linens The noise level is deafening which I found challenging since the godparents were get along in their years The portions were small but the food was excellent I had the Boston Bibb Salad with Grilled Marinated Shrimp Lemongrass Tangerines Almonds Creamy Lime Vinaigrette I didn t think it was very remarkable but still quite tasty As an entree I had the Grilled Mahi Mahi with Baby Bok Choy Finnan Haddie Sauce and I think the spinach It lacked flavor and had no real kick but maybe that s because I m into ethnic exotic foods The wine was delicious The only thing I really remember is the dessert which was a creme brulee It s really difficult to mess that up It was perfection The top was so crisp with a very satisfying crack when my spoon dug in 
4Gt-P2ncPldxfYlwCrBN-g CMU I don t have anything really bad to say about MC2 but nothing really stood out to me either I went here for lunch with my parents on a weekday The service was nice but I felt like they kept forgetting about us The food was good especially the rolls that they gave us initially and that were on my burger Its true that there is a serious lacking of dining options in the Kendall Square area and MC2 is a decent option 
4H-mhD4iZ0OSN1zW7F4uZA CMU We are from Boston and dropped in to this place on a stay cation weekend The bar is beautiful the beer is wonderful The staff knew the brew made excellent recommendations and we loved it Every beer was served in the proper glass unheard of on this side of the Atlantic and the best way to go We had some apps that were great They do need to work on the cohesion between bar and kitchen they have only been open a month and I have NO doubt they will get there 
4H2SKpaBpSfZ0vyNRxg9Ag CMU I ve been to Miracle of Science and loved its simplicity a solid burger done right full of smoky flavor and juicy to the last bite The same ownership has fairly recently opened Tory Row in Harvard Square with an overall menu that is far more impressive but still boasting a burger that very closely resembles the Miracle of Science offering It definitely feels different on the interior less nerdy in a scientific way like MOS and a little more cleaner grown up in a Harvard sort of way if that makes any sense at all Unfortunately on this Thursday night it s crowded and boy is it tiny so we re forced to stand pressed against the glass wall glaring at the lucky patrons fortunate enough to be seated There really is no waiting area unless you count the bar I don t and on a below freezing night it s certainly not very enjoyable to catch a breeze every time the door opens The burger is mostly the same as MOS flat with a ciabatta type bun and grilled It comes with the same potatoes although ours come cold and with the same spicy aioli The Tory Row burger comes with bacon which is lovely flavor wise but is so scarce I forget it s on the burger and the pickles add a nice touch But there s too much red onion for my taste and the burger while still delicious is a tad over cooked and what started out as juicy dries out a touch as I near the end The bun is nice and crusty but is almost too much you really have to work to harmonize the bun and burger into one perfect bite otherwise you end up with too much bread and not enough beef But it s the same smoky beef flavor over cooked or not it remains one of my favorites in Boston perfectly salty and bursting with flavor Overall the menu is a big upgrade here perfect pub fare in my opinion it s more refined and attempting to be a bit more upscale but is it better Based on the burger alone I d have to say no 
4h4n-m1MCJ0fC8prThaBfw CMU Was in Boston for a meeting and a friend and I thought we would check it out We walked in when they first opened and were over whelmed with the smell of bleach I guess that is good that the place is clean but why Is it really dirty The staff is very attentive and the beer is good The menu is average and standard If in Boston again not a must do 
4HlgzaFFIUIToXHC_QQgKQ CMU Not bad for a group or brunch otherwise skip it 
4hRU68_k5ZNygJ5k35ZRxw CMU Since 2000 hit I assumed I was the biggest geek for staying in my perpetual 90s music mode continuing my quest to hang tough and vogue I found my musical soulmates Thursday night at Redline home of 90s dance party The DJs rocked the music the bartenders were awesome and I vogued with my music soulmates all night long While it took a little bit for the dance floor to fill shame on you who didn t dance why come to a 90s party and not expect to shake a little booty soon people were breaking out their best running mans A fabulous Thursday night and not so fun Friday morning 
4IrOYfYavL32IQo7CoprpQ CMU The style is very contemporary with warm neutral colors and an airy feel The other diners seemed very Cambridge esque kind of pretentious to me The service was really excellent I had the Market Green Salad Seared Atlantic Salmon and Soft Chocolate Cake The salad was what you expect nice and light attractively presented The Salmon was out of this world delicious I loved the beets The potato puree was pink from the beet juice and created a lovely visual Jen didn t like her pork much though I never tried it It apparently was tough and flavorless My chocolate cake was good very like a molten cake my favorite but served cold I would have preferred it warm Jen s sorbet was wonderful I loved this meal especially my entree 
4ivyVpJFjtnQfg6i1wlYuQ CMU Do you miss the B Side Lounge Too bad Get over it Life moves on Carry on Stiff upper lip and all that You know what you have now Lord Hobo Embrace the Hobo Do you hear me Embrace the Hobo Hobo will become a neighborhood haunt in absolutely no time at all I m not going to ooze niceties the place does not need it The place is a sum of it s parts And being a newly opened bar and restaurant of course has a few bugs to work out Hell I was there the very first night they opened their doors of course there were a few glitches but I really don t think they are even worth mentioning What is worth mentioning 1 The wait staff Super friendly knowledgeable and working at dizzying speed on a super busy night Last night was sort of a soft opening for friends and family of the Hobo and crap hell I feel like a second cousin but what the hell of course I went 2 The crowd Pretty much what you would expect Cambridge folk indie scenesters hipsters hippies artists business folk restaurant snobs beer nerds liquor nerds vegetarians meat eaters all of whom look strikingly familiar 3 The seating Individual tables group tables and plenty of room at the bar Don t be shy cozy up to a neighbor and drunkenly slur on about the old B Side for a while There are benches and bar stools not messy upholstered chairs to be soiled with spilled drinks and fried tidbits 4 The beer list Yeah it s pretty much all that It doesn t go for the we have every beer in the world thing Rather it sort of achieves the whatever you like that is a quality beer we either have it or have something similar to it that you will like No swill beer to be had here Deal with it No hot dogs either 5 The food Speaking of lack of hot dogs get the french fries Awesome fries w gravy or curry That s like the cheap appetizer to share Hell it s probably enough to have if you just want a snack The gravy yeah you ll want to drink it But don t that s just crass Save room for the fried oysters they are like Hershey Kisses from the sea The cheese and meat plate is both mysterious and strangely addictive I did not order the lobster mac and cheese but I stole some from my neighbor she was not pleased about this but I was 6 The other stuff For an opening night and I really do take this as a vision of things to come they really did have their act together My buddy the chef was grinning ear to ear that is also a good thing Guys were there from local glossy magazines from Beer Advocate and from all makes and models of local favorite haunts The decor is simple the tone of the place warm I m quite sure this is all in process and if you are one of those people that judges a book by it s cover then your impression of the place will be warm red with simple lighting I didn t even describe the drinks or wine you will have to figure that out on your own I ll just leave this as yes please more 
4jOs7NVDAyf5byiV0uF84w CMU This place is first and foremost about the beer The waitress was not even remotely knowledgeable about the beer menu but the selection is unreal Even though the menu is super pretentious they had a good 4 dollar kolsch on tap and many beers were available in the 6 dollar range The food is pricey for a bar menu but fairly good The chicken lollipop appetizer was fantastic The mixed greens consisted of 30 cents worth of lettuce for 6 dollars My whole party enjoyed their cheeseburger chicken breast and salmon entrees respectively The restaurant is dark and loud and caters to a hipster 20 something beer snob crowd The restaurant was totally overwhelmed on the Sunday night I went and my party spent more than 2 hours waiting on 2 courses We had the buywithme to use when we went meaning the food was half off For half off this place is an absolute steal For full price there s no reason to venture out to Cambridge when places like the Publick House are closer 
4K98LqTNsvk8CNrwsE-9og CMU Gah So frustrating There is a lot of potential here but Meadhall just seems to be squandering it Beer is the star here so let s talk about that The good stuff first They have a lot of taps A hundred ish a guess And every pour I ve had has been clean which can be a problem sometimes when places have a ton of beers They have some good beers on tap BUT With the exception of a few of the Belgian ales I had tried everything on their list Almost everything they have is widely available around here Spice it up fellas Also while the branded glassware is nice it s not always the appropriate glass for the style of beer there are serving A minor nitpick obviously but it s true Also the printed beer menu lumps beers together by style in a very hamhanded way and doesn t offer any descriptions of the beers The food I dunno It s too expensive to order Okay the burger isn t too expensive It is probably the best deal in the place at around 12 Make that 13 if you want cheese Since an order of fries is 6 on their own getting the burger and fries for 13 is a steal The burger itself isn t anything to write home about Decent beef a nice roll cooked almost how I ordered it I asked for cheddar cheese and got melty orange cheese that they might be calling cheddar but tasted pretty dang American to me The Bratwurst also sounds like a good deal also around 12 until it arrives and you realize you only get one puny brat and a tiny mound of potato salad for the price Tasty though The rest of the entrees are in the 25 range and based on what I ve tried I have no interest in spending that much on any item they offer Basically they need to rethink their menu In a place that is marketing itself as a beer drinking destination they need more affordable drinking food options If they added a couple sandwiches to the menu I could forgive a lot of their shortcomings Also they should add at least one more bratwurst per order just saying Anyway this is pretty long already but I feel the need for a conclusion Even with all the things I don t like about it I m still glad it s in the neighborhood I have high hopes that due to the sheer number of taps they have if they rotate regularly I am bound to find something new and exciting here one of these days I m definitely going to come back but for now I m just not enthusiastic about this place 
4KAdFyC9wc_7zUfj2PdhVg CMU Who would have thought that a brewhouse as big as this could exist amongst the crowded streets and restaurants of Harvard Square The door looks so small from the outside and then the moment you walk in there are high ceilings and tables everywhere I actually almost had to call Matt J in order to find him and his friends since this place is big enough to hide in I d say One person in our group loved his cuban sandwich and it did smell like bacon which made me like it at least a little bit and the other food I saw come out actually didn t look half bad for bar food But the beers I had expected a little more from especially for a place that seems overall like a pretty chill spot to hang out in with a group I tried two of their beers and they just weren t anything special but they weren t bad either so really a good average spot to hang out at One weird thing is that they have flat screens everywhere except for in one or two spots where they have some of the oldest models of TVs possible Pretty funny to see those amongst the flat screen HDs and you would think that with the money they make off their beer and selling those giant jugs of beer to go they could afford to buy one or two more flat screens ha 
4mB9DkYgCov91Esto_EXBA CMU Cool place I had the best cheeseburger I ve had since my time in Cambridge Very juicy with a little spice The potatoes on the side were also good My dad had a good veggie burger he said I was a little surprised that for a place that I knew was known for its burgers that it didn t have more of a selection There are about 5 types of burgers The periodic table menu is cute But I kind of wish they gave out paper menus too Not everyone is far sighted Shipyard 4 50 pint Nice I liked the exposed brick and the seating overall I was sitting by the drafty door though which sucked It was kind of loud inside but it definitely has a quirky student y feel 
4MJCHjqhM7rHlni3O96szg CMU Very interesting building it looks like it used to be a garage of some sort I had the Ronie Burger which has jalapenos mixed in with the meat and it was very good I particularly liked the roasted potatoes that came with it instead of fries Beers were 4 00 which is pretty decent for Cambridge Service was a little lax and we generally had to flag our waiter down for drinks but once we did they always came promptly I ll definitely be back 
4N9v1yIPNGuisD9BlLMnQQ CMU After months upon months of searching for a restaurant that sells sweet as well as fried plantains rice with pigeon peas beans and steak within the Cambridge Somerville area I thankfully discovered this gem of a restaurant that is conveniently located in the Area IV neighborhood I no longer have to travel long discouraging distances to have such a fine Hispanic Caribbean cuisine Walking into Izzy s for the first time I immediately noticed the Puerto Rican influenced decor throughout the restaurant There are a variety of photographs of the natural beauty of Puerto Rico as well as important figures of the island This particular restaurant has more of a traditional welcoming atmosphere that will not only disappoint but will only encourage you to come back for another visit in the near future As far as food goes I ordered steak and onions as well as yellow rice with pigeon peas kidney beans and a side order of sweet plantains Needless to mention as a Dominican my order most certainly lived up to my expectations The taste of the sliced onions absorbed into the steak I had at the moment which gave it such a flavorful taste overall The yellow rice and sweet plantains that quickly vanished from my plate tasted just as if they were homemade by my grandmother absolutely delicious The kidney beans however tasted as if they had just been poured from a can which in my honest opinion is disappointing The kidney beans certainly have such an unappealing taste that will only force you to push them to the side in favor of the rest of this order hence the four star rating Furthermore the staff in this restaurant are very down to earth and treat their customers with the utmost respect Friendliness is present as well as patience They are more than willing to guide you through their menu and your order They also make the most ultimate effort to satisfy their customers in any possible way One particular example of customer satisfaction in this restaurant is when I jokingly asked the staff in Spanish D nde est la m sica Music was not playing inside the restaurant at the time I was present hence the question that had been asked Shortly after music of the Perico Ripiao genre started playing through the airwaves which then brought out such an authentic atmosphere in this restaurant It certainly put a smile on my face and made me feel much more at home my experience here in Izzy s was then complete If you currently live in the Cambridge Somerville Arlington area and are searching for an authentic Puerto Rican or perhaps a Hispanic Caribbean cuisine that s conveniently located near a bus stop and or the Red Line stop searching at this very moment and look no further Izzy s will come to the rescue 
4NrtfA-4F2XKjRJgrqGqlA CMU This is the first restaurant I visited in Boston I had dinner here with my family The ambiance was really nice The service was really good The servers where very attentive The food was good but could have been a little more creative 
4Oj5QDNg7VXQtRWE06DLcA CMU Great place to hang out and get a bite to eat with friends Burgers are solid as well as their kebabs Tasty and affordable Nice laid back atmosphere Menu is written out like a periodic table When they first opened they used to serve beer and drinks in pyrex flasks 
4PdtKXX1rtFEAPaDe2zaLQ CMU I stopped by here for a drink the other night and my initial thoughts are that The interior is slick but a little too sterile looking but The staff are great The beer selection is huge The art on the wall is cool The bad is there doesn t seem to be any beers under 5 which means I ll only be here for a few beers as too many of the beers available are mad expensive and is too much for my wallet even tho I love them thar wicked mad dear strong beers But they just opened so give the lads some time to fine tune things I mean they do have a great friggin beer selection that you won t find anywhere inside 495 Gotta try the food next time The B Side is dead God bless her and all who sailed in her Long live the Hobo 
4QAIZjUveakGMJTP-eqkjw CMU My friends and I were coming from a food tasting near Kendall and were JUST slightly buzzed and decided we needed some more booze we walked around for about 15 20 minutes before totally running into this place I have been here before and enjoyed the experience Although last time it was later in the evening and the place was pretty full and loud This time we arrived around 3pm and MH was only about 20 capacity We ordered the hummus and the fries with garlic aoili We all pretty much devoured both plates and ordered about 4 beers each Please don t ask me to remember which beers but I will say that we enjoyed them all The service was fine they enjoyed our jokes as we got drunker they loved the one about us not seeing Budlite listed on the beer list Ha I would recommend Mead Hall as a place to chill have a few drinks and get a nice buzz on Just be careful as some of the beers are way high in alcohol and catch up to you fast 
4QfHBR0jVtycDDY6Hp57Ew CMU I love the atmosphere of this place It s pretty dark There are some booths to hide in The servers range from nice to I don t give a crap the music is usually interesting There are amazing beers on tap always something that I haven t tried The food is super good There is cool art on the wall The bathrooms are clean The downs Sometimes the music just plain sucks I have had a couple of all female I m sad to say horrible servers The food and beer are expensive Their beer menu seems to be heavy on the barleywine IPA style beers barleywines aren t good for driving home and I m not a fan of IPAs But I still love visiting it when I m in the area I think it is a must for any beer lover visiting living in Boston 
4u60tHDLloXRTVdp0QaBpA CMU My favorite spot in Boston Dinner and drinks are very good Yummy cocktails and a good beer selection nice ambience fun for people watching good service good crowd and good music The DJ plays 90s hip hop and some new music very fun for dancing I definitely recommend this place 
4UJz0D4eNfELIN8kB1-11g CMU I come here more than I should The food is great and I enjoy the atmosphere What keeps me from coming is that the wait time for a simple egg and cheese exceeds 20 minutes almost consistently Management does what they can do and I truly appreciate their effort Try as they may their energy and motivation is always lost on their employees who are slow lazy miserable and who obviously hate their jobs while failing to make any attempt to hide that fact Their operational incompetence is where I place the blame for such sluggish service that is a hallmark of this particular location I d really like to see new cashiers and sandwich bar people that don t keep me waiting for my entire break and who might want to hustle a bit That way if it s slow it s because they are actually busy and not just because they are bad workers 
4WLyMvRKAXKnIovSz6bmMw CMU The beer is decent the food is meh I feel bad dropping that turd in the punchbowl but there s really not much more to say Their beer is good They appear to have outsourced their kitchen to an Applebee s though That s the level of quality you re getting Hey free WiFi though 
4x8764QM4fB70WIapjTH7Q CMU John Harvard s is a good place to be aware of in Harvard Sq but it s hard for anyone to actively dislike so it usually makes a good compromise place to eat Atmosphere is fun food is good enough menu has all the standards price is decent The burgers are extremely good and a definite safe bet Salads are pretty good too Parking isn t the easiest but it is Harvard Sq so plenty of ways to get there 
4XAiKJwT9LbsvB0vqQuHhA CMU Five star beer selection including the 4 flavorful house brew Nicely done interior including the bathroom Unimaginative brunch dishes hiding behind fancy descriptions priced too high for what you get Very slow service in a half empty restaurant 
4xBokfH3dPVqwd9nDNgaGQ CMU I have been going to this place with friends on Monday nights for about a year and absolutely love it The burgers are great and come with their own special potatoes that are great no fries here The turkey chili is one of the best chilis I have had The spices are somewhat unique and it is actually more soupy than thick but the flavors are amazing so if you like chili you need to check this out 
4y0wKR8yBWEuUIp-zvugfw CMU The whole Periodic Table as menu idea is cute but when several tables are not within view of said Periodic Table and there are no paper menus to be had that s just annoying I had to get up and stand in the middle of the restaurant to make my decision My chicken sandwich was fine but not especially memorable The dude got the signature burger with the jalapenos mixed in with the meat the bite I tried was okay but nothing to write home about I did like the potatoes served on the side I could probably have used some more of those potatoes to soak up all the vodka sodas and various shots I proceeded to drink The space is cool but super crowded By the time our large group of friends arrived there was absolutely no way were were going to be able to congregate around the table and we had to move to the bar area No big deal it was a Saturday night after all but the place does get pretty packed The clientele was an interesting mix of students and young professionals Much to my amusement one member of a tableful of college girls decided to send the dude a drink mere moments after the waitress had chided us for canoodling then proceeded to go out of her way to ignore him middle school style for the remainder of the evening It was strange and hilarious And our waitress was otherwise very accomodating especially when we had to chase her down to be sure she was bringing us Patron and not Cuervo 
4ZDQySQL4F1LYMs6vRFB_w CMU Amazing selection of healthy food Most things on the menu have nutritional information printed in the description If they don t there s a kiosk that has everything I just don t understand why there are SO MANY TABLES crammed into this little place Also why are there birds flying around inside 
4_eE2_ljzsmg8u3LPnw__g CMU We landed here one evening when Central Square was impossible to park in I was exasperated with science after a long day at lab Let s just call it any evening I was hungry and underwhelmed by the decor in MoS I was thinking there would be some miraculous flatware or beers served in beakers cocktails in graduated cylinders I wanted to see something truly miraculous and more scientific than those crap stools I sit on all day in lab or those epoxy slate tables I spend all day spilling toxic substances on let s face it epoxy tables hide yucky things very well The periodic table menu wasn t cutting it I was so over MoS I just wanted a cocktail some food and to make like the wind I first asked for a cocktail menu the server looked at me as if I d blinded him with science I ll take a sidecar I snapped I waited tapped my fingers shot dirty looks had an attitude but as soon as my sidecar arrived things started looking up In a sweeter tone I asked for a Ronie Burger When my burger arrived I searched for the jalapenos I wanted my spice Turns out they were diced into the beef which was cooked perfectly to medium rare The home fries were so scrumdiddlyumptious that if my mother had been there I might have jumped up to slap her what s that sauce they bed the potatoes on Apparently the miracle at MoS isn t really the science it s the food unless you re Alton Brown and food is science I know too much 
52xFAw2DGkMHadd5ouvQPA CMU I went to Miracle around 8 30 on a Friday night Of course there was no seating to be had my co workers and I waited just about a half an hour fror a table In the meantime I enjoyed a nice cold UFO draft which impressed me because it s not always easy to find After we sat down we ordered quesadillas which were pretty good though not outstanding I wish I ordered a veggie kebab The prices are fairly average for Central Square with drinks being somewhat cheap The service wasn t terrible and we were able to watch the line for Middlesex out the window and head over there at an opportune time I wasn t wowed but nothing in my experience would warrant a bad review I think I ll try it again on a less busy night 
53QDG0LNW9JZ8DxeEEfzvQ CMU They have great beer And mediocre to sometimes outright crap food What you want to do is stick to the basics like burgers and boneless buffalo wings If you go for anything fancy you will be hugely disappointed Example Last night we ordered the wings quite good and the brie appetizer Booooooo 1 Brie just a little above room temperature definitely not ooey and gooey You know how grilled brie has black lines on it from the grill I felt like they had put theirs on fake like with a magic marker and then microwaved the brie for 10 seconds 2 Crap fruit preserves of some kind on it Looked like they had scooped it out of a jar Cold and useless 3 Completely undressed greens 4 Crostini old crappy toast You know when you make toast and forget about it and it gets cold and brittle That was their crostini Service and speed of food coming out was great At any rate beer enthusiasts should go here and try lots of different beers and don t order anything on the menu that is the least bit fancy in any way and you will have a great time 
54188bW_VBws3mDDrD1SDA CMU Redline is a very nice spot Its a bar but with some flair The food is good The place is clean and has a modern new england feel I like to go there on Thursday nights to dance of the week My roomates are the DJ s but no thats not the only reason I like it The drinks are fairly cheap for boston and the vibe is totally fun and friendly I feel relaxed and at home there dancing to songs that take me back to the seventh grade I love it 
550jAt66FTkuKynz53MBRQ CMU The draft beer selection is a bit peculiar very different but refreshingly so Don t expect your typical midwestern domestics The bartenders are alert and actually pretty darned friendly But the crowd there can be a bit of a downer I ve been here 5 times and I generally like to think that I m an un assuming kind of guy Usually friendly never angry on a nice weekend night but everytime I go here I get someone that isn t happy or too drunk or just not having a good night up in my face and letting me know how upset they are It s not me I think I go to the last drop and don t get any trouble or even the draft in allston and never have had the kind of flack I get here Generally the people here are great But I always seem to find that one bad egg around closing I guess So I m going to have to downgrade it as I d like to give it a good rating due to the bartenders and the general atmosphere that I dig outdoor seating is super sweet I guess I just might have horrible luck here Ce la vie 
55XPXf2qQ5EwtLojlJYn3Q CMU This bar is 90 atmosphere and 10 everything else As I am sure you have gleamed from the name of the bar it s science themed The menu is written in the form of a giant periodic table on a blackboard very cool idea The prices are reasonable and the wait staff was attentive but did not bug you It is not a bar I d go to every weekend but its definitely a cool place to bring friends who are visiting from out of town I m going to go back again 
575OazbxbgF5yKh1Wf9XKQ CMU Beer selection is outstanding ambiance is great Any Wolavers beer is my recommendation as are the French fries Great after work packed and fun Not an impressive Saturday night scene though definitely an evening place Hummus plate is great too The bartenders are helpful and give samples 
5aCUc-QG2_F0Fs0qOkifGg CMU The beer is TOP NOTCH The food is excellent The service is attentive without being hovering They re friendly and VERY knowledgeable The atmosphere is first rate It s clean welcoming and subtly states stay enjoy yourself and have a good time If I could own run promote a brewpub it would be CBC with a brick oven for pizza 
-1-LqeEjMy5nKkfFklkvtA CMU I used to work here and I liked it at the time Now I feel that since it s probably the biggest bar in the downtown area it s like the go to place for a lot of people and just gets way too busy Also I have friends that want to go there ALL THE TIME so I feel like I m kind of burnt out on it But then again if you want to go to a place that will almost always be busy it s right up your alley 
-p7xO7nbPYggBv8y3b3OPQ CMU I like the beer selection but we went there for a birthday party where I brought a cake and they wanted to charge me a 5 plate fee It was so absurd we had all bought dinner a bottle of wine etc It seems like they don t want groups to converge there I ll go somewhere else next time 
-VEwlYs3f_2Ui8yyvVMzmA CMU First class breakfast served in an interesting and inviting atmosphere Ensconsed in an old building in downtown Urbana Courrier Cafe is definitely a cut above the typical restaurants in U of I s hometown We were pleasantly surprised My wife had the Ham and Scram and a side of pumpkin pancakes that were on special The eggs were well cooked and the ham was really tasty It had the right hint of smokines which I thought was particularly pleasant I had the Spanish omlette which as usually happens in gringo joints was billed as hot by our waitress It was merely low medium Generous shots of hot sauce kicked my dish up to the real heat level for me Delicious coffee and really nice bread that made excellent toast was also provided Attentive service but the restaurant only had ten patrons when we were there right at opening so it may not be representative Not worth a special trip to Champaign Urbana but if you are in town or even passing by a slight detour to patronize it is worth it 
00greMBGiIJ7mQF5rSxSIw CMU I am really torn apart by the Courier Cafe I will go there and it will be amazing all around then the next time I go I will get awful service For example last night I went there with a group of four for dinner and waited 10 minutes to even get our drinks ordered Once the waiter even comes by he doesn t even say hi and is very unfriendly Throughout the meal we do not get refills and barely see the waiter Then once we get our dinner plates he hands us the checks Talk about being rushed out of a place I guess they don t want to sell desert or after dinner drinks This is unfortunate because the food is great The burger are good value and the friend chicken dinner is one of the best around town The milkshakes are the best I have ever had I will refuse to be a regular customer though after my last experience It is now just a place to go once in a great while or for a shake The only reason they got three stars is because of the food otherwise it would be a one 
03npOrUQKj4AIvhwl6K2xQ CMU I am writing strictly about a lunch experience The service was a bit mediocre but the place has a bright and interesting atmosphere The honey turkey wrap was delicious and the portions were quite filling 
073eSi-Epn3bY1yJk5U53w CMU Courier Cafe milkshakes are the BEST IN THE WORLD Seriously their milkshakes are to die for It s awesome because they ll give you one glass plus a metal cup of the stuff that didn t fit in the glass Perfect for sharing or for splurging Every single milkshake I ve had here has been thick creamy and full of hand dipped goodness One of my favorites peanut butter and fudge In terms of food their salad bar is always a good choice fresh and lots of variety and I really like their chicken pesto pita Whatever you order though make sure you get a milkshake 
0BvQDUTI74VzwzPJmff4Jw CMU Second visit Is enjoyable I think due to the unique menu and the ambiance of the old newspaper office Rueben and onion rings are good Wife had the turkey club and both shared the potato skins appetizer All good and will go back as there appears many more items to try 
0bxjHj_Rl3c3z-AvC43Dzg CMU Been here once for lunch once for dinner and once late night Honestly the crowds were biggest during lunch definitely unusual for a campus bar The food was okay typical bar food but Legend s is better 2 stars for the food drink and party atmosphere 4 stars for the fact that it is CLEAN pretty and well decorated so a 3 over all 
0DLsB3av7W93u4O9FR_4sw CMU I am rating the food Not the bar Let s say I take a thin ground beef patty and take a mallet and pound the crap out of it so that it s shape isn t even round any more That is their Backdraft Burger Don t even try to order a medium rare one They are all cooked the same like a fast food joint Was disappointed with their burger As far as the bar environment I would give that three stars 
0FQwVXYGZO-M1CSt0dLc0A CMU I was hesitant to come here but it is super close to my fiance s work so we decided to go I ordered a side salad and my fiance and I split an appetizer of nachos They were really salty and just well not good My salad was fine but I had asked the waitress to put the dressing on the side and instead it was slathered everywhere We also split a burger which was decent but very very heavy I think I maybe had 3 bites of it My partner also ordered a drink special a Long Island Iced Tea that came back to us blue They said it was the Illini special though I have no idea how seeing how our colors are orange and blue and not light bluish green Bottom Line Save your money and support a local restaurant instead 
0sR8OgwAiBzriRyM0W1sEQ CMU Oh Firehaus I really wish you were better but with your normally absentminded waitresses and bartenders who on weekend nights are stuck up how can I really I think that you re tolerable on Mondays when I can kind of hear myself think the bartenders are the new ones and not completely jaded and I can drink cuervo silver margaritas for 3 But Firehaus my experience with you is generally bad The lines are ridiculous the music is overwhelmingly loud my friend s credit card got closed out to the wrong person and had someone else s drinks on it and his last name is not Smith or Jones or anything common What You did to get on my last nerve Once I was there and a seasoned bartender dipped a glass in the ice bin and it came up broken which means there was glass in the ice bin I pointed it out and so he got another glass and dipped it back in the same ice bin with glass in it Gross Their food is OK but overrated Bah Firehaus I will definitely not miss you when I move away 
0UFsGBg30kqR9gI8xl9esA CMU Love the atmosphere An awesome place for getting into a great conversation with someone The shake is very customizable u can mix different flavors you will find your favorite after some good digging and experimentation 
0vQnAwe9p1kDzr16jHoDMg CMU I have eaten here a few times and never been overly impressed with this place Last night I ate here and ordered the Tomato and Pesto grilled cheese Huge mistake My grilled cheese came out with one slice of hard dried to the bread cheese on two huge pieces of Texas toast It was so dry I had to ask for marinara sauce to dip it in just to choke it down So not worth it flavorless and disgusting Kinda like how I feel about everything else I have ordered there OK for drinks but avoid the food Oh and don t bother complaining to the GM Andy He could care less Way to keep customers 
14TBnOWDTuZ6HxPcxeoY0Q CMU Never again This is a terrible place for anybody looking to enjoy themselves If having fun is not your thing check out Fat City My second time here confirmed in spades the general feeling of badness I got the first visit The first time a year ago was a weekend night and they had a lot of people All the garbage that comes with a large half and half campusy crowd was there that time They had keg service outside in a busted little shed plastic cups long lines beer foam splashing all over and a full compliment of asshats Inside the place doesn t look that bad They have dark wood accents a selection of booths tables and a long bar They have 2 nice pool tables a shuffle puck table you dont have to pay for the machine to keep score there s an app for that now a new golden tee and a couple of other games that looked playable The second time I went was a Tuesday night I realize Tuesday is a polarizing night for bars but I am solidly in the camp of lovers of bars on the empty side A group of grad students I run with had called ahead letting the place know we would be coming en masse Many of this crew refused to come I surmise based upon how terrible this bar is So we had about 80 less people there than we warned them about ahead of time So the service was great right Nope The worst I ve experienced in Champaign Urbana Drinks took literally 20 minutes One bartender with ADHD had a system for remembering what everybody had was running around like a chicken with his head cut off The guy was really trying but he did not do his job efficiently at all he would ask you what you wanted listen to the very first thing you said then turn away and get right on it before you were done talking He would then stop preparing your drink order mid way to take care of somebody else and their extended family He would then serve up your drink and act like you were the jerk because you wanted two additional drinks Those three drinks will cost you 9 plus 20 35 minutes of your life This system led to a half dozen or more people at any given time stuck in the purgatory between ordering a drink s receiving said drink s and paying for same The music system sucks A really muddy sound that makes old standards hardly understandishable and the bar artificially loud In the nearly empty bar described above it was hard to hear even those near to you and doubly hard to communicate with the bartender It was easier to hear elsewhere but they must put the speakers over the bar so the bartender can t hear complaints The food sucks Terrible selection of boring pub grub standards of BBQ d meat fried meat crappy frozen crinkle cut fries On Tuesday they have 2 00 margaritas that are TERRIBLE Bottom shelf tequila plus too much bottom shelf margarita mix over ice no blend option Oh yeah there is an old guy sitting at the end of the bar talking loudly to himself The aforementioned sound quality makes this even creepier as only occasional strains of his soliloquy find their way through the muddy garbage music they play here Classic Rawk 2 steps below NOW I really thought about giving this place 2 stars for the following reasons 4 bottles of good beers like Rogue Dead Guy and Bell s Oberon and a shuffle puck table new Golden Tee Pre Yelping the place in my head I was resigned to give them 2 stars as a recognition of such efforts even if they were not reflected in positive results Then my buddy got his Blue Moon draft in a plastic cup 
1aabcMlwVBmkOgZwo-2jdA CMU I ve eaten at a lot of great places in my absence so prepare for a string of gushing reviews Despite being extremely busy on a home game day our group of 4 was able to score outdoor seating pretty much right away Our waitress was nice and as attentive as she could be for having to wait on 10 tables at once You could tell the cafe was going for more of an old school thing with it s antique register wooden everything menu items etc For brunch on such a gorgeous late summer day my friends and I knew we HAD to sit outside I can definitely see myself coming back to relax with a newspaper book and a sandwich Plus I hear their milkshakes are pretty good so I guess I ll have to try that out as well Did I mention their portions here are pretty much huge My friend and I split their Dagwood and Desert Dippers healthy right and were STUFFED afterwords The quality of the food itself wasn t anything special but it still hits the spot when you haven t had anything to eat all day like us I ll be back here for sure 
1BW--n7SRAtRqKE8rHMl7w CMU Great salad bar and service but everything else is terrible Do not waste your money 
1Iobyi_7BkFON25Oegs0aw CMU Love their subs Cheap and top shelf ingredients 
1jeOOnRgltiUQ-f6Pdtw_Q CMU When there were no restaurants in downtown Urbana the Courier was a go to place The food was never spectacular and even the burgers which were a draw back then now when there are other possibilities for having a burger are actually quite greasy and fatty The airplane fan is very nice but can t carry the weight of diner food that isn t even really good diner food The shakes phosphates and sundaes are worth a trip and the cherry pie is nice too Breakfasts do have their fans but in my experience the home fries are always dry the eggs often overcooked or tepid and the it s not worth the wait on a weekend 
1KbcRXRxMZ4x89HYMTCACw CMU I have been here twice on a Monday afternoon around 4 30 having a beer and nachos I think the nachos are really good We have always had great service and it s never crowded because of the time obviously However I am not that impressed with anything Maybe I should try more items and then write a review But I also got a ticket while parked in the metered parking lot I know it s my fault for miscalculating but it still pisses me off 
1m-8cvhVsGOVOOCimt-7Gg CMU Corn Beef Pastrami with fries were gooooood good They serve Green River soda This place knows what s up I m not much of a deserts guy but you have to get their banana split Huge serving Great vanilla taste 
1X7kVjEtRrd8Mp6_RLHcmw CMU Best bar food in campus town I always get battalian burger The bartender s here are fantastic I really love the service here and I always come here with friends when they visit I feel the negative service complaints may be from wiper packed weekends like dads weekend or homecoming where every bar will be backed up I love this bar and many of my college memories came from here 
2-igE6hTkHRzgE3IPyUfxQ CMU I eat here semi frequently because there is a lack of mid range priced restaurants in town that aren t thai chinese korean etc and this has some meals that I would classify as mid range in price i e about 8 for a meal plus tip and tax I think the food is ok but some of the stuff on the menu is just overpriced 
2CNLaafTmLCYqrp6_e0Qjw CMU I love Crane Alley They have a great selection of sandwiches at reasonable prices and the best beer selection in town I find the Friday Saturday specials are always creative and amazing You can t go wrong with the frequently offered Beef Ragout Nachos but bring 2 3 people to help you finish Seating outside is quite pleasant except then you miss interacting with the friendly bartenders inside The service is friendly with just the right amount of attentiveness and they are nice to our dogs 
2dBdz4JPtI-aSdYvtQtQVQ CMU Awesome range of food and beer and the atmosphere is nice This place has to be one of my top 5 in Champaign Urbana especially in the summer when you can sit in the actual alley itself Not to mention this place is great for some low key billiards and beer after dinner 
2EyB1R5zPUa-HE2OY2AvZg CMU To be blunt I m baffled at the amount of love the burgers here received on Yelp Really just not that good The meat was dry and overcooked the toppings were boring and it was pretty small The only reason this place received 3 stars from me was the OUTSTANDING soup The roasted corn and poblano chowder was absolutely delicious I wanted to stop by the nearest U of I frat house and borrow a beer bong to take down a vat of this soup yea it was that good Overall the Courier Cafe just feels kind of old kind of like the burgers taste but do yourself a favor and order a giant bowl of that soup 
2Mf3F2OuPgPUG9FF6MXrBw CMU I am from Champaign raised there until the age of 20 when I escaped to Austin I still go back every year for Christmas to visit family and friends and when I do Seven Saints is a must hit place for food And I get the same thing every single time The Triple S Combo Platter One salmon slider BLT salad although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad sounds weird but was really tasty And the tomato basil soup This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off possibly a bad day But every year it always pleases me And the bill isn t so bad I don t really drink here but have had a mojito that was alright nothing special I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting Please stay in business Seven Saints otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won t be pretty 
2r15uCVW7im7Amk_Yn7P_A CMU Ate here Saturday evening 12 10 11 for dinner with my girlfriend Ordered the Cheese Curds as an appetizer my gf ordered the Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese and I had the Ribeye Steak sandwich We both had two drinks with our dinner Cheese curds came before the meal and they turned out to be pretty good Nothing to rave about but average At last our meal was delivered The bun for my Ribeye sandwich turned out to be what looked like Texas toast As I peeled back the bread to look at my sandwich I was in for a huge let down This was the absolute worst excuse for a ribeye steak sandwich My biggest complaint it was paper thin PAPER THIN Literately speaking my steak was no thicker than a cardboard coaster The price tag on this steak sandwich was 10 This is my biggest pet peeves when it comes to steak sandwiches I don t mind paying upwards of 15 for a steak sandwich but I expect good quality This was such a poor excuse for ribeye I had to eat it with the top piece of toast off just to taste the meat How dare they insult their customers with such a poor excuse for a steak sandwich My gf equally hated her grilled cheese for reasons she will explain in her own review Once the check arrived 52 we asked to speak with the manager We both expressed our concerns with Andy the manager We felt like after spending 50 we should leave the restaurant full and satisfied Instead we were leaving hungry miserable and downright insulted Andy rattled off various reason as to why my steak might have been a little on the thin side He apologized for the size of the steak and offered us 2 free drinks to make up for our poor experience REALLY We spent over 50 and all he was going to do was give us two free drinks No thanks We refused the free drinks and made sure he knew he just lost two customers for good I m not looking for a handout I m not looking for my money back but the way he handled our situation was horrible If a customer spends 50 in your restaurant and absolutely hated the food two drinks is not enough to make up for this I expected a credit or a gift card to come back and give Seven Saints another chance Now I will never be back I can find steak sandwiches comparable to the one I had at Seven Saints at Taffies or Steak n Shake Keep your two free drinks Just know we will spread the word to anyone who will listen I hope you handle future situations better 
2UuPd_qoH2O0mW_G-dBezw CMU DO NOT go here if you are looking for some chrome and glass ubermodern quail egg topped with scallion serving trying too hard to be trendy cafe DO go here if you are looking for decent Midwestern breakfast served in a cozy albeit kitschy venue for a decent price Woo for 1 Yummy biscuits that are an option instead of toast 2 Tasty sounding pancake options including the special that day pumpkin 3 A place that I can get an old fashioned chocolate soda Hellllooooo Boo for 1 A waitress who mistook my coffee order I got regular instead of the cinnamon almond which was the special 2 A waitress who slops coffee all over the table when setting down our mugs and then never cleans it up but clearly eyeballs the running liquid several times when passing by 3 Regular coffee that was so weak it looked like broth when I added a dollop of cream 4 Cold hash browns not that I had room to eat them anyway I was assured that the service is usually much better and more friendly I guess they were caught off guard with the rush of Dad s Weekend Menu options were enticing so I ll be back 
2vLFhsiRTlYH0gtbAAVy_w CMU I m a little too young to remember this place as R R s and I had stopped working here by the time they brought the shark bowl back but I was one of the first employees of this place when it reopened FINALLY as Firehaus in 05 This bar took a long time to get on its feet and by then I was tired of not making any money due to lack of clientle so I had moved on But now it s kicking ass and taking names and has a whole lot of loyal customers and for that I give this bar all sorts of props Also I just said props Ew Anyway the really excellent thing about this bar is that it is CLEAN Clean clean clean Even on Unofficial which is arguably the dirtiest day on campus all year the bathrooms at Firehaus will be clean The layout isn t my favorite as there aren t a whole lot of places to sit but the beer garden is excellent and the buffalo chicken sandwich with pasta salad was pretty damned good Of all the Cochrane bars on campus this one is without a doubt the best 
2vvB41Zwx03u0F44sgy_8w CMU If you re too lazy to read my novel no judgment here is a summary Seven Saints awesome I m sure you ve seen a lot of 5 star reviews on Yelp and thought to yourself this person s 5 star is probably a 3 in my book so I think you need a little back story to understand just how hard it is to score the coveted 5 red stars in my book I m high maintenance I m also spoiled I m from California where there are actually more than six places to choose from for cocktails and late night dining It s not that I don t love quaint little Champaign Urbana but if a place doesn t live up to your expectations there are not many other options to choose from Ask any of my friends they heard me complain about this for months when I first moved here over three years ago Then I found Seven Saints This place excels in everything I look for customer service quality product and environment As you can see from the pictures the ambiance is warm intimate and inviting The seating and decor create an environment that is perfect for enjoying time with a date group of friends coworkers and even people you don t really like but are forced to hang out with once in a while Their menu has what I like to think of as fancy versions of classic Midwestern treats They are famous for their sliders try the Black Jack Slider come back here and thank me Or go for the hat trick and add on the Salmon Slider and California Turkey Slider and thank me three times The lovely waitresses waiters are always friendly and attentive It s amazing how they stay on top of tables orders when it gets busy As for drinks I m just starting to learn about beer and they have a wide selection to choose from Tuesdays they have beer specials which is a great time to sample things I wouldn t normally order And now for my favorite part Whiskey Wednesday I ve waited over two years to write this review because I treated Whiskey Wednesday like Fight Club it s so awesome you aren t supposed to talk about it The guilt has pushed me and I feel it is now time to let those of you who don t know in on this marvelous secret every Wednesday they feature 50 off their whiskey menu That s right This isn t a fake out Miko s 50 off either This is an unbelievable selection of quality whiskeys from around the world for half the price They rotate weeks from North American Irish Bourbon and Scotch in addition to weekly featured bottles I m not cool enough to call myself a whiskey connoisseur but I am very stuck up about my whiskey The two Whiskey Wednesday bartenders are amazing and are always able to find new and exciting things for me behind the bar They REALLY know their stuff Try it Go in and pick any whiskey off the menu They can tell you about the grain barrels aging process blend everything I can t even remember what I had for lunch yesterday They are extremely helpful and know the full range of whiskey flavors I ve been in many times with friends who don t drink whiskey often or are just starting out and want to go easy It doesn t matter how experienced you are the Whiskey Wednesday boys will take care of you Andy is the general manager and I can never say too many good things about him At most other restaurants you ll see the manager walking around to check things out but that s about it Andy introduces himself and actually talks to the customers He is always around to make sure people have a good experience It s a pleasure to listen to him tell you about the history behind a specific bottle or cocktail If you ve seen him on the CBS morning show you can tell how passionate he is about what he does So yes I just gushed about Seven Saints but I mean every word of it The quality products excellent customer service are enough to satisfy this high maintenance Californian I m also narcissistic enough to believe you ll actually come back on here to thank me Seriously Go check them out I ll see you again soon 
3csMOXAC_wj9y3nsFkvJfg CMU This place seemed to be the fun college hang out bar The place where the frat boys come to hang out and scan the ladies up and down I am not a frat boy I did not come here to hit on ladies I felt old here Though the bartender was nice and offered some suggestions to my friend on where he could meet some ladies to hook up with Mercifully I got to go back to the hotel and get myself to bed 
3gD1EdYsfWnGq4aC5eVnQw CMU Good burgers good beer Need more 
3OPH1y8FyocdbG1ZtzTKbA CMU This is a nice little place Nice staff cool decor I ordered the goat cheese salad spring greens grapes strawberries goat cheese sweet roasted walnuts and fruity vinaigrette and a salmon slider The food was decent Loved the salad but might not get the salmon again as the flavors just didn t work for me However they do substitute boca patties on any of the other sliders for 0 50 extra so I might try that next time What I really like about this place is the strong drinks Two drinks and I had a nice buzz and I m normally not a two drink lady The signature cocktails listed on their menu are pricey but I ordered a Tom Collins not on the menu and it was 3 50 which is pretty good in my book 
3uS7fZyyd2ids3IcJYs-bA CMU As an Urbana native I grew up going to this place I have always been satisfied and often recommend this to anyone new to the area I really suggest going here and getting any number of the dishes as they are all great The salad bar has a wide range of options which makes it one of the best in town Leave room for dessert The Misprint is definitely worth it 
3vBV0zNu76ZFbOSIPnSA3Q CMU Lots of comfort food at this local favorite The food unfortunately is not as good as it used to be and they crowd a few too many tables in the dining room It s almost a three star but since they ve taken such good care of me all these years and the service is good it s still a winner in my book Shakes burgers and sandwiches and a nice little salad bar The breakfast however is the reason to come It used to be the Courier newspaper so there are historic artifacts from the old days 
3YZbyoRf5LfUn2yLhWQm4Q CMU We went to get lunch here on a Saturday afternoon Waited for about 15 20 minutes for a table VERY cramped waiting area Menu had a lot of options I went with the Monkey Stuff sandwich this sweet delectable sandwich of tasty sugary goodness This sandwich would have been way better had the bread been toasted By the end I just felt like I was eating a mush of sugar To counteract this sugar I also ordered from the salad bar I liked the layout of the Salad Bar you pay 0 38 per oz of salad you get so I had a filling salad to go with my sweet sandwich for only 2 50 Not a very diverse salad bar but I was fairly pleased The other members of my party enjoyed their meal just fine but we didn t feel this was anything special The decor of the restaurant is very vintage so it s kind of dark and has a different feel to it After reading the reviews I m bummed I didn t order a milkshake I don t know that we d necessarily make a special trip to come back here 
4EmXA_YGzYQOWL21BNDQdg CMU It s ALL about the peanut butter and chocolate milkshake I usually get the reuben sandwich or an omelet but it s really the milkshake that keeps me coming back 
4gCjQXxxwp9Dm2KkmZ7P5A CMU I m a little bias about this place since my Great Grandfather and Great Great Grandfather owned this place when it was a newspaper and printing business The building has a lot of nostalgia for me So the atmosphere is awesome especially knowing relatives had spent so much time in it and keeps its old charm The restaurant owners have done a nice job keeping the historic feel while not going tacky We were there for breakfast I ve heard lunch and dinner are so so Our breakfasts were all very good fresh tasty and good portions Nothing that makes you call it the best you ever had but great basic food nonetheless I ll go back for breakfast at the Courier next time I m in town Have to say the service was outstanding super friendly fast unobtrusive Go give the Courier a try and say hi to the ghosts for me 
4sQYYZehT9UjdaiD5ZUUTw CMU Wow Pickles is great Once a year when you are tired of getting your grad student snobbery on at koFusion or where ever and need a near lethal injection of kitsch When I went it was still decorated for christmas and they had metallic green pickle ornaments hanging on fake trees and drawings of pickles trimming a christmas tree on the specials white board And it is not ironic These people are serious My burger was palatable my fries were much better and they did have heineken Also a side of the day Today it was macaroni salad Wow Unfortunate note though all our entrees WERE served with pickles they were terrible 
5-sDKaXxUhyY49zARj-jpw CMU Loved the style and ambiance of the place Very laid back but classy as well The waiter was so nice and answered any and all questions I had about the very very large liquor menu My husband and I got the 1 2 salad 1 2 soup option which is a very nice price The vegetable soup was very hardy and our salads were delicious Would definitely go back if I lived nearby 
5ayVt7M8wQ84x3_yEPl7fQ CMU Ate here on a whim one night when Black Dog Smoke House was packed and really enjoyed it I ve been here three times now with different people Best piece of advice for ordering food avoid the pastas get the burgers mezzo plate or tacos when on special The pastas I ve had or others with me have had were not that great but the pub food is interesting and done right Plus you cannot beat the beer selection and their prices are fair Service is always fast even if they re crowded 
5i_T0kGqMirF-9rX_-Ft9Q CMU tried breakfast and it gets an extra star It s worth the wait for breakfast pancakes are good 
5llEuzO5aB4fBnG_Ekfe9Q CMU I had lunch with a friend at Crane Alley yesterday I d never been there but had heard mostly good things I m going to agree with that assessment mostly good I had the portobello sandwich with peppers and a nice pesto topping I was sort of disappointed when my friend said she wasn t into beet chips as an appetizer but completely excited when I saw I could substitute my fries for beet chips Yay We ended up sharing the spinach and artichoke dip app It came with toasted pita slices Mmmmm The food was interesting and it was good It wasn t fantastic or mind blowing but it was solid and the menu had a good variety of selections The price wasn t super cheap but it wasn t outrageous for lunch My sandwich plus beet chips which do carry a surcharge as a substitution my friend s entree a bowl of the soup of the day and a Reuben one soft drink and our appetizer 28 79 before tip The drink menu is HUGE I d love to come back for dinner and drinks sometime The ambiance screams You re in a bar which considering that hey you re in a bar that works It was cozy the lighting was low the booths black might be a nice place for a casual date The one aspect that shone above all was the service Our waiter was FANTASTIC He was knowledgeable about the menu helpful without being pushy or overbearing very attentive we had regular drink refills but he didn t make it hard for us to continue our conversation He even brought us an assortment of to go containers so we could keep the dip and pita chips separate what a guy That waiter deserves five stars and a large tip 
5rQ84gD_5QSHyLeswD5xXw CMU This place used to be my favorite place in Urbana followed closely by the Office Well now the Office is closed and I feel like Crane Alley is shell of what it used to be In fact I never go out in Urbana anymore One star for serving food all night and one star for never being too crowded and loud If I only have expectations to hang out with friends at night I m not disappointed I loved the food about 3 6 years ago but recently the food quality has declined and the service is horrible We met up with friends there they had been there for about an hour Let s just say we got our food before their order was taken We were at adjacent tables outside At lunchtime Bad Why the third star This is where my boyfriend and I went on our first date over three years ago Obviously it was a good date 
61yiMDVnDZeWLYqid7V3bg CMU Gone down hill I used to love their sliders and salads but the service here is atrocious The latest time I tried to go we sat down and proceeded to be ignored for 30 minutes even as the servers saw us Finally someone said they would get to us but 10 minutes later we just left Oh and this was a Monday night It s worse on weekends 
6AqLo79vRMSnNom6WnEExg CMU This place never fails me for a good time I would say when I m in Chambana 70 of the year this is my default location You can find me here for lunch dates with my bff for their fried chicken salad with blue cheese and a side of their homemade fries mmm so delicious Recently they have introduced 4 40 s which I pray they will continue through the school year not just the summer The balcony is always nice on a summer evening Of course this place gets packed what campus bar doesn t But if I had to pick a bar to wait in line for it d be this one 
6H-3ULf-wYoTngi-GeWfRA CMU Seven saints has a good atmosphere and decent food Always order the cheese curds Their sliders are good but maybe a tad pricey I used to be a fan of the black and blue salad but its been steadily getting worse over time They have a good selection of beer Anyway it beats out all the campus town bars but for down town champaign its ok I come here for burgers and beer When I just want good beer i go down the street 
6ltBvcczBlPD1TGFlu78zg CMU I give Fat City Saloon five stars because they are excellent at what the strive to be A saloon The menu consists of simple classic pub food that has been prepared exceptionally well They don t offer anything fancy but they use high quality ingredients and prepare it competently On Fridays they offer a beer battered fish sandwich that simply has to be tasted to be believed I would walk a mile on my lips for one of their fish sandwiches and would love to see it on the regular menu Skip s grilled cheese is another favorite but don t expect the kids classic sandwich as this is a grown up version with three kinds of cheese tomatoes and bacon The service is extremely friendly and generally quite competent Another reviewer reported some bad experiences with service on the two occasions on which he had visited but I ve had nothing but exemplary and friendly service and I ve been going there regularly for many years both before they closed and again after they re opened I will routinely order carry out lunch with a group of friends and yes there have been some minor mix ups on our order But we order from a lot of different places for carry out or delivery and they have done better than every other restaurant in town in accuracy and we typically order anywhere from 4 12 entrees On those rare occasions when something was messed up they corrected it immediately cheerfully and then didn t charge for the messed up orders ALL restaurants have bad days when everything seems to go wrong and they handle theirs better than most They have a well stocked bar and an excellent beer list I don t drink wine all that often any more so I keep forgetting to check out the wine list I don t go to Fat City to drink or hang out but when I ve stayed there to eat the sound system has been perfectly fine Also the restrooms are clean and well lit I ve never had to wait for a drink and when I m drinking iced tea or soda my glass has never been allowed to hit empty before I get a free refill I frequently go to Fat City for lunch often making a separate trip from Mahomet where I live just to eat there As the name would imply I wouldn t go there if I were on a strict low fat diet but if you want excellent no frills pub food this place is awesome 
6wnetgLM__NCbrMmbBdWdw CMU I generally agree with what everyone else said The only reason I go to Guido s is the food HELLOOOOO nachos and quesadillas and maaaaaybe for a beer during the daytime because they have a big patio on a prime corner of downtown However I will NOT go here at night because one word can describe this place douche baggery It s basically a bunch of frat bros sorostitues Jersey Shore wannabes 30 something townies that think they re still as cool as they were in high school and still hanging out with their circle of obnoxious high school friends It s always so jam packed with these annoying packs of people that it s impossible to get a drink or even make your way from one side of the bar to the other I think I ve gotten in some sort of verbal altercation with some 21 year old sorority ho almost every time I ve been here for either sloshing a drink on me or running into me in a drunken stuper Oh Guido s why do you have to draw all the douchebags out of the woodwork Alas it gets 3 stars because I like the food 
71rvUxBxIV5oJlh-bmzHOA CMU A star for the delcious salad bar A star for the shakes and soda fountain A star for the yummy veg options and a star for huge delicious burgers One of my favorite places to eat in CU If the service was better I would ve given the place 5 stars 
74ULtb8pljHtvIgQFFjxQg CMU I was back in town a month ago or so and we went out to Crane Alley I saw someone else posted something I felt that night they expect you to stay in your assigned seats I definitely noticed that From now on I will only go later on at night when there aren t so many groups out Still awesome beer selection and bartenders 
79c9JPMDuKyaSwgGC7F3ng CMU This place couldn t be any better My boyfriend and I went today for lunch I got the turkey slider and the Cajun bean and rice soup while he also got the turkey slider and the 7 saints salad We sat outside and it was a gorgeous day our waitress was really helpful and it was so hard to choose what to order We both agreed that we could eat here everyday for a month and be happy His salad was unbelievable the sesame dressing was mouth watering I m from Chicago just visiting here but I would come back just for the turkey sliders If you eat you have to go here 
7Bqs2IPQNyD23k5Y6EfjNA CMU The food here was ok The cheese curds were awesome The batter on them are light and the cheese itself is a big hunk I ordered the black and blue salad which was ok I was expecting a variety of greens but it was just lettuce The sweet potato fries were excellent Service was good fast and friendly I d go back for the fries and cheese curds 
7BXxeWiaDo76lRaY1gnI7w CMU Delicious for breakfast lunch and dinner Friendly waitstaff quick service good food and seriously delicious shakes and phosphates I couldn t tell you what flavor Green River is but man it is soooo good We always go here when we re craving a big burger And skinny dippers 
7E6B-oKVtXp5Gi46nkfOyQ CMU Courier is solid Come for the breakfast food and if you re in need of a reliable lunch you should go to Courier as well It s nothing adventurous eggs and bacon pancakes and tuna salad on white bread But it s tasty reasonably priced and friendly It gets busy on weekends 
7FQZisE56TWl7oBU_W4P9w CMU This place is a little expensive when you consider the following 1 The service is atrocious 2 they stop making a lot of the food early I like to go from time to time for London Broil it tastes great But if I arrive a little late but still within the time that the place is open I might not get the food I came for They stop cooking the food eve though people have still paid to be there The staff has been rude and slow for as long as I have been coming It s embarrassing when you bring people from out of town like visiting lecturers etc Three stars for good food minus two stars for being lazy and rude 
7pHrQHG11LClKLNCEj2VYA CMU I really enjoy going to Seven Saints when I m in town They ve got a crazy selection of alcohol and at quite reasonable prices at least the gin The sliders are quite tasty I had the salmon one which was definitely good and I also got the BBQ which was as good as I had it on my previous visit I believe on my first visit I also got the one with the pineapple and that was kinda wacky but still really tasty 
7pj2azNWbMcflq-p58kFVg CMU Over the years I ve watched while the prices have risen steadily including a very sharp increase right about the time Jimmy John started building that obscene house of his Hmmmmm I wonder if there s a connection Meanwhile quality and quantity of ingredients has declined substantially What was once my favorite place to grab a sandwich isn t even on my list anymore Kinda sad I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer who complained about the avocado The most insulting part of it is that they charge something ridiculous like 1 00 a huge amount when compared to the total cost of the sandwich to add extra avocado In my experience even if you pay for extra there s still not enough on there to actually taste it Paradiso is located in the same building as the JJ s on Lincoln and is a MUCH better sandwich for about the same price I d recommend going there instead 
7xfgINDcbo4vp_WhOVA4rQ CMU The Boy and I came here because we saw a Capital Brewery sign floating in the window like a neon beacon of hope and happiness We sat at the bar and perused the beer list Sadly the only Capital beer they had came in the form of cans of the Island Wheat Ew and oh no Fortunately the rest of the beer list was fairly extensive and diverse But what s this Cheese curds Oh Seven Saints You have cut to the core of this simple Wisconsin girl So we ordered the cheese curds a Rogue Dead Guy Ale and an Anchor Steam solid beer choices if you re in the market The cheese curds were not cheese curds they were palm sized balls of mozzarella with a light gooey breading on them And they came with a delicious marinara sauce Let me tell you something These curds are not f n around They are formidable We couldn t finish them they were so heavy How is it that Illinois managed to out fat bastard Wisconsin Go figure Seven Saints is a very pretty bar at least at night All espresso dark wood and nice lighting And the jukebox was interesting When we first got in there the crowd all seemed slightly older so it was very odd that some new hip hop hump dancey song was bumping over the stereo Swiftly and even more randomly the jukebox changed over to super hits of my early adolescence Blind Melon Spin Doctors and even some Van Halen I was okay with this if not a little more than amused When it comes right down to it we all know I m coming back 
83HOHZL88hGs4FhEQvZq9w CMU barf barf barf one of my worst dining experiences ever now i realize this is a towny joint in champaign il and believe me im keeping that in mind when im hating on this place but it was horrible the food was gross not even just subpar and i mean its a simple menu how do you mess up things like burgers fries and chicken and the wait staff unbelievable just dont go 
85OwlISte36wwvuz2ZcPdQ CMU In my travels across the nation this is my favorite breakfast spot Their variety of fresh made in house breads which they use to make all toasts and their most amazing Almond French Toast their crisp hash browns made from fresh grated potatoes their corned beef hash which is unlike any I have ever had because of the way they incorporate fresh mushrooms sauteed into real corned beef their fresh fruit infused made from scratch pancakes their egg white ChaCha Charito their unlimited fresh ground coffee I wish there were Courier Cafes in every state because they set the gold standard for Fresh and Real breakfast food Freshness is everything 
8IL8SwrBoLXS5nggZglUhw CMU For a bar that serves several variations on the slider Seven Saints is decent Per slider the prices are reasonable and the variety is notable On a recent visit my boyfriend and I tried the bacon and cheese and the classic cheeseburger sliders as well as the buffalo chicken wing slider The buffalo wing reminded me that I have never liked those in any form but I liked the other two The bacon was thin and perfectly crisp and neither of my sliders were overwhelmed by too much cheese We also ordered the beet chips which are presented in a dramatic pile I thought they were great though I would have liked options for dipping other than the goat cheese dip My boyfriend was ambivalent about the beet chips but he still ate more than half of them Seven Saints has a nice combination menu and we availed ourselves of the soup and slider option and tried the tomato bisque which had a nice flavor and texture We tried to order samples of both of the night s soups the other option was beer cheese but the kitchen was not interested in accommodating that request so we just took a chance on the tomato The beer and wine list here is lengthy though they have many more beers by the bottle than on tap and what they have on tap isn t that interesting We arrived for dinner at about 7 30 on a Thursday night It was busy but there wasn t a wait and our server was efficient and genuinely nice This isn t going to be a regular destination for me by any stretch but I enjoyed my sliders and would return if I had a craving 
8uQmwvQzMeIzDziw4OBdWw CMU Best place in Central Illinois for beer selection Cannot be topped Solid food too but the real reason to go here is if one covets craft brews Staff are friendly as hell bartenders knowledgeable and prices aren t too bad Thumbs up A must hit for connoisseurs 
8VBSAS-NqgTNE2jicIlUww CMU The ballroom as the name suggests provides a grand atmosphere for lunch But the food is done by University Dining Services the same people that cater meetings and events so badly The motto could be A dorm dining hall without the dorm The one joy of the buffet line for me is its Midwestern ness I occasionally see jello salads and ambrosia unlike anything I have ever seen on the West Coast Miniature marshmallows Fruit salad with is that mayonnaise The salad and dessert recipes recall the Better Homes cookbook circa 1952 But beyond these culture shocks there is little pleasure to be found It s expensive for the quality of the food The salad bar is tolerable The main dishes range from poor to horrible The sandwich bar features limp lunchmeats and tasteless bread If you like to snicker at such things apparently the person who writes the buffet cards is often stumped by the exotic ingredients in some dishes This leads to platters marked as White Soup Spring Salad or my favorite Ethnic Dish Note that the previous price listed is out of date It is now 8 75 for buffet drink and dessert 
9-fnfd7o88x6o_61fSjnSQ CMU I am soooo torn in writing this review right now So let s break it down into two visits one nightlife related one evening food related Nightlife I came here for a friend s 21st and waited for an hour until 145 a m yes 15 min before close when I just said f k it and left with my friends Honestly what is the point of maintaining the line that close to closing when the bar itself is not at capacity Evening We came here at the end of Fall semester as an organization to celebrate a job well done Our group of 10 was seated promptly and the waitress did an awesome job in accommodating our group We came on a Thursday I think which meant 3 burger with AMAZINGGGGGG fries Their fries are double fried so they have a great crispy crust On top of that they have a good selection of beer on tap to complement your meal Expect to pay more for a pint than for your entire meal haha So it s quite bittersweet awesome bar food place turned horrible bar at night This is life 
9CTtZUviGCpV6xPDXovreA CMU You know I actually like Rock s Especially in the summer when it s not too crowded and the outdoor seating is available It s a bar it s clean and it probably has the best nachos in cu last night I ate two portions which is embarrassing because thy are HUGE 
9dNoSQ2XXrC8lnTNacX5zQ CMU It seems like a Guido s wannabe meaning the decor is nice and could be posh Not so many people frequent there unfortunately So it s not a trendy place as of now It s an okay place I don t really like any of their specialty drinks I tried the Jamiebull not enough Redbull or Jameson and the Lemon Shakeup too sweet I have tried their sliders which is like a mini burger they are decent but they aren t terribly big and kind of pricey if you get three of them which is equivalent to one burger I haven t had any outstanding salads here either unfortunately I would try it if you want a change in scenery from Guido s and Boltini s 
9foThw9fadR_HHN75CEXmg CMU the service has always been good when i ve been there i even once walked there with my husband and our young son in a stroller they were awesome enough to accommodate our larger than life stroller in another room while we dined with our progeny no dirty looks about the baby stroller just awesomeness as they stowed it away in another room that gets a star all by itself the beer selection is top notch so if you re into that you re covered if you like cheese products deep fried and dipped in crazy fattening ranch dressing you re also in luck apparently it s great i ve never eaten it but i ve heard tell the sliders are okay not great not bad just okay i get the vegetarian burger it s meh i can heat up a griller patty in the microwave at home and put it on a tiny bun for all of about 1 25 i understand that businesses have to make money but at least make me feel like i m getting something new and exciting for the price this place would get a solid two stars from me if not for the amazing decadent brown sugar oatmeal cake i don t eat sugar often but when i do it s this place for THAT cake holy hell it s terrible for you and it s worth every penny 
9OfUwxfKOu3vm7hK3bpTVA CMU Some of the best burgers in town They also have seasonal weekly items that are prepared using local produce Other menu items are delicious and reasonably priced Beer selection us decent Only negative would be it can usually be loud but that is to be expected in a good location 
a0BNvmsJz5O71eP81jWOZw CMU i d give this place 5 stars but there s this dude named stern who always goes there JEEZUZ 
a1kdk2jQvltCGvz7ksXV5Q CMU Cheap drinks a melting pot of patrons and the best deep fryer in town what s not to like 
A1N_EkONZCLYX62Y2KpLSQ CMU I tried their shrimp pasta it was bland and had a weird taste The service was a little slow but friendly The portions are good but for the price I hoped the taste would have been a little more pleasing 
ABCy1adJ4gGpJArrOMPXGg CMU We found this place based on several previous Yelp reviews We were not disappointed The building that this cafe is in was apparently the former home of the Urbana Courier newspaper It is decorated in late 1800 s early 1900 s decor The antiques in this place are worth a visit on their own There is a 1920 s mechanical gumball machine that is well worth the 25 cent price The waitress was full of energy and very friendly She paid special attention to my daughter which I love from any server as long as they are not weird men I started with a Two Brothers Domaine DuPage draft 4 00 It was delicious kind of sweet with just a hint of hoppiness I ordered the The Famous Courier Reuben 7 95 The corned beef on this was so tender it practically chewed itself The sauerkraut add just the right hint of bitterness The grilled rye bread was perfect I topped it with what tasted like homemade Thousand Island dressing and horseradish This sandwich was big I was stuffed after finishing it I opted for no sides with this I shared some of my wife s sweet potato chips They were crisp but seemed to be lacking of any real substance I ended the meal with a hand dipped chocolate milkshake 3 75 It was creamy cool and refreshing The perfect ending to this outstanding meal This place will definitely be in our Yelp bookmarks We will be back 
ACCynll4hjozFcWzpISZ5g CMU BEST BLACKBEAN BURGER EVER IN MY LIFE i miss crane alley it was my go to restaurant in the CU area always blackbean burger no sprouts with a side of greek pasta salad even better with a bloody mary or a spicy martini there s a specific one that i m talking about but i can t remember what it s called they also have an AMAZING beer selection every time i go there are a few new draft beers definitely try a beer flight oh and the sweet potato fries so goooooddddd i ve tried a few other items on the menu but after finding the blackbean burger there was never a reason to order anything else SERIOUSLY THE BEST EVER 5 million stars 
afabIm86eXeNri_NtrfWZw CMU I have been to this TGIF at least 10 times with my wife and I will be coming back The waiters are always attentive the food is really delicious especially their sirloins The prices are also very reasonable I like the atmosphere of this restaurant a lot and the wall decorations are very cool I would recommend it to my friends 
AJcczlH00FQjLdTgd3TqBA CMU Bunny s is a weekly spot for me for lunch The lunch fare is very reasonably priced the place is packed but quick and the help is very friendly and accomodating Their cheesburger might be the best in town under 5 bucks and you can load it up with lettuce tomato and the usual condiments including a pickle slice Hidden off of Main Street it has a collection of regulars on the bar stools drinking beer but I would not hesitate to bring a child or senior citizen in for a sandwich One TV is likely to have a Cubs game playing and the other TV might have CNN This is a hangout for courthouse employees and City of Urbana staff as well as the crowd that works in downtown Urbana 
AOED8K_oD4VZOUp1VlqZgg CMU Crane Alley is wonderful They have a very extensive beer list friendly staff yummy food pool tables and a great beer garden in the adjacent alley Crane alley is a good place for after work cocktails lunch dinner and just hangin out The Fine Young Cannibal reccomends the beet chips and black bean burger 
aoXVw5su5ZORXUpBmYS8TA CMU I ve been here a few times and all the earlier ones were pretty good but this last time was just horrible I went here on a Saturday with a group of 12 We got there around 8pm I knew this place was usually busy but when we put our name in they said it would take 30 minutes So we figured we would wait since we had not been there in a long time After an hour of waiting they were able to seat 6 people The other 6 had to wait for an adjacent table to open up It did not open up for another 30 minutes So I was just really confused on how they would tell us it would take 30 minutes when really it took 1 hour and 30 minutes The first half of our group had already ordered for us in an attempt to save some time since everyone was starving After we were seated it took about 10 minutes for our server to come ask us what we wanted to drink and then another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks The food was alright I usually get different sliders but decided to try the steak sandwich It was pretty good a little messy though since there was a ton of oil that came with it After we finished the guy took all of our plates and then it took 10 minutes for him to ask us if we were ready for the check then it took him another 10 minutes to get us the check And then another 10 minutes to charge all the cards That was one of the worst dining experiences I ve had Over 2 hours of just waiting for things You would think that with a larger group he would have paid more attention to us but guess it doesn t work that way Like I said earlier I ve been here before and they were ok experiences which accounts for the 2nd star But we ll see if I ever go back in the near future Just pissed that we waited so long when the server kept saying it would be 5 10 more minutes every time we asked 
ApACqLsFty1QZmmeN26tIw CMU I honestly got all my friends to go here I went here for a friends birthday and FELL IN LOVE with their food I ALWAYS get the grilled chicken slider with their honey mustard for dipping and their asian salad it is seriously to die for yummy We always get a plate of cheese curds for the table since we can t resist For the many times I ve made a decision to go back to Champaign for a visit I ll admit dining at Seven Saints has always heavily swayed my decision towards making the trip 
apaqWkl5ft2vDgC--z_kLw CMU Went there for breakfast by myself one Saturday morning My waitress was accomodating and the food arrived timely It was a giant Spanish Omelet and was delicious The breakfast menu is not as extensive as Sammy s but there were good choices Returned another Saturday morning with my daughters and three year old granddaughter The waitress was very friendly and helpful interacting nicely with my granddaughter Everyone ordered something different and all the portions were large and delicious Great value for the reasonable cost I have had breakfast there often in the past and always enjoyed the food and service This is definitely a favorite 
apF7plyBBXqxA7J0-nOGCA CMU I want to like this place more because the service is good and the space itself is inviting I like BEING here but the food is mediocre The burgers are mealy and taste more like seasoning than meat Nothing I ve had here is remarkable and I ve been lots of times since it s a great place to meet up with friends and drink 
askGRw7_bnZ4xOlBHVClJg CMU Some things never change The Courier Cafe is one of them I lived down here in C U about 6 years ago and just moved back down here about a month ago One of my friends suggested that we get a bite to eat here before checking out a play at the Station Theatre I said sure why not haven t been there in ages Anyway the service was great The pay as you go salad bar was reasonably priced and well stocked I ordered a quesadilla which was good but not great and my friend had a buffalo chicken wrap that was also good but not great There was nothing wrong with the food or service but besides the cute ambience there s nothing special about this place I hear the milkshakes are amazing though 
as_cuEXYJcbsEsOw8rX9oQ CMU Excellent place for lunch I work across Krannert and this is convenient I love their veggie chili 
AZWR9LLbvzNeFeK2FhGPtg CMU You will not find hoards of undergraduates here it might even be hard to find more than a few grad students And yet it has one of the best beer selections in town a restaurant and 4 full sized pool tables Drinking beer and playing pool is probably one of my favorite ways to hang out and this is the perfect place for it I don t know if I should let this get out much but wednesday is half off pool night I played with 3 other people last week for a couple of hours and they charged us only 1 50 each That s ridiculous It s also not loud at all for a bar they have outdoor seating in the alley when it s warm and the background music is usually a pleasant mix of classic rock About the restaurant don t go here during off hours not dinner I don t think the regular kitchen is working or something is off I wish they had a few cheaper more suited to a bar kind of appetizers than they do especially since their above average overall food quality would make fantastic late night snacks The guyfriends manage and are usually hungry enough to eat entire sandwiches and meals by the end of the night so they don t complain 
B6eA2orOBcd4y8aGqp1FRw CMU I ve read the other reviews for this place but cannot imagine why our experience was so different from what others have described I think I d rather eat junk from a vending machine next time We had a BLT I ve never before had a BLT that used diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce At least nothing about the sandwich was actually horrible but when talking about a sandwich that should be as simple to do well as a BLT being mediocre and the best part of a meal We also had the Chili served in a bread bowl It was thick and gummy reminding me of Hormel s canned product blech For sides we had the Three Bean Salad I don t think I ve ever had a three bean salad that featured bits of broccoli or some kind of mysterious yellow disk vegetable Other than mysterious extra ingredients I do not recall it being particularly horrid but it certainly was not something I d order again We also had the Potato Salad which was decent but kinda sweet The Iced Tea a fright with a very industrial taste Vying for best part of the meal with the mediocre BLT were the Oyster Crackers that came with the Chili They were made by Nabisco not my favorite brand but they were fresh 
BaSX6tUSMVyAbacYJS2jKw CMU This is a nice townie dive bar in the middle of Urbana sort of hidden away Lunch is cheap beers are cheap and the service is friendly Great place to have a beer on a normal weeknight or early weekend evening That said don t bring a woman on a weekend night Unless you want them to be disrespected have their ass pinched etc The crowd here moves toward the sleezy side at some point on weekend nights 
bbssavRf84smaS0q0zsJWA CMU Good breakfast joint right in downtown Urbana 
BI2plWJMCZCceguIHC2DZQ CMU I definitely love this place The food is amazing no matter if you get a salad or a slider or both The service is always friendly and food never takes to long I plan on coming here a lot more often now that I m 21 and can actually drink with my meal 
BJE1KUlDK3c9aD1QT4djXw CMU I have been here too many times to count I have never left anything other than happy though eating pretty good and relatively cheap food tends to do that to me I was holding off on yelping this place as it has been done to death and I don t have much to say other than 1 I suggest you try the phosphates old fashioned soda pop 2 they reportedly have good hangover treatment burgers 3 their salad bar is pretty darn good 4 you should sit in the front not the back and 5 if both price and ambiance is important to you this is one of the best places to eat in Urbana especially for breakfast I guess I did have a lot to say 
bjw6RhL355sldCKmQ9A7QA CMU The food was good I ordered a slider half a salad and a raspberry iced tea First off their servings are TINY compared to the price Was tempted to get two sliders but stuck with one and now am very hungry Good slider though Not greasy lightly toasted bun crunchy bacon and tender burger The salad I got country fried chicken was AMAZING Their honey mustard dressing is light and tangy I loved the many julienned red onion and cucumber and half cherry tomaotes By far my favorite part of the meal Now The iced tea Nuh uh Is NOT raspberry flavored Very small cup for the price I stole my sister s sweet potato fries and eh Guido s has better Seven Saint s fries are overly crunchy and weirdly shaped My friend said the beer selection though large didn t have what he really wanted Also he said the Seven Saint s salad is a little offputting The lime and nut and fruit combo did not a salad make The actual restaurant was pretty nice Clean tables The barstools weren t uncomfortably high The service was nice but slow The server forgot my friend s beer and was late with the drinks but was very cheerful and helpful My sister said the bathrooms were passable Probably will come back but will remember to get at least two sliders and a dinner sized salad 
boIV7cIceTpjn11uqoInRA CMU I went here for breakfast and we got seated for two right away The waitress was super nice The food I have to say was just average Maybe I had talked it up in my head too much I had been craving french toast all week and this Sunday breakfast was supposed to satisfy that craving and it did not do it I ordered the almond french toast with cinnamon raisin bread as suggested from our waitress I had a side of the sweet maple links eh and hash browns And it was just average I could have been eating at Denny s or any other diner The ambiance is TOTALLY cute though I would definitely be willing to try breakfast here again maybe the pancakes are better 
BtPw4hnn03pnDEUV72w-FQ CMU Seven Saints is hands down my favorite place to go in Champaign It has the perfect atmosphere to enjoy a night with great food esp the buffalo chicken sliders and cheese curds an amazing spirits list with tons of awesome and very very affordably priced whiskies and a relaxed comfortable feel Andy is an exceptional general manager who takes clear interest in creating a positive personal experience for the customers and the service is exceptional That s not even to mention the AMAZING 50 off whiskeys every Wednesday night I can t say enough about how great this place is 
c3c5aeqd5-FBJLxm3MCOCw CMU I really like this place that I go nearly every weekend when I am in town They used to have really hot waitresses so my guy friends would make me go all the time There is no cover no lines busy and it s a posh place to hang out on the weekends It s supposed to be a sports bar but it doesn t really have that feel The drinks are also decent it s not watered down and the prices are reasonable I like some of their food too Best quesadillas in town Nachos are pretty good too Crab cakes are NOT good I m not a huge fan of the sandwiches but the fish sandwich special on Friday is okay 
c5EMEwrHyyvitMta9cFnMw CMU In my mind this is a first and foremost a bar An awesome bar with an a lofted upper level that looks down on the pool tables A bar that has more private cozy seating in the back A bar that sets up outside in the breezeway Crane s ALLEY Great beer selection Decent prices Lots of seating It was a pretty classy addition to downtown Urbana when it first opened And fooseball there are some crazy fooseball sharks Don t let their meager appearance fool you 
CGXm6K4T2Pvd05hnHZzFMg CMU I went here not long after it opened a few years back and the food was great On the expensive side for bar food but great I would stop in every now and again but not very frequently due to the prices The last time I went was about 5 months ago I don t know what happened but the food was TERRIBLE I had butternut squash ravioli in a cream sauce and it was just awful No flavor completely devoid of seasoning and the sauce may have been the Elmer s paste that comes in the little tubs with the brush attached to the cap It was actually grey in color Gross My husband had a chicken sandwich and it was small cold and cost about three times what he d have paid for the exact same sandwich quality wise from McDonald s The evening set us back about 60 bucks for a salad appetizer two entrees and two draft beers which is pricey for CU So not worth it We have no plans to go back 
CHcQgu2zhudHBQ-Kk7-hcw CMU The Courier Cafe is still the best place in C U to go for a salad bar with variety The atmosphere has a one of a kind casual ambient old timey charm Now if they resolve the recent issues with their buns they will also be in contention for best burger 
chDNXkIFYGDD9r4w5K3L-g CMU After always going to the bars on campus this is certainly a change up in downtown Champaign A chill atmosphere a lot more older people townies Just something different outside of the college town It took forever to get our food but I must say even with a very limited menu the food was delicious Typical greasy food but the western burger was just really good Surprisingly though the eggplant fries were amazingly delicious This was my first time trying eggplant fries so good my friends and I had to get a second order I would go here again the prices aren t bad and the service could have been better but when you re with people who make you laugh it overshadows that Go try it out even if it is just for the eggplant fries 
cTRMXeixrK6LjeaEtO1OkA CMU Based on my food alone 5 stars I had blackened tuna pita with petit salad and it was amazing as served My husband had a fried fish sandwich and it wasn t great but nothing compares to destihl s fried fish The service was terrible Our waitress was in a foul mood and had a bad attitude with every table in our section 
culQJF5NhWcUA8F05fEt3A CMU Crane Alley receives an admittedly very biased 5 stars from me This is partially because they re currently carrying two Bell s beers on tap Amber divine and Hopslam 2X 10 abv and so magically sweet AND hoppy that Teej my fiance and I decided that it must pour directly out of the Easter Bunny s anus the most magically sweet and hoppy of all the rabbit anuses as you know Bell s aside Crane Alley is a place I want to be at all the time It s dim but not dank Tasteful and not over the top The waitress checked in an appropriate amount of the time was friendly and had mad non spilling the water skills when pouring all the way to the top of the glass I had the falafel pita which was only okay but was later upgraded to good when I added salt and pepper It came with quinoa tabbouleh that was the slightest bit creamy and oh so plentiful Mmm quinoa tabbouleh 
CuPAm3FFYT2DJO5DAvIHzQ CMU Went here as a stop while crawling along UofI I think it s a cute place I like the interior design Nice bathrooms decent drinks Laid back atmosphere a huge step up from Kam s 
cY0_I89Ig0w40w2Rhgjgcg CMU After reading all the reviews on Yelp I had fairly expectations when I went to Courier Cafe I went for dinner on a week night and the place was almost completely empty The food is American sandwiches burgers soups salads and also more serious entrees I was going to go for the salmon but my waitress talked me out of it so I ended up getting the pork chops which came with soup The soup was black bean soup it was actually quite tasty and the portion was huge I expected just a small bowl since it was supposed to be a side I was almost full after finishing the soup and when the pork chops arrived and that was a good thing because I was not too impressed by them grilled pork chops lathered in bbq sauce really nothing too exceptional and the little side of salad that came with it didn t even have any dressing So the portion were huge it was pretty cheap I think I ended up paying under 15 including a soda but the food did not impress me much The service however was pretty friendly I tried going again for brunch on a Sunday morning but gave up when I saw the line I guess it gets quite crowded on the weekend which is generally a good sign so I ll have to give it another try for brunch 
c_2Gudv7G0ruRJ-MjWnv6A CMU I d really been looking forward to going here I d passed it several times and was just looking for an occasion Sunday morning brunch after V day with the boy seemed like a good option It was pretty hoppin and the inside was just what I expected it to be very cute and eclectic smattered with antiques but not in the Cracker Barrel way in the authentic way and cozy Because the menus on the website don t say when breakfast ends and lunch begins we weren t sure if we would have the option of choosing from either menu We got there at around 11 35 and the hostess gave us menus with just breakfast The menus are large so if you take a while to decide especially during brunch time be careful Our waitress stopped by once immediately after we were seated to get our drink orders and once about five minutes later We told her we needed a few minutes She came back shortly after and snapped at us saying that they were only serving breakfast for 5 more minutes so we needed to order then This was at around 11 45 I understand wanting to expedite things but if the switch was happening at 11 50 shortly after we arrived I think we should have been told by the waitress or the hostess that lunch was about to start after we had been seated I saw people ahead of us getting salads and soups but no lunch option was given to us Anyway he got the breakfast burrito and I got the breakfast sandwich His was very good and enormous The salsa verde was perfect I didn t even know I liked salsa on eggs I think I just misordered in my haste The croissant was not from their bakery it had the I came out of a cellophane wrapped plastic container from Sam s taste but it was large just not a real croissant The eggs were another problem they were a consistent yellow color and had rounded borders Not real scrambled eggs or maybe real but reconstituted The bacon was tasty the hashbrowns mushy Not worth 7 He gave me half of his burrito in exchange for half of mine I greatly benefited from the unfair trade I really want to like this place so I ll try it again in the next few weeks Hopefully I ll get a smiley waitress FYI prices are a little higher than those listed on the online menu but only about 50 60 cents 
C_yTJbB4hfRyMpQeklMacQ CMU The food at Friday s is a much better quality than the other similar type chains 
d4EXbnqCIhLCpGwAQRQdkA CMU I am making an edit to this review It is still a nice place where you can actually go with your friends or date and hear them Especially since you don t have to scream over the music and noise It is NOT a good place to have dinner any longer They changed their chef or something The miso mussels and linguine was horrible Totally alcoholic with no miso When I told the waitress she took my dish back to the kitchen and brought out something that was sooo salty Disgusting The mussels were also not fresh and made me sick later My friend ordered the reuben which used to be superb but was too salty as well You can guess that I will NOT be returning to eat here ever again It s a little more expensive than other bars in the area so expect the drinks to cost a little more than other places I am not a fan of the beer garden since it s basically an alley between it s building and the next 
df63tHi0H07tE9GaN-vQoQ CMU I like a fair amount of other people think that crane alley is pretty hit miss I love their beer selection and their bartenders are friendly We were their last weekend and their hostess almost drove us to insanity we had a group of 7 and two tables opened up more than enough so seat us all and instead of pushing them together she sat 2 people at the 4 person table and then let the other sit empty At that point we were told the wait would be 20 40 minutes After an hour still with empty tables we went to ask She said she d seat us in 10 minutes and finally 30 minutes later after bugging her twice more she got us a table The bartenders actually compted us the pool because they felt so bad That being said our waitress was very friendly though not always present but very accommodating Food was ok but we were annoyed that we waited 1 5 hours to be seated when there were empty tables the entire time we started to wonder if she was mad at certain wait staff members and trying to spite them by not sitting people in their sections That being said I have had much better experiences there and I hope that never happens to anyone else 
dFhSzBRwWl6uH7ePhXNUPA CMU This place is hit and miss I ve come here with my husband several times and have had decent food and the service is ok I would recommend breakfast over any other meal their burgers are pretty dry and the sandwiches are boring But when I come here by myself the waitresses are pretty rude as well as the hostess I came here yesterday and there were two tables that were full The hostess made me wait while she tallied up a stack of paperwork didn t seem to bother her that I m 5 months pregnant and would ve been more comfortable seated After I was seated it took the waitress 5 minutes to come over and get my order No hellos or how are yous just what do you want By that point other patrons had come in and she seemed perky and friendly with them My food came out fairly fast but my burger was underseasoned and overcooked At that point I just wanted to get out So I had to flag my now chatty waitress who was paying attention to every other table and asked for my check which she just slammed down on my table I didn t even bother leaving a tip nor will I ever return again 
DGJ55tkKNk7Op1iNN8uYRA CMU I give it 3 stars not because of its products or service but because of its prices I live in the east coast and have been to plenty of nice places that are much better and charge about the same for drinks and food but this is not NYC or Philly so come on I have also been to many places in the Savoy Champaign Urbana area and there are other installments as nice as this one that charge a more reasonable fee for drinks Other than that I like the staff and the food specially the sliders and a steak salad they have It would be nice if they had a live band once a week 
DKO8yL06JqmwglFk56kWyQ CMU I ve been told by many friends to take a visit to the courier cafe So with much pressure I gave in What was I thinking Even today I still am not quite sure I was really hungry and had been looking for something to satiate my lunch needs I decided on the quesedillas and my bf ordered the pesto veggie pita Let me say that neither was really that good especially the pesto pita The presentations of the food left something to be desired The one thing that was tasty on the menu was the chocolate peanut butter shake Not sure if a shake really has the ability to bring me back to a restaurant and in this case it doesn t The shake is what is bringing my review from 1 star to 2 The whole place is totally overrated and looks so unkempt 
DoVe8cDkuqgdFTlbdsdQLw CMU We have been coming into the Courier Cafe for years and despite the very tasty home cooked feel the meals at Courier Cafe have service has steadily deteriorated It has never been so bad The only reason why we placed 2 stars is because of the food Money saving Mystery Butter blend On numerous occasions when we dined here we had a very hard time getting an order in When ordering a plate the waitress was cold and stern We asked her to bring plain butter rather than their money saving mystery butter blend and she was making a face and saying Oh I m not sure I can do that despite the fact that they have pure butter at hand She was selective about who she served and was overall rude Kicking customers out the door Then Chuck the manager and his waitress came up to our table well before closing hour and started moaning about how he is closing soon and was trying to kick us out in advance Ignoring customers The last time we came here we sat outside as the waitress Nicole was serving someone else Although we said hi she blatantly ignored us and we had to walk into the restaurant and talk to the manager JUST TO PLACE OUR ORDER It was so bad We watched the manager baby sit the waitress as he told her you have customers waiting for you Nicole But she had seen us before and consciously ignored us A few minutes after we came back out to dine outside Nicole the waitress walked towards us and gave us a very phony smile Insolent manager On this other occasion Chuck The Manager was chatting with us after dinner and he called my friend a Liar simply because he was trying to get him to guess where we were from He also called us Disingenuous for the same reason Summary Overall The Courier Cafe has great food but due to a grumpy and harassing Manager and rude waitresses who need to be told that they have tables waiting for them we are strongly considering never dining there again 
dSPukOXKyJt3xYgAQIPv2Q CMU This friday s has been recently remodelled so it s nice and clean and new looking even though it s been around for awhile The remodelling job itself SCREAMS trying to hard but that s probably friday s corporate s fault They will serve you your pecan crusted sicilian teriyaki quesadillas with green bean fries and cheesecake in a reasonable amount of time and without any of the way way way over the top smarm that you might expect from a friday s waitstaff And you don t have to drive all the way up to North Prospect Three stars is probably the maximum I am able to give to any friday s anywhere just out of principle so this awarding of three stars should really say to you best possible friday s 
dwt35YdSPbS_SaMVkeSZBw CMU Uggh I think Guido s is my favorite bar in champaign The uggh is because my favorite place in champaign still has miller light girls wearing slutty referree outfits at football games I m pretty sure they have the best bloody mary s in town and their pineapple upside down cake martini is more or less killer as are all their specialty cocktails for that matter Which is probably why if you go after 9PM even if you are lucky enough to not have to stand in line you almost definitely won t be able to get a table 
DwYhRVx7wOv1RJ8HFkg0WQ CMU Tourists Treated Same As Home Folks I used to be home folks returned as a tourist and it s true This was always a place I brought visitors to show off midwestern charm The food is comforting and good It s not innovative fusion cuisine it s darn good burgers and milkshakes in a cozy venue Plus old fashioned soda fountain Where else can you even get a phosphate anymore And yes the salad bar rules When I lived near downtown Urbana I would sometimes come here for breakfast on a weekday That was nice Weekend breakfast is a zoo WAY crowded huge lines There is a reason for that it s THAT GOOD 
dX-iGTPh-gafCxrPUMTs0g CMU You know I really wanted this to be a 5 star joint I love the ambiance of the corner bar dark wood and dimly lit interior and the extensive offerings of specialty vodkas gins and whiskeys The cheese curd appetizer was very good but not out of this world The beer batter was a little soft and I suspect the cheese had not been frozen prior to deep frying or not completely which resulted in most of the cheese over melting and dripping out of the solidified batter shell Still tasty but missing the mark a little bit The sliders were pretty good but the BBQ had too much botte tasting sauce on it The beef was cooked perfectly though Caesar salad was average at best On the plus side they have a nice selection of draft and bottled beer 
e1uNPqUPti_uTDcjDjM_4A CMU Good local pub Had the triple combo with the california chicken slider southwest salad and fresh fruit and the food was awesome Will definately be back again Service was a bit slow but it sure beats the chain resturants on the other side of town Great selection of sliders soup and salads Extensive beer and wine list 
E75jt9Lg9K4LqEVdR_-rsg CMU This was an o k place when it was around 7 a meal students would stock up and make it their only meal of the day ultimately filling the belly and saving a bit of cash The only real saving grace for this place is that you can bill a departmental account I highly suspect that s the primary reason we see Prof s and visitors here often I personally apologize for the food when there with guests The waiters aren t really waiters but sort of I ll get you your drink when I feel like it ers I ll just ignore this stack of used dishes while asking if you want coffee ers The dishes remind me of school cafeteria food but from chefs who passed the next level up of culinary cafeteria school I think I may have finished my salad All else left me cold and wanting Try to avoid if you can Unfortunately all my grad friends somehow think this is all a good deal for 10 Seriously can it be called a place to eat if they can t even serve a glass of coke with carbonation left Do they pour them in the morning for the lunch hour 
e8vNc91B71YcohsqvStGAg CMU Probably my favorite place to go to get some well priced and delicious food on a night out It s also the place I recommend when people from out of town ask where they should go for dinner The service there is very friendly and prompt and the food is good I ve never had the salmon burgers but I wouldn t expect the fish dishes to be the best in the heart of Central Illinois anyway The Buffalo Chicken Slider and Classic Slider with Cheese are my favorites along with a side of waffle fries although if you re a fan of sweet potato fries they have the best in town The chipotle ranch sauce that comes with the onion rings is amazing the tomato bisque is absolutely out of this world and they have a great selection of whiskey and beer at the bar I really think of this place as more of a restaurant than a bar though They tend to get busy on Friday and Saturday nights and if the wait is long make sure you re back earlier than you think if you decide to walk around the area Definitely one of the gems in Champaign Urbana and a place that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good meal at a decent price 
ec3_FTqtsk8XLnrpAzi48g CMU We hopped on over to the Courier Cafe on a Saturday night to get some ice cream sundae and more The building is authentically old and the decor is pretty much 100 yrs old but very clean and interesting The service was ok the waiter forgot to get my drink But thats ok they were kind of busy I guess The food was totally different scale I ordered the skinny dippers following recommendation of another yelper The skinny dippers are just potato peals dont mistake them for potato skins the meatier kind deep fried and topped with some veggies cream etc Its like a heart attack on a plate and the taste wasnt worth the extra grease on the plate The sundae was blah nothing to talk about Very mediocre Over all if you are a drunk grad looking for a bite late night this is the place for you 
ED7xzLh0y7ZMsRz6yDNSgg CMU Oh how I miss Courier Cafe Every single time I come back to C U for something I try and grab lunch here I ve never had a bad meal here The Banker s Burger is fantastic the Monkey Stuff sandwich sounds weird but is amazing Some of the sandwiches are obscene in their size Asking for a side of mayo is a mistake as they will bring you a 1 4 of mayo The sweet potato chips are delicious They also have a salad bar that has a decent selection But ignore all of what I said above because none of it matters Even if Courier had the worst lunch and breakfast food on earth I d still go for the shakes Oh my god the shakes I get the shakes thinking about their shakes Feeling like a high roller Order the apple pie shake Some of the waitresses will not know what you are talking about but once you explain it to them they will make it Piece of apple pie ice cream blender apple pie shake They will charge you for both a slice of pie and a shake and it is worth every penny Great to take your date who isn t watching her figure or is way too damn skinny and needs to bulk up a bit Seriously stop reading and go get an apple pie shake 
eM8EnPRYyZp5VhyyXOCC2Q CMU This place has so much potential so it s kind of sad that they don t have better service My fiance and I waited at the bar for a drink for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us what we wanted That may not sound too long but the place wasn t even busy And what s funny is the bartender was like purposely ignoring us There s no way she didn t see us politely flagging her down She had a soft drink that she was drinking and she stopped right in front of us took a nice looooong drink kind of relaxing then she looked past us out the window and proceeded to ignore us a bit longer And its not like we were just standing there you can try and flag them down but they just ignore you like alien possessed humans staring into space or something The bartender finally asked what we wanted but by then we were being seated so we said nevermind Then we proceeded to have terrible service at our table to the point that it was just kind of amusing Oh and my cobb salad had these huge mushroom tentacle things that made me gag and we just sorta wiggled them at our friends like look at this huge sick thing that s in my salad And the sliders are way over priced The cheese curds were good but a little heavy I say the place has potential because it s a really nice location and the inside has a nice ambiance There is also an extensive beer list but none of that really matters if your service is that bad 
enntcEw7Ibzj6Oe-lncdqA CMU This Friday s is pretty great The food is consistent with every other Friday s but the service is always great I have been here approximately 4 5 times over the last two months and I haven t been disappointed Tried a variety of their dishes but must say the fried green bean appetizer is quite tasty Each time with a different server may I add service has been prompt and they have been attentive while not overbearing Sat at a high top in the bar late one evening and the lady behind the bar was providing excellent service to us in addition to running the busy bar They also have a rewards program that can be very beneficial and it is tough to beat the 2 for 10 although the selection for it is somewhat limited Just a random thought to ponder I was in here on a Friday and I was hoping Rebecca Black would come on It didn t though Overall 5 star effort on the service and a 3 star on the consistent chain restaurant food 
eskUUbC81UXjLq9BVtih5Q CMU The first few times I went it was great which was maybe a year ago Good service drinks and appetizers Went again with a group last weekend and was very unimpressed The food was mediocre at best I had a shitty ham sandwich that cost more than what it should have and a so so chunky tomato bisque Probably will only go back for drinks without the intention of getting food 
eWFZ9iCCmCC5GCEqW4daKg CMU Went here for lunch today and it was just so so I ordered half portobella mushroom sandwich and half black and blue salad I love salads but this one just wasn t right The steak in it was so chewy I took it off the salad but then the salad was still warm It had grilled onions and mushrooms on it which I find odd I think it s weird to have grilled onions in a salad Maybe it s me but it s just not right The mushroom sandwich was soggy and not very good Actually the mushrooms were just fine but putting it together in a sandwich with cheese and red peppers just didn t do it for me They do not go together in my opinion Basically I found both items odd The server was great and the food came out fast I will give them credit for that I have been here a few times and this is not a place that I would volunteer up if someone was asking for suggestions where to eat Some people love it and some people don t 
EXrO6sg3DXPbnkb9VBx2bg CMU I d probably give this joint 3 5 stars but I ll make do with 4 since it was a great weekend Pros 1 Good beer list Left Hand Milk Stout for 4 50 This Chicago girl says yes please 2 Tasty food I had the slider salad sweet potato fries combo and everything was really good They re known for their sliders apparently 3 Great vibe We didn t feel rushed here Didn t feel pressured to drink more and they didn t blink when our party size doubled and we moved to a different table Cons 1 Small ish portions At 10 for the above mentioned meal I felt a little unsatisfied The sliders seem pricey at 3 a pop too 2 Service A bit slow It picked up when we started strictly drinking but there was nary a condiment to be found during our meal All in all I d head back It s a nice joint in downtown Champaign 
F1RYaezb5CLgN-J7O8oPuQ CMU My favorite place in town I started going there because I live close by The food is excellent slightly creative pub style Excellent beer selection rotating taps mean you ll always find something new Waitstaff seem to have been turning over a lot lately which can lead to inconsistent service Usually good though 
f2MhOziX2mwfXUC1b-4iVw CMU As close to a nice night out as you can find in CU The food s always been solid the drinks good and the service ok However it does get VERY noisy during the dinner hour While it may not be a true 5 star for CU it deserves it By the way why does a city with such a strong mixed population have such a terrible restaurant scene Will there ever be any NICE restaurants 
f2twVsmpbCCodrqMpgAamA CMU The only way this place gets three stars is because the service was good and our food was good My wife and i went there for lunch I got the chicken salad and fries She got a veggie sandwich and onion rings My sandwich was good and hers was ok They were what they were No frills The veggie sandwich was just a plain veggie sandwich The reason this place needs less stars is because I would liken it to a TGI Friday s or Chili s There is just nothing that would set it apart from standard American fare I am glad I just went there for lunch rather than dropping more money at dinner 
F4xQrKRW7kv5HbSWGQx6dw CMU Met a friend for lunch here one day Decent place Not too crowded for a campus town spot At the suggestion of my friend I opted for the Nacho plate Huge serving and it was quite good Everything is firehouse themed as far as the menu is concerned and so many of the burgers and sandwiches and wraps sounded delicious Will have to go again sometime and try one Service was quick and friendly 
FCj76Fm-u-G4TrQz6nDKWg CMU YUM we would trek it off campus to go here it s the best place off campus for burgers and shakes The shakes are huge and they give you the silver cup too so it s like 2 shakes for the price of one Service was always really good un pretentious atmosphere 
fhJNvrmIA1th43C_jYTlnA CMU Great almond french toast decent coffee but the place could use some sprucing up 
fiW2Z4lC1lAWPUQkSkGmtQ CMU Having only consumed their alcohol at an outdoor table I can t really comment on the interior or the food However a girl we were with kept praising the waffle fries I thought our drinks were served quickly were reasonably priced and I liked the fact that no one was trying to move us inside even though it was midnight and 8 of us were still sitting there I was surprised and actually though our waitress was joking if when we asked for the check she asked if we wanted on check or separate checks I almost expect to get attitude from a server if a two top asks for separate checks It took her awhile to sort everything out but hey she asked for it Kudos to her for making my life a little easier 
FLo1Lh1ONjMZoMBbd2l4WA CMU Everyone knows this place is known for their sliders and they are certainly worth a try I liked them enough to go back a few times while living in the area and always had a good service and good food Never tried anything outside of the sliders 
flr9jO7m9UdfgbUbgRlwhw CMU This place opened my last year of college and I really liked it because it was a 21 and up bar While I didn t go to Illinois I spent many a weekend partying down there We loved the somewhat clean feel to Firehaus and the cheap drinks I went back this weekend for my brothers graduation and it is now an absolute madhouse on the weekends It s still a pretty solid place but it has become more of your typical Champaign bar 
Fn7Lq51SqEQOA3JOGglwEg CMU Decent bar food decent beer I like to go here early for lunch since service is faster and it hasn t gotten too loud yet Don t expect anything very healthy here there are a few salads and a veggie wrap but all have cheese or dressing which I guess you could get on the side Onion rings are good I ve heard the mac n cheese is tasty and many of the burgers are on wonderful pretzel rolls As a note they have something called haus sauce which is just their buffalo sauce so don t be fooled Never been here during peak evening hours so I can t comment on that but an ok place for lunch and a beer 
FNfn1dOqccTZwa3QAyAPBw CMU I ve been to Crane Alley 4 or 5 times The first time I went I had the chicken pesto with goat cheese and red peppers It was so good that I keep coming back just for that It s so good that I don t want to try anything else I m from the Chicago area so I can only visit a few times per year I was there yesterday and they just put on a new beer Bitburger from Germany It was on special and it was a great beer that went along great with my outstanding sandwich 
FSUa059fXmZmVmUuvrOL3A CMU First bar experience so it was alright Wasn t expecting a whole lot Burgers are amazing though a bit overpriced but OMG their special mayonnaise is sooo good The service isn t great my friend got the wrong order and the waitress was like are you sure 
FVne1S4GXtqAX9enCBIoyg CMU My god I was expecting a good breakfast Pretty good even But I am a breakfast aficionado Breakfast is something I take very seriously And I am not lenient in my judgments of breakfast foods That said My god And furthermore Holy bejesus Their corned beef hash was otherworldly It is without question the most perfect and wonderful corned beef hash I have ever eaten It was bumped beyond that by the addition of sauteed mushrooms This was served with eggs sunny side up the only kind to eat with hash rye toast and hashbrowns For 7 25 that is a metric ton of food I m still kind of full and it s been nearly 8 hours My dining companions had french toast and pancakes with meat sides FYI a full plate of sausage links amount to two full sized brats and they were delicious Not as delicious as the corned beef hash but good nonetheless I anxiously await my next visit 
FxMykcisJR_gRSQSFMq2qg CMU So overall the food here I ve had has been really good I will say though that if you go to Crane Alley it s not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants esp not the alcohol Another thing my friends and I noticed is that if you get appetizers they normally give you way more dipping material hummus spinach and artichoke dip etc than you can use up with the pita provided You will get charged extra if you ask for more pita They always have a nice selection of beverages particularly beers but there s a cocktail list as well again just plan on it being pricey If fresh and local is important to you they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might see at Market at the Square in the summer In the end it s a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the evening with your friends in the actual alley part of Crane Alley 
G1rcWKA1_2kl9wwizlBb8A CMU 3 stars for Guido s No more no less The menu is very limited I was surprised at how limited Maybe we were there at an off time where they were in between lunch and dinner and that s the bar menu I m not sure but it was small On our table Queso Nachos Teriyaki chicken sandwich Grilled cheese Both sandwiches came with eggplant fries as an upcharge The queso and nachos looked better than they tasted The grilled cheese was standard The teriyaki chicken sandwich was very salty and very dry The eggplant fries stole the show They were delicious with a side of grainy honey mustard for dipping They re probably the only thing I d go back for Also if you want a cup of coffee as my dad did be aware that they use a Keurig and therefore charge by the cup No free refills on your joe 
g51mZX37i1H_IdRqU0-iWQ CMU One of my favorite places to take guests from out of town They make a mean milkshake for starters Their burgers are great and they always taste great with their sweet potato fries which I got serendipitously and have liked them eversince I enjoy the decor and all of the fascinating objects in the building and I like how they provide a description of each memorable item on the back of the menu The service is always been great and they always provide an excellent experience The parking east of the cafe never is a problem so that is indeed another plus 
g7YIJmoEnygtl6X2caoXLQ CMU Used to frequent this place but the last few times I have been here the food has been awful The bar is decent but with all of those bottles one would think the drink menu would be more expansive Best time to go is when you can sit outside However that is less than a 3 month window and outside of it the ambiance is as cold as the weather Great location Make better use of it 
g8k5njiP0ypDqHO1L7rj3Q CMU Service 5 Food 3 Price 1 I decided to eat breakfast at Courier Cafe last week after reading all the good reviews I ordered two eggs sausage potatoes small fruit bowl and coffee The waitress did an excellent job looking over me just enough without being intrusive The eggs over easy were too easy The yolk was properly runny but unfortunately so was the white Sausages were tasty but not seasoned enough The hash browns were good but could have been crisper The English muffin that came with the meal was toasted well but buttered too heavily The total bill was 11 13 so plus the tip my breakfast cost over 13 00 Next time I ll check the prices on the menu I just assumed that they were in line with other breakfast eateries I would give this place two stars if the service had not been excellent 
gcr69LRttIbEYN-zgnBo6g CMU The food here is only okay but there is something utterly perfect about a campus lunchtime meal at the Intermezzo If you re a veggie go for the nachos and or veggie burger I also recommend you appreciate along with me the gruff style of the cashier Untouchable 
GcwFGODTnfpLM-wT1hjreg CMU if you re a vegetarian this place is super friendly breakfast offers tofu scramble instead of eggs and vegetarian breakfast sausage it s nice to have options instead of just having pancakes again there is a nice salad bar but to be honest the quality of that is hit or miss sometimes it s really fresh and all the salads look like they have just been prepped but sometimes and it seems like it s been more often the salad bar looks sad i actually got a scoop of slimy carrots the last time it was way gross and it wasn t something i noticed until i had plopped the big scoop on my plate thus ruining the rest of my salad they allowed me to take a new plate and start again but it was pretty gross if you like alternative proteins like beans and tofu there is plenty on the bar however the beans are just dumped from can to salad bar and are full of that gelatinous goo that the beans float around in in the can you know the stuff you usually rinse off thoroughly the service is generally fantastic a lot of their wait staff is attentive and friendly especially in the morning there are some night staff that seem to forget you exist but for the most part it s decent service all in all if your vegetarian or vegan there are options which is difficult to find for a sit down meal in this town and don t feel like having sushi or lo mein i would give it 4 5 but just because the quality of some things like service and salad bar is hit or miss 
GD6n0F86Sp3PF0pEU63Dew CMU I took the Amtrak down to U of I for a football game this past weekend vs Michigan Illinois won SWEET The train got in over an hour late which seems to be a common occurrence on this route but I was still a few hours early for the game so I grabbed some lunch at this place which is right across the street from the Amtrak station I was happy to see that it was not jam packed on game day morning I was by myself so I sat at the bar I was impressed with the large selection of beers available both on tap and by the bottle I m used to Chicago prices so being able to get a good draft beer for under 5 bucks was great They also have Miller High Life on tap for 2 if you re looking to go cheap Food wise I went with a couple turkey sliders since the menu claims that is what they are famous for I also had some of the sweet potato fries The sliders were just okay I wasn t blown away by them or anything Same thing with the fries The portion was large but I wasn t crazy about them I went ahead and doused them in ketchup after I realized they weren t that good It was a meal that was adequate and not expensive each slider was 2 50 and the fries were 1 99 if I am remembering correctly so I m not complaining My total for 2 draft beers the food and tip was just over 20 The bartender introduced himself as Billy Mays and had on an Oxyclean shirt which was his Halloween costume He was nice enough and occasionally engaged in small talk even as the place started to get more crowded I didn t have any problems with him keeping my water and beer full and my food was correct so no issues there When all is said and done I can t give this place 5 stars simply because I wasn t blown away by anything But this is definitely a sold 4 star establishment 
gFXzWIvn5TngxeK7gRO5Sg CMU Came here to grab a bite with friends Their cheeseburger and chips deal on Tuesdays is awesome and it s only 2 99 so it s super affordable for broke college students Will be back soon 
GrW96p-AjJWYN7TWF05pbw CMU I like their decor and I like their onion rings I also like that getting blue cheese is an option for the burgers Other than that I was just not impressed It was one of those non busy times when there seem to be 10 bored waitresses milling around but not one of them is actually helping you It seriously took 10 minutes between being seated and seeing our waitress Then our burger orders were mixed up Then we didn t see our waitress until it was time to leave It s also worth noting that while I may sometimes have the self esteem and paranoia of a 13 year old emo girl I really feel like the waitress was judging me On a more food related note I was DEFINITELY unimpressed by the veggie burger It was over spiced with chili powder which made my choice of blue cheese crumbles unappetizing It seemed like it came out of a package which could be true but I ve never had a bad Boca burger Definitely not worth it for the price 
gvx4RmlluBzfYAZFyD3DbQ CMU Great atmosphere and great food Love this place always a favorite experience when visiting the area I understand they close every year for 1 week for deep cleaning and general sprucing up I make sure I don t visit the week after Christmas as to miss eating there Every restaurant should do this I would always recommend The Courier Cafe 
gZ-6OaQGdJI1BRhOQiZblg CMU This is my new favorite place for lunch in C U Good selection of sandwiches salads soups reasonable prices plenty of tables and a nice atmosphere It feels more grown up than most of your other lunch options but the food is ready super fast A number of veggie selections and the desserts look amazing 
gzy9mMKFh-waTGKrFHQN4w CMU First off free pool till 4 00 All around this place is an excellent weekend afternoon relaxation spot We stopped in this past Saturday around 2 00 It wasn t empty but it was far from busy and the pool tables were unoccupied If I didn t live out of town this would be my March Madness go to spot Second other good details I got the turkey pita which was just the right size fresh and slightly crunchy pita bread plenty of meat and delicious with guacamole The beer selection here is impressive covering a wide range of styles and breweries from around the country I consider myself fairly familiar with the microbrew landscape and yet they still had about 12 beers that I had never even heard of plus Crane Alley does modestly priced flights of 4 x 5 ounce tasters 6 a buck for the really obscure choices The servers were all nice and quick to help out whenever we needed them 
hC7XgYXuaWc7_2RKE0Kn6g CMU This could be the most overrated place in CU Beer selection good everything else pretty bad Service was particularly bad when we went and the food was not great for the price We ordered desert before our appetizers because we particularly wanted one of the options By the time we finished our main course the waiter informed us that they had just sold out of the dessert we had ordered long before We were shocked by his honesty and incompetence 
HcajrOxtdUBv-O0EJahBRA CMU The other night my girlfriend and I went out to the Courier Cafe in downtown Urbana Having been there before I knew that it was a good place to go for a relatively cheap meal which is why I capitulated rather quickly Courier Cafe is one of the older restaurants in downtown Urbana having been open since 1980 As such it has outlasted many other downtown Urbana businesses and enshrined their memory in the names of its burgers Speaking of burgers they are the primary reason I go to the Courier Cafe Burgers are around 5 6 and are 1 3 of a pound The burgers also tend to be higher quality than the standard pub fare considering people go there for food instead of ordering a burger as an afterthought On this night I opted for the Darcy s burger which is a burger with mushrooms and bleu cheese The burger comes on a plate with all of the other assorted toppings including onions tomatoes lettuce and pickles off to the side so you can add them to taste The burger comes well done unless you specify otherwise The meat itself is relatively juicy for being a grilled burger and the bun tastes more like it came from a genuine bakery instead of a store brand 8 pack of buns which often ends up being the case in burger restaurants Another thing Courier is known for is its old style sweet drinks such as its phosphates and New York egg creme drinks These are sugary soda type drinks with flavored syrup with the egg creme being a phosphate with an egg cracked into it and creme added Courier also has a variety of ice cream desserts Courier s wine and beer menu is not very extensive but they have had Rogue Dead Guy on draft for 4 the last few times I have gone which is cheaper than most bars in the area In addition their bottled beers are relatively cheap and the wine by the glass is inexpensive as well Though the menu is not extensive there is a good enough variety to please most individuals For two people with burgers drinks and one order of fries the total bill ended up being 18 84 This is much lower than one would pay for an equivalent meal anywhere else even a place like Murphy s which has a similar food menu though lower quality food Courier is a perfect spot for a cheap date where your date won t know you re being cheap unless you let her see the check 
hfPeO4YRrx7GDVdMSAKpGA CMU I ve never been served or treated worse in my whole life at any bar or restaurant I went here last year with a few friends after a sorority event and we sat at a booth for 20 minutes thinking we would get waited on We finally went up to the bar to order food and drinks and the bartender told us we had to wait for a waitress who was just sitting at the bar talking We went back to sit down and after another five minutes after she heard us talking about ordering she came over It took another hour to get our food and the orders were not all correct Needless to say it took some coaxing to get me to come back For my birthday my friends all planned a surprise dinner and took me here Well after another 15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge us 10 to get drinks and 45 to get our food they FORGOT MY ORDER The waitress knew it was my birthday knew my food order got lost and never even apologized or said anything about making it up to me Maybe this place is okay for the drinking atmosphere but never ever come for good service or food 
hg9Udv-BjDVozA94cyFoBg CMU Having 1 billion things on your menu doesn t make you a good restaurant I really have no idea why they have so many things unless it is really just the same 8 basic ingredients reformatted for each entry But still it hurts my head just to open the menu So I ordered the first picture i saw that looked appetizing Fish Tacos Unfortunately they ruined what would have probably been an awesome fish taco by leaving the fish in the fryer about 3 minutes too long There s nothing like a hard dry dark crunchy breading on dried out fish to make you think twice about ever ordering fish tacos again But there was an awesome sauce in a little cup on the plate a southwest style hint of lime and cilantro dressing Delicious But our waiter sucked He actually yawned while repeating our order I mean Come On I should have left him a 1 and told him to get some sleep 
Hh6ou-uAJPkRlIo_NYNbpA CMU Many great revolving beers on tap and a delish black bean burger Play pool inside or sit outside I love this joint 
Hho6w-_JNLIuQ4S3oHZkNw CMU i ve had decidedly mixed experiences at courier my first time included being too loud and being rudely but passive aggressively kicked out its a complication situation to get into but i believe my good friend t j explains it all in his first review in any case courier is a good place to go if you want to feel like your in a neighborhood place that is so established that sometimes the service might suck and sometimes the food might suck even the coffee might suck to couriers credit when the food and drink doesnt suck its delicious but they have KILLER thick lovely milkshakes and absolutely delicious chorizo topped potato skins always everything else is a hit or miss but doesn t that just make the dining experience so much more fun ok i might be stretching it a little but i do love courier because i think at this point i could not live without a little chocolate malt goodness in my life every once in a while what can i say i m hooked 
hlBZJ8csrel5_8Dmt6m4VQ CMU Stopped by here for lunch dinner it was 3 what meal does that count as it was pretty quiet since we didn t come during regular lunch dinner hours Crane Alley is a Restaurant Bar but it definitely feels more like a bar than a restaurant it s very dimly lit there are pool tables and a large bar area I guess if you like bars feel comfortable in bars you probably won t notice this I got the veggie sandwich and it was amazingly good Please allow me to list the ingredients of this most tasty of sandwiches cucumber bell peppers onion tomato sprouts lettuce basil oil sunflower seeds and dill cream cheese all on two big slices of wheat bread The greek pasta salad was also tasty and overall it was a very satisfying generous portioned meal for a little under 7 My boyfriend had a hamburger and it was HUGE The fries were good and he liked the burger although he said it had some kind of seasoning on it which he seemed kind of eh about Between the two of us we spent about 15 before tip and without any drinks Not bad The desserts also sounded really good flourless chocolate cake mmm but we passed on that this time I ll definitely be back I feel like if I had any interest in beer then this would be my new favorite place but since I m not a fan of beer or bars in general that s kind of a deterrent for me completely aware I m in the minority here Oh well I ll still come back for their yummy food 
htH5tnzFcklKCN1MXzijNQ CMU PROS Great drinks friendly service fun busy atmosphere interesting large menu my favs are the mediterranean style Mezze plate and the Falafel sandwich both of which are pretty rare to find around here great specials reasonable prices good healthy options CONS Booth area is slightly odd in terms of interior design I wish they would revamp it and make it less claustrophobic somehow 
hy6T8mkLsbD6VxuKCQhIqw CMU Courier was one of my favorite spots for fooding back in the day The quaint rustic decor and simple menu definitely shouldn t deter anyone from trying this place out The shakes are amazing not too overwhelmingly sweet and I love that they give you all of what they make even the portion that doesn t fit in the cup The burgers are classic simple no frills good meat fresh toppings cooked to perfection I d also highly recommend the brunch menu here Alas it was a rare occasion that I would be awake for it but you can learn from my mistakes and get yourself some delicious brunch at Courier For such a historic building Courier Cafe has done a great job of preserving the past and giving people a taste of the olden times 
HYIFnjHnFRykeMS6cdP95g CMU Food Ordered a Prime Rib Sandwich and by no means expected an actual cut of prime rib I d guess it was a cut of ribeye but it was still pretty tasty nonetheless somewhat fatty but it s to be expected on these types of sandwiches Ordered mine cajun style with a side salad meaning I got a steak sandwich that was pretty well seasoned For 10 it was a pretty good fix of red meat Service My waitress was very friendly She refilled my water made sure my food came out correct and was very personable Ambiance Guido s seems to be more of a sports bar type of place at least I think TVs everywhere pool tables I ve heard it can get pretty rowdy on weekend nights For lunchtime it was pretty quiet and I was able to hold conversation It was clean but I guess I hope for personality out of a restaurant in which Guido s just doesn t really have much Overall I enjoyed Guido s but I can t really say there s anything about it that makes it highly distinguishable The food while very good was pretty standard in selection For having the best location in Champaign it just feels like they re trying to play it safe which I suppose I can t fault them for Pleasant time overall 
HywrzAiDWkIu4CvPAI2hZQ CMU The food is great The atmosphere is very comforting The wait staff is always friendly Be sure to try the Bennet Burger it s not on the menu anymore but they can still make it 
HzlYzZQESx_OnPQ4GPVI0g CMU Right next door to downtown Urbana is Bunny s the most unrated bar in Urbana They ve got the cheap drinks and food the outdoor patio and lack of scenesters Thank God With the smoking ban in place this small time bar is probably struggling for business Stop in and have a few drinks drop a few quarters in the jukebox and tip your bartenders 
I773CV5FLqoQNROoMDBCfw CMU Service is incredibly accommodating Food is pretty darn good Pool tables with a nice cozy darkness that doesn t attract too many obnoxious student types Check Just like any other great bar until you notice that they have Dark Horse Crooked Tree IPA on tap And they re planning a dinner event to honor Dogfish Head where they ll be tapping a keg of the holy 120 minute IPA Impressive Way to stock the best beers I didn t realize those vendors even made it down to Central Illinois Oh and I almost forgot they have Beet Chips with a Chevre dipping sauce Definitely worth a go 
iaKt1XaBiYCjW35rgl39tA CMU IMO one of the only reasons to ever go into Urbana This is a place I visit often when I come back to see the family A nice bar with pool tables and an area upstairs There is a nice beer garden in the alley next to the bar Plenty of goodies on tap and in bottles Boulevard Smokestack offerings some Flossmoor Station Two Brothers DFH A really good bottle list too I believe they also have a monthly beer club that meets here as well The food is great Lots of sandwiches and several other entrees that are top notch They have the best fish sandwich in Champaing Urbana A good burger and Reuben About the only thing I have to complain about is the service The waitresses can be slow and don t always get the order right Besides that a great place to quaff some quality beers in downtown Urbana 
ibm1FOvNxkytJbIF2nzDSw CMU What comes to mind when I think of Guido s Three things Nachos Burgers Want Everything else about this place kinda fades into the background for me at least The decor and ambiance are nice enough I suppose though a bit on the dark side But seriously who cares I m there for the nachos anyway These bad boys are listed under appetizer but don t be fooled the order is huuuuge and definitely could hold its own as an entree If you re going to Guido s get the nachos End of story 
id5HzRY50ahaVqCXVNzhow CMU This is an update to my full review below I have been chided by yelp message probably from the owner or his friend that it is OK to call a tortilla dish rarebit My feeling is that if you were going for a zany take on rarebit that an insider would get no luck I moved here from Britain When I saw the tortilla labeled rarebit my reaction was This place doesn t know what they are doing Admittedly the item on the menu labeled spanish is far weirder 
IFRTurfgkLPWMnOcF6cE1Q CMU My first few trips to Seven Saints were excellent The place had just opened The service was excellent This would have been a four star review had that not changed Perhaps the owners need to start dropping back in or have people mystery shop the place The menu while not wildly innovative was well thought out The appetizers are well done and set up to share though the fried portabella mushroom strips on the Seven Sinners plate had that I ve sat in cold storage flavor to them That said the cheese curds and also the beet chips were excellent I liked the sliders favoring the blackjack and the buffalo chicken slider The triple S plate used to be more of a deal when they would allow you to get two sliders and either a soup or salad I was sorry to see that go I ve not tried the specials and each time I ve been everyone has done sliders sandwiches soup or salads so I cant speak to them The desserts are nothing special but were decently presented Out first few trips the staff was excellent We were seated relatively quickly despite being packed Someone came to take our drink orders in the first few minutes The waitress was willing to explain things to my party and make substitutions to satisfy vegetarian friends The beer selection was decent and the mixed drinks were decently strong While prices were a bit on the steep side we were fairly happy On a later trip the service was slow the raspberry iced tea was short on the raspberry syrup and to be frank I felt rushed out the door once we were done with our entree That was too bad as the people I was with are the sort prone to ordering dessert and a couple rounds of drinks If the place was crowded I could have understood but it seemed sort of empty Other reviews have mentioned a chain like feel It s true the same group owns a few other local bars so I m assuming they use the same architects designers and back office staff That said I kind of like the decor and think with a little work on the service Seven Saints could warrant four stars 
IhtTzGDdFeLsNdnYLWT6ZQ CMU Best breakfast in CU The Courier breakfast is fantastic especially with the sausage links which are essentially English bangers Delicious When anyone visits town I make a point to take them to Courier because it is such a good representation of what CU has to offer The coffee selection is almost always great and service is typically delightful 
IkOUziaVV6DeHy-m76eosA CMU A place to drink eat and play that virtual motorcycle game with three of your closest friends plus tons of billiard tables Just a little north of campus It s a large place so it s a good destination for drinks after work or other large gatherings they do events as well The sandwiches and burgers are very heavy and caloric Beer and wine selection are not huge 
IkZlYsALzff3eG2KCJ6CnQ CMU I give it 3 stars for lunch and dinner because I really only think the place is okay It has a nice decor but the food is just regular American They rave about their hand dipped shakes but again I can t figure out the difference between theirs and Steak and Shake I think the menu is simply a little boring I give it 4 stars because I think the breakfast is a LOT better Be sure to get there before 11 30 for this I really like their Spanish omelette if you like chorizo or a spicy sausage this is for you corned beef hash and biscuits and gravy half portion suffices in my opinion Oh and their pancakes are really REALLY good because they use fresh fruit Try the blueberry The strawberry is good but not as good as the blueberry 
imLjodog_dF7cKFf2K-wpw CMU I went here for a business meeting after a seminar It was about 5pm and sure it was raining but the lights were turned down really low ready for the night crowd although it seemed a little early for night time lighting So I thought it was a little dark but anyway I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was alright I d give it an average rating You would think paying 8 for a bacon burger they would put more than 2 skimpy slices of bacon on it The fries were good though They were the super skinny ones sort of like Murphy s I did not check out their beer selection not because it was a business meeting but I had serious studying to do after wards so I can t comment on that aspect I can see it being a good place for groups to go Not sure what the night crowd is like It s maybe a little fancy but not required Like if you wanted to go out and dress up you could probably go here but if you were in jeans and a t shirt that would be okay too Know what I mean The waitress was nice it has a large open area I think a pool table and booths and tables along the perimeter And outdoor seating 
iMyrMJr_3umugD-nurTvPw CMU Don t order the fish here it s clearly frozen not fresh I ve been to this restaurant several times with groups While there s a decent drink beer selection it seems like most of the time alot of the food items on the menu are not available The one thing I do love about this place is their sweet potato fries which is topped with brown sugar This is definately more of a bar snacks kind of place and not so much a sit down restaurant though they try And as far as bars go there are less expensive and better elsewhere in town 
insb5P4diPWqpRLIjPQC9A CMU a c u tradidtion since 1980 housed in the now defunct urbana courier newspaper building the courier cafe is a unique experience if you ve never been there quaint brick building with a corner entrance less than a mile from the U of I in downtown urbana check out things like their awesome salad bar green river phosphate other flavors too char broiled burgers or breakfast items like almond french toast great thick slices of bacon good coffee the dagwood sandwich or the veggie dagwood if you prefer for brunch today i had their basic breakfast plus oj coffee and nicked a piece of almond french toast off the plate next to mine ha ha thanks jane 5 of us met there we all used to work together 4 RN s 1 activity therapist had a blast reminiscing about the old Mercy Hospital where we all worked now Provena progress in motion whatever the courier rocks 
iNV-ZeWeeUe-8OQ0aUicwQ CMU I ve been to the Courier frequently and without bias I can say it is perhaps one of my favorite places to dine in all of Champaign Urbana Small local with plenty of great options for food Whether it s the Banker s Burger a Red Hot News sundae a green river phosphate any of their vegetarian dishes or even just the sweet potato chips the food is delicious and perfect each time all for a great low price and friendly service I ve never been ignored and always seem to have a full glass of water without even knowing they swung by The one thing that keeps Courier from being a super 5 star is if you re seated at anything other than a booth it seems like you re one inch away from being knocked about by any of the staff or other patrons Don t come if you have more than four people it ll be next to impossible to keep you all together However I think Courier s still a great cozy place to get your grub on 
IViQPbPTsFzEK-ebBkOKDQ CMU Went here for dinner Front room has a long bar and a few billiard tables Back room has seating for diners We were seated right away Large selection of microbrews by the bottle Crowd a mixture of families and students Enjoyed the hummus dip to start We had sandwiches I had a turkey reuben and the others had burgers Solid comfort food type dining 
IVNdNb2e0bYEMkNcFURtSw CMU I ve been here a few times I remember coming a few years ago to watch some NBA game and then more recently as a random stop with a few new friends I feel like it was night and day for me The service was terrible and I am a stickler for good service The kicker it wasn t even all that busy Food is standard bar food the drinks are alright I just hate having to track down people to get a simple order of a few beers I d hate to see what it looks like when it s really busy 
ixLFUjLzm5lo-6op0hIj1g CMU Courier has really darn good breakfast food My friend got the almond french toast It was light and delectable Especially good if you use orange marmalade instead of the syrup Try it I was really craving just your basic diner breakfast eggs bacon hash browns and toast Everything was right on I devoured almost all the food and that s pretty rare for me The hash browns were a particular stand out Crispy on the outside and almost creamy soft within Yum They bake all the bread in house and my toast was delish There s a case full of bakery style treats not sure if those were baked in house as well Eggs bacon and toast were all pretty good as well I was not disappointed with anything I ve yet to try the phosphates or milkshakes Combining flavors for a choc peanut butter shake has been on my mind lately tho My four stars are for breakfast only the three star holds for lunch dinner 
Iz-OWvMTvB80Xr9_sbD3Pg CMU Summer in Champaign is ALL about outdoor seating This great new restaurant has got it right With plenty of space out and inside and self seating the atmosphere is always semi casual and always welcoming After looking at the menu we expected an average dining experience based on the fact that the menu accentuates burgers they call their mini burgers SLIDERS and salads not our usual dining out fare However the wings are the BEST WINGS we have ever had in our lives They are not your usual buffalo drowned bits of suspiciously massive chook these are fine specimens of realistically sized expertly cooked bird served crispy with your choice of two sauces there are lots to choose from BBQ to Thai Peanut and beyond In ordering we found that each ordering the Slider Salad combo worked really well although sharing sliders and tasting different flavors also works well There is an extensive beer wine selection including some fashionable Spanish options however we seriously question a wine list without a single New Zealand option especially in the Sauvignon Blanc section Our favorite sliders so far have included the Buffalo Chicken the BlackJack the California Turkey and the Salmon although we highly recommend asking for NO BUTTER on the buns if you are interested in eating lightly Our two salads Goat Cheese and Spinach Fried Chicken Salad were both surprisingly delicious after so many below average iceberg salads in the mid west All in all we think they have found a niche targeting people who appreciate casual dining prepared exceptionally well This is the PERFECT OPTION for those diners who want a home town up scale alternative to Ruby Tuesday Steak n Shake Fridays or perhaps even Guido s at the same price and not at the mall Expect to spend 30 on food for 2 courses for 2 people 
iZjVbihxSb6HqkQuy6vGFA CMU I feel like Mugatu played by Will Ferrell in Zoolander watch it s only 5 secs of your life http www youtube com watch v AG7LjVCj50Y I am SO SURPRISED by the reviews here Did I come on a bad night This place was seriously bad I went there with a bunch of friends and it was just underwhelming Given the lack of customers service was pretty slow There were only a few menus for us to look at and the ones that we got were covered with crayon and torn but the waitress was nice My friends got the gazpacho but they said that it was fermented i e old I tried it and thought the same WTH I got the Courier burger simple bacon cheeseburger with fries The burger was huge but it was extremely dry like sandpaper dry I hate putting ketchup and mustard on a burger but I had to just to get the moisture back in my mouth The fries are NOT fries they re potato wedges Have you ever been to Mcdonalds Fries should look and taste like that Com on I then got The Headliner two scoops of ice cream with fudge peanuts whip cream and a cherry It was okay but nothing spectacular Joe Schmo who lives out in the dumpster could ve made it probably faster too Given that we were one of the few groups in the restaurant it took way too long to make it Courier Cafe is overrated 
j2hEcKQf7MC4k_5uouiAsw CMU Cannot count how many times I stumbled to this place after an all nighter or while up all night just having fun This is to put it mildly an institution Arguably the best breakfast place in the area and probably one of my top 3 breakfast places in the United States A fitting memorial to a fine local newspaper which folded in 1979 its all here the beautiful tin ceiling the wooden booths the memorabilia Staff is appropriately half hipster college kids half middle aged townies Always great coffee with rotating flavors and a fantastic breakfast menu that spans the gamut from the traditional to the funky and chic If you find yourself in Champaign Urbana Illinois there is simply no reason to eat breakfast anywhere else Curl up here with the New York Times and live like you are supposed to 
j5VHQl9faKdHTVmtY_yfnA CMU I picked this place because I thought it would be good for a group setting The people I traveled with had different dietary restrictions and I like to make sure I can cater to them all This place worked but the food was standard I definitely wasn t expecting mind blowing food but when it comes to a cafe I d like the food to be comforting My burger reminded me of a day at the park where you buy frozen burger patties from Costco and throw em on the grill Where s In and Out when I need them They also wouldn t cook my french fries extra crispy for some reason which was also another negative The highlight was probably the hot fudge sundae but as a reminder unless you like eating dessert as dinner share that sucker with someone I d go here again if I wanted something super casual and laid back But since I usually travel here with a band wagon of people I ll have to take them elsewhere 
j6sR8G4oygLwXju6qtxD8w CMU even with me being extremely picky about my meat my boy and i come back to this place time and time again and it is the go to place to take anyone from out of town i love the atmosphere of this place i ve gone on all nights of the week and i have never been there when it was too crowded or too loud the service has always been good especially when you sit at the bar i ve always had great recommendations from the servers for both beer and food their beer list is great tons of options on to the food i typically get the triple s deal you choose from salad soup slider and side and i get a salad i like the aisan salad and the blt salad sans bacon their waffle fries or sweet potato fries and then i substitute in a boca burger for one of their sliders the different sliders i ve tried have been good and the only complaint my boy had was with the brat slider said it just didn t feel right having a brat patty the flavors are always good and the portions are perfect the only thing i ve tried that i haven t liked are the cheese curds living in wisco for 4 years i have had my fair share of cheese curds and these just don t do it for me but some of my out of towners have said they don t mind them another perk is the prices without alcohol our bill was about 20 for 2 people with tax with alcohol for 2 our bill is between 30 50 depending on if we re having beer or hard alcohol so test it out and see what ya think but i m thinking you re gonna like it 
JBtYkj5h4-QseccusOmKAA CMU Courier Cafe is one of my favorite places in Urbana They have the best ice cream sundae in town THE MISPRINT Its small and the perfect size for desert And its under 4 I feel this is a great date place or conversation place because you could just order shakes and nothing else and stay for hours without being rushed out by wait staff They also have incredible shakes and rueben sandwiches 
jBZcJM5QzgWoZepaCv_WKw CMU Jillian s offered great football viewing for those of us with allegiances to teams outside the Midwest good bar entertainment options not so great food or service or beer wine selection but none of this matters much as they have CLOSED due to the emergence of downtown Champaign as the nightspot of choice to paraphrase the News Gazette article that announced the closure 
JekworiGhKgLxgUwPoCE_g CMU came here for a friend s birthday recently the food was alright just a bit too greasy and unoriginal as another dining companion put it they have good ideas but the execution was off the drink i ordered the maple leaf with canadian whiskey lemon and maple syrup was a bit too sweet i had to thin it out with water i ll most certainly be back but seven saints was certainly nothing to write home about 
jG4-L0Unteu1xPczYJayRQ CMU A place of childhood dreams The bread and potato wedges are very memorable Go for the peanut butter milkshakes too 
JgwJTBT1f0hm-2bg4H6dqQ CMU This is a relatively classy place not necessarily a college bar At least there was a fair mix of ages in here and nobody even gave me dirty looks when I cheered vociferously for Penn State against the Illini during a Saturday night game It was lively but not crowded They have dark red paint and cherry wood in here which individually are quite handsome but do not match well together In general though it s an attractive place with a mellow atmosphere One detraction the bathrooms are terrible far worse than you would expect given the rest of the establishment Service was friendly and attentive from our two waitresses The first one could not name the bar s whiskeys besides Jameson Jack Jim Crown thankfully I ended up with Woodford Reserve but give her credit for at least knowing what whisk e y is you d be surprised 
Jie4zsdNdA1Iaicz6Cc-MQ CMU Highlights Expresso Royale Bar table and lounge seating Wireless Study areas Relaxed Clean Comfortable Quiet Recycling Water Restrooms Friendly people MTD accessible Newly remodeled Awesome landmark 
JQCZpCi4RrFt_NmPBOu-hg CMU If you ever feel the need for ill prepared food in a funeral home esque atmosphere this place is for you The last time I was here it was when a visiting scholar was in town so someone got the bright idea of bringing her here We loaded up our plates with watery cottage cheese and wilted lettuce and sat down The conversation kind of mimicked the food bland and predictable Maybe you ll have better luck but man I thought this was just about the worst place on campus to eat See my review for the Krannert cafe which is at least do able 
k1CdmyNWPSZcNX87ON8dJw CMU The food is good but not great However the tomato bisque soup is available daily and it is absolutely fabulous 
Kb9kg-qGIcjDdiEFLdBtWg CMU You here a lot of great things about this place and I think that was the issue for me I had pretty high expectations Don t get me wrong we liked our experience the food was tasty and made to order and the service was solid We went for a late lunch so the atmosphere was dead and seeing the older restaurant left nothing to the imagination But there was nothing GREAT about this place in the same light there was nothing bad either It s worth to check it out and I will be back to give it another shot 
kdcbCYSuPN47HwPnBhnGTw CMU Hands down one of my favorite places in CU The prices are very fair the food is good they offer a nice variety and the atmosphere is fantastic The shakes are well worth every last one of the million or so calories they contain Minus one star because they don t handle carry out very well I ve never had an order get mixed up when eating in but there s about a 30 chance of a screw up when getting carry out To the credit of the manager when I brought this to his attention he was really apologetic personally verified that my order was correct and gave me my next meal on the house So they get the star back 
KJBMRgCrF90YIQCIHnxTQw CMU I have to agree with those holding the OVER Rated opinion The best thing about Crane Alley is the drinkin They have loads of beer selection the bar is well stocked and we all got a little over appreciative of their fine scotch selections The food and service though both left much to be desired They serve typical pub food with some updates twists Beet chips Why not Our apps were all ok not great The service was slow like stuck in tar slow Everything here is on the expensive side Go for a night of trying different brews liquors eat somewhere tastier before heading over 
KJRwNkylraT6tAwl5onGMw CMU I went to Courier Cafe today with Mr Boyfriend and two of our friends Overall we had a good experience Pros Service The cafe was fairly busy but we were seated right away and we all had water glasses within a couple minutes Our waitress was friendly attentive and very patient If I could rate service separately it would be a 5 star rating Decor I like it The theme seems to be old timey newspaper which is pretty cool Milkshake Mr Boyfriend and I got a peanut butter to split and our friends got butterscotch Awesome The Skinny Dippers crispy fried potato skins covered with cheese bacon sour cream and chives These will make a person anything but skinny We got a half order to split and ended up with approximately a bazillion potato skins Wow Food in general pretty good Menu Quaintly themed with desserts named after newspaper stuff Headliner Misprint Cub Reporter etc Standard American fare sandwiches burgers etc Cons Almost Cons Slight Issues Price It wasn t terribly overpriced for being right in downtown Urbana I m willing to pay 5 75 for a BLT I just want the BLT to be a great BLT The BLT was a good BLT but it was a 4 BLT Tiny slice of tomato lots of lettuce some decent bacon on basic slices of wheat bread The skins were 4 95 and these are SO worth it to split with a group because of how good they are and how many we received Milkshake was 3 75 I believe Altogether Mr Boyfriend spent around 30 before tip for the two of us Timing We arrived at 12 10 ordered by 12 15 and were served at 12 45 I had to be back at work by 1 so I had hoped the food would come out more quickly This isn t a terrible wait and like I said the restaurant was doing good business Still I had ten minutes to eat but 30 to talk I would rather have 30 minutes to savor those potato skins and ten minutes to talk to the jerks I call friends but you can t always get what you want 
KkHHgEJGwuRKfrAZwTZCRA CMU I do love you Jimmy John s but when you tell me that I have to pay for a water glass after 10pm to go with my sandwich that is a joke The cashier laughed as asked for a water glass and he said it would be 1 50 Are you serious There are other more worthy late night places than this location 
KNu70bo9rrsHAhS0UBgYxQ CMU This place closed a couple of years ago 
kOBovcSY-unZmL2_iP-ZjQ CMU Like nifty c I just do not understand the love I ve perhaps gone once for breakfast and then two years later once for lunch and absolutely nothing I ate inspired me to return In fact I can t even remember what I ve had there it was so unmemorable I m guessing that I had at least the hash browns because I am always in search of perfect hash browns but I can make much better from freshly grated potatoes at home without the sinking feeling of disappointment to accompany them 
L-NG7aU5DVu1eOwD2fNvNQ CMU So far my lady and I have only been here for Ice Cream but we will be returning for other meals As far as the Ice Cream goes the best I ve had in years The closest thing to a proper Ice Cream Parlor that I know of in the area 
L01G5k3L9xrM334Uh9UnxA CMU I refuse to go to TGI Friday s in Champaign anymore I ve been here around 4 times and it s just not worth it For the price there are lots of other places to get a good meal in the area I m very forgiving when it comes to service I know that servers and waitstaff have a demanding job and I tip well even for mediocre service However truly bad service is inexcusable I came with a couple of friends and ordered a frozen margarita When my drink was brought out the server spilled the entire drink all over me This isn t what bothers me At another restaurant I d be totally willing to forgive and forget It happens Her reaction was what soured the experience She gave me a half hearted insincere apology and brought me out two extra napkins Mind you the full drink was all over my lap and running down my leg not a two napkin fix I asked for more napkins and it took a couple minutes but she did come back She offered to make a new drink but I told her to forget it and bring me an iced tea She did and the meal was fine The food is alright but nothing spectacular I had a cheeseburger and fries and it was pretty good I liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit The real shock came at the end of the meal We had separate checks and not only was I never offered a discount or compensation for the server s mistake but she tried to charge me for the margarita I ve had waiters slip up elsewhere and while I don t think it s necessary to offer a discount it sure is appreciated especially when I ve spent nearly an hour eating my meal and covered in sticky cold margarita through no fault of my own A manager eventually came over to speak with me about the bill and he ended up comping our appetizer and my iced tea Still the server s poor attitude ruined what could have been a pleasant evening out I won t be back 
l51G7G0uKFh1Ue_V8wla2A CMU The sliders here are great I ve tried the hawaiian the tuna the bbq black blue and I ve really enjoyed all of them I usually order a slider with a small salad and their salads are really filling Ordering a few different sliders is a great way to try different flavors in one sitting you don t have to commit to one giant burger They have great service and good beer here to Great place to start a night at 
l8tWv3BtualuxGOKWMfeCw CMU Very nice and relaxed off campus bar They have a huge room with pool tables darts and of course very big TV s If you can t make it to a football game or want to watch the Illini basketball team win this is the place to go The food is pretty good too 
lFYeXQjcpgz-fQgVLEyrMQ CMU very little to complain about with TGI Fridays i am always able to get an item that is no longer on the menu blackened Cajun chicken sandwich and the menu is constantly changing Always worth a visit a few times a month 
Lh6FC7R3_ACKSm6xMRonTA CMU This is a bar restaurant with a large beer list and a menu which consists of mostly bar food items Though fried the cheese curd appetizer was a nice opener A variety of sliders were available and when combined with a shared appetizer and a soup or salad presented more than enough food to satisfy us 
LjP35B7N7jzjGibptgtcwQ CMU a little pricey but their chili is the best in the city Lunch specials are always a welcome treat as well Try to make it here at least once in a while 
Lm_FVx6d8H4xt8M7BYDr_w CMU great burgers and great beers Even though this place is close to the campus its far enough a way from the regular places the kids go so that is not too loud and rambunctious even on St Paddy s Day The Burger really was absolutely great even cooked to Medium Well it was so juicy that the first bite left a puddle of flavor on the plate oh yeah which then got soaked up by their great french fries AND they have Rouge s Kell s Irish Lager on Tap and man is that tasty Great service too and the prices were just right 
lOFKI6a8PG_oOLaX5SXH6w CMU Corned Beef Hash and Eggs is the house specialty I m told and it didn t disappoint Also friendly house staff you will always feel like family in this place Just a quaint respite from the days travels ahead 
lR3y4U4gxTQ8JCntnHxM0A CMU I love coming here for Whiskey Wednesdays Every week they pick a category of whiskey to be half off They have a great selection and usually some off menu specials They really know their whiskey so this is a great place to try something new of you have discriminating taste This is possibly my favorite feature of any bar in the area They always have a nice selection of beer on tap too at a nice range of prices and have recently started Brewsdays with some nice beer specials Seven Saints has some quality food too Sliders salads sides desserts It s all delicious Definitely try the sweet potato fries or beet chips My only complaint about the menu is that since I tend to order vegetarian the options can get a little stale though you can sub in a veggie burger on any of their sliders My favorite meal California Turkey Slider sub a veggie burger hold the bacon waffle fries and the Southwest Chipotle Salad And last but not least the atmosphere Seven Saints feels classy but not so classy that you ll feel underdressed if you show up in a t0shirt and jeans It s a darker feel and the furniture and decorations are detailed and thought out Even when it s busy they bar doesn t get too terribly loud so it s great for a date or a night out with friends if you d like to be able to have a conversation at the table 
LRyFc23MWZOmanerueMCtw CMU I came to Seven Saints on a Wednesday night having learned they would be offering scotch at half price As I ve always wanted to get into scotch and thought I d give it a try When I grabbed a seat at the bar one of the bartenders cheerfully greeted me went through the specials and gave me some menus I was pleasantly surprised to learn that half price offer wasn t limited to a few selections but rather ALL scotch Food While the food selections were nothing innovative within sandwiches salads soups and gourmet sliders but they offer a pretty wide variety of each It seemed like the price of a meal ran from about 7 50 10 which is a pretty fair price I ordered a BBQ and Asian sliders with some sweet potato fries and was also pleasantly surprised this was not your typical White Castle sliders My meal arrived in good time and was quite yummy and filling Drink Not really knowing what to order I took the suggestion of their featured scotch being a Finalta Glenmorangie It was pretty tasty and for half price at 6 you can t go wrong Per additional suggestion I also tried a Springbank a French Oaked scotch and a Lagavulin which I was told represented the different regions and styles of scotch I was happy with the size of each pour and the bar was generally pretty quick to refill my water Service Although it seemed to be a busy each of my bartenders Zack and Rick approached me as often as they could kept my drinks filled and happily took time to answer my questions about scotch They were very informative charismatic and hilarious Ambiance The place has a sort of an old gothic feel to it which I found neat Everyone seemed to be dressed in casual to business casual and the entire atmosphere was pretty laid back with great music selection The staff was friendly everyone else sitting at the bar seemed nice and were happy to shoot some brief conversation Overall I really enjoyed myself at Seven Saints Flawless on my first try with drinks food and service I ll definitely come back for another night of whiskey 
LtNLGI2XMuJYnumebCMrUA CMU My teammates and I tried doing as many different places for lunch while on assignment in town and of all the places we did we found ourselves here the most I can honestly say that we did not have a single bad meal here The tomato pesto grilled cheese is amazing Their lunch combos are just the perfect amount of food All of the soups were tasty my favorite was probably the Italian Wedding Nice atmosphere and consistently good service would return if ever in the area again 
ltxah_mdnH-K2IdNej3udw CMU Closed 
lUgZwVYJdTXcIFzIKa8uiw CMU I ve been a couple times and on my most recent trip was pretty darn satisfied Yes there are finer restaurants in CU yes there are cheaper bars and yes there are better crowds however I sure enjoyed the hell out of my last trip Here s why they have an excellent liquor selection with a focus on Irish Scotch and Bourbon Whiskies Their food menu has a nice balance of innovation and old standards and was well executed for everything our group of 6 ordered Service is quick turn and burn baby even when they re full If you are careful the food and drink is actually quite reasonably priced soup sandwich combo 2x beers huge club with excellent sweet potato fries all for 30 whiskey tab was a different story but worth it You certainly could spend more on you food here but if you get the cheap stuff you will still be happy Also on Wednesdays they have HALF price on all their whisky ey The bartender also runs classes on the appreciation of this complex but enthralling some would even say intoxicating beverage 
lX1CSs9TA55AkVnrDlm_pA CMU This place has killer nachos and usually pretty good servers Lots of eye candy abounds My usual place to watch sports Former Coke bottling plant building in town tastefully redone 
L_MJJjhfvxQNQ-HhOAdkqA CMU While I had been to this place before and it was passable I made the mistake of going on some Jose Cuervo day when downtown Champaign was all blocked off Even worse I took my family Tiny overpriced menu with heated up pulled pork on a grocery store bun Chips on the side More than 7 My dad asked for a bottle of Miller Lite they brought him a draft without checking if it was alright and charged him for a bottle anyway Inattentive waitress despite the place being full of workers we were left waiting a long time for pretty much anything we wanted Truly awful I will never be there again Extorting your customers and ignoring their requests is not a good way to get repeat business 
m-qqZ-c4GeW74EHfjJwT9A CMU I remember a time when this place was called R R s and there was the legendary Sharkbowl This place got a face lift and now it s called Firehaus Now they ve replaced it with the fishbowl which is a much smaller fruitier version of the sharkbowl Oh well There isn t much room for dancing but I like how there is no cover for 21 It also is a college scene but it s one redeemable aspect is that the people are pretty good looking 
mJyXCrfm_3a1S4Sru4o9bQ CMU Crane Alley is the only bar I go to in Urbana and has the best bottled beer menu of any bar in the area In addition it will have more than 10 draft beers at any one time from various microbreweries and craft breweries The reasons to stop by don t stop there since there is also a fairly extensive menu of tavern style food which is higher quality than what one usually comes across My favorite appetizer is Crane Alley s signature beet chips Every table around us got this appetizer since it is one of the dishes that Crane Alley is most known for The beet chips come with a bowl of a goat cheese dip which has cream cheese mixed in The dip is somewhat rich and heavy and helps to bulk up what might otherwise be a rather light appetizer The sandwiches at Crane Alley run up to around 10 and the main courses a bit higher than that Last visit my girlfriend got a portabella mushroom burger which was one of the daily specials and of course had no meat However it was bulky enough to offset that and not be as light and unfilling as a lot of vegetarian food ends up being I got a beer battered fish sandwich which was crispy and fairly large way too much fish for the bun along with the sweet potato fries another thing Crane Alley is known for One of the complaints I usually have about fried fish sandwiches is how greasy they are but luckily this sandwich didn t fall into that trap The primary lure that Crane Alley has is its wide selection of beers and drinks which can be ordered alongside a selection of appetizers or food something some local competitors do not offer In addition it has weekly special dishes and daily specials and special beer and food pairings on set dates tickets must usually be purchased I would highly recommend anyone in the area or at the university make the effort to stop here at least once 
mruCbb3pjDxy7Zy6ybJMTg CMU In general I like Guidos They have a good selection of bottled beer and it s reasonably priced I think their food is fine I ve taken my dad there before and we ve definitely had worse meals in CU over the years Hell I even think that some of their martinis are better than those at Boltini blasphemy right The bartenders have always been very nice but I had one interaction with a waitress that was less than ideal I ordered La Fin du Monde she brought me Lindeman s Framboise I pointed out the error they re polar opposites of the bottled alcohol spectrum I didn t want to pay 8 for raspberry stuff and she made a comment about how it s not like they could give it to someone else trend in DT champaign But she did bring me the right beer after I questioned her initial decision Overall I like going there to play pool on the quiet nights on the weekends I d rather go somewhere else 
MsLJ7_7VuOUpVCU6iykztQ CMU I am torn over what to do with Seven Saints When I first went there I thought the food was great and the drinks were wonderful Over time it has lost its luster What follows is my progression My first visit was mostly about the drinks I found the beer menu to be decent which is what I felt like drinking that night I know I ordered food and I was not displeased with it Overall my first experience was good and I came back for more My next visit included food and drinks I went with some sort of mixed drink that tasted fine but was not memorable I had the salmon slider to eat I did not notice if the menu listed what came with the slider or not and the waitress did not bother to mention that the slider come with just the sandwich When I got my slider I realized that one mini sized salmon sandwich was not going to be enough for dinner Sadly I started eating the slider before I ordered more food I can only describe it as a salty salmon puck After that I was no longer hungry and we went elsewhere I returned for lunch and had the BLT salad with the tomato soup I recommend both options The soup was so good that I came back for lunch again and paired it with the tomato pesto grilled cheese This was also wonderful In fact it was so good that I found myself craving the soup and grilled cheese one day so I went for lunch Now I am not a fan of swiss cheese which is one of the cheeses in the sandwich I requested that the swiss cheese be replaced with provolone instead When I got my sandwich there was no swiss cheese but there was no other cheese on the sandwich There should have been American cheese as well I guess the server misunderstood my request and I figured it was an honest mistake so I didn t think it was a big deal The last straw was yesterday I went for lunch again and ordered the tomato pesto grilled cheese with the tomato soup Again I requested that the swiss be replaced with provolone When I got my sandwich it was more like toast than a grilled cheese There was one slice of American cheese and one slice of provolone cheese on each piece of bread but the cheese was not melty and gooey It was toasted and crispy Then the pesto was glopped on in one cold dollop I found the sandwich to be dry From now on I will probably only go to this place for the drinks Too bad I can find drinks at just about any bar in town I feel let down because I really wanted to like this place I love the look and feel of the bar and it has all the potential to be great However if they can t even accomplish a grilled cheese sandwich why would you want to eat their food 
mTWz1did2_9yPfzqbuKn_w CMU If you are in the mood for nachos head here Of course many other reviewers make good points it s a weird crowd it can be really loud etc All true But the nachos are pretty delicious 
MVYFfIbQ3wApW2AV3LQXNA CMU The restaurant ambiance is very nice especially when it isn t packed to the gills and you can sit in their booth Very standard menu of old traditional American diner standbys with a nice salad bar I would often do the soup and salad thing here Of special note the milkshakes are great probably the best in town That said I must admit that the food isn t top notch and I am sometimes disappointed by their burgers sandwiches etc 
nBy4Q6QLGAFI2EMJTNAsnw CMU Ok the food s better than edible It s good mostly The service though has always been indifferent if not leaning to rude However I ll probably go back again when I m in Urbana and hungry But I ve lowered my expectations 
nD5k85Kjx_behlR3eehRzg CMU Alright Courier We meet again I ve gone a few more times and your staff has upped its game even the older gentleman in the front is a LOT nicer I ve come here 2 3 times late on a Saturday night just to read and they don t give me a hard time and keep the coffee coming And yes it is all about those shakes No seriously It is They re delicious and you can combine flavors Sometimes I leave my house to go for the 20 minute walk for a milkshake It brings this boy to the cafe 
nDpu36r_i4KTp0aS7wu9HA CMU This is one of the best hidden gems in Urbana Located in downtown Urbana Courier Cafe has an old classical cafe feel and decoration I don t know to describe to be Old Victorian but it is old school for sure The seats are all wood wooden floors dim lighting classic wooden benches and there is even an old school cash register Definitely a blast in the past to the early 20th century Very classy and clean place that had a warm home feeling The food What can I say AMAZING It is just simple American home cooking I have had just about everything from the awesome burgers which come in a ton of different ways steak sandwich soups deep fried shrimp most of the pies and the sundaes Best of all it s all fairly cheap The service was also awesome I went here with a large party of nearly 20 people and I went here with just 3 Both times the service was amazing There is this elderly guy there with glasses and he is just very nice funny and personable to us every time I have made this a regular place for me to go when I am in the Urbana Champaign area 
nFJ8BbfC_Nx1ND-csOIwuQ CMU I definitely like Jimmy John s It s my favorite place to pick up a snack in between classes I like simple sandwiches and Jimmy John does some great cheap simple sandwiches Their slims no veggies or sauce on the menu are only 3 25 plus I can pick up a 14 piece of day old bread for like 0 50 and I ve got myself a full meal for like 4 I can t complain about that The staff have always been really friendly I think they re forced to sort of yell Hello and Catch you later as you enter and leave the shop But they sound sincere enough so I ll say that s a good thing for them to do But no complaints here However I can t really complain about nothing and give it 4 stars so Analyzing their pricing a little more carefully I discovered that for 0 75 more you can go over to subway when they re doing the 5 footlongs and get like 3 4 more inches of sandwich for 75 cents more I did some calculating You d save 12 cents an inch of sandwich by doing this Over your college career that d be approximately 240 assuming an average consumption of 2 sandwiches week for 4 school years Just some food for thought Luckily Jimmy John s gives me a 1 off for not getting veggies which brings me to about 1 cent inch cheaper than subway so I don t have to make that decision 
nF_pR4QBP4C_d13Em5kNLw CMU Having been here on several occasions I would definitely recommend Courier Cafe If wanting to try it go for breakfast They have a good selection and I personally recommend one of the omelets To finish you must try one of the delicious milkshakes that they have You will not be disappointed I have also heard that their fountain sodas are excellent In terms of service I have had my ups and downs but mostly good At times I have had to wait to checkout at the front counter which has been an annoyance The location is nicely located near downtown Urbana away from campus The ambiance is nice and there always seems to be a diverse customer base Compared to other breakfast options in Champaign Urbana this would have to be one of my favorites far superior to many of the other chain and diners 
NhXTh9Wfm33c6-qn8cOksA CMU I love this place my sister first turned me onto it when we were both students in the 80 s first of all it s incredibly cheap 7 95 for lunch dessert soda and coffee the students who work here are all on the work study program so you should definitely tip them well considering the food is so cheap and these kids can really use the dough the architecture in here is awesome mostly faculty staff are dining here so be prepared to see your professors if you are a student or your colleagues if you re a worker bee the food is actually quite good you can make a super salad with actual dark green leaves and some nice additives they always have nice vegetarian options for entrees and soup as well this is a great place to meet a group and really feel collegiate 
NJGOKa6uZyyeG3DohpYQzw CMU We love the Courier My family eats there more than we eat at home The staff is wonderful the food is great I highly recommend the Rueben sandwich The best in the state 
NlHea0bfh-tHwOVhog4cqg CMU At Seven Saints the extremely dim lighting was quite flattering to my features but horrible for doing homework the oldies tunes streaming from the speakers were super fantastic and chill the server was very attentive yet my Rogue Dead Guy Ale tasted watered down All of my other brews were quite good though 
NnYMzVxx3shSJMbsQCPXxQ CMU My wife and in went here about six months ago The fact that we have not been back since then probably implies something We had some pretty darn good onion rings for an appetizer My wife had a Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese sandwich that we thought was pretty good along with a nice Tomato Bisque I had a trio of Sliders Asian Tropical Stack and Salmon served with Sweet Potatoe Fries I grew up in an area that had White Castle restaurants Now I never went there unless pressed but I do know what a slider is The problem with these was not the taste which was fine Nor the size which was small The problem is that sliders are moist greasy Now I m not saying that having a non greasy slider is a bad thing from a healthful eating perspective But if you re going to call something a slider there has to be something non dry about it sigh Service was friendly I would like to get back there and try some other items but we always seem to think of someplace else we d rather eat 
np9qRelccZlHsG5q4t2JSA CMU Nice breakfast place Friendly staff and nice food 
NsurS7rLvA9X3CFrtNoDpQ CMU Other than ZAS this was my favorite place to eat They have the best food in town The pesto pizza was amazing and so are the milkshakes I would agree with Ellen that there is a lot of comfort food here There is almost always a wait to get in here but it s well worth it They also have a great salad bar that you can create your own salad and then pay per pound It s amazing 
NuZQaSNtQSO583gXMXAeIg CMU This is such a great place to go when you are sick of all of the places to eat on campus I think I loved this place from the moment I walked in and saw that they use the same chairs that my parent s have around their kitchen table The atmosphere is very homey So the food Obviously the shakes are amazing but so are their sandwiches My favorite is the grilled swiss and pesto on sour dough with sweet potato fries They also have a big salad bar in the back and you pay for your salad by weight They have pretty interesting combinations and the price is just right 
NYuFnHAsGB1mYcPsOZ1XTw CMU The sliders are good and they have decent selection of draft beers including Rogue Dead Guy The asian slider is average because the wasabi mayo could have used a little more of the wasabi The smokey bacon cheese slider was awesome for a person who likes to be kicked in the teeth with flavor crispy bacon smokey BBQ sauce smoked cheddar My wife ordered the coup de grace the tropical slider with grilled pineapple and thai peanut sauce Since you might order 2 or 3 sliders anyway this one is well worth trying 
O43pjStj8Ii7sDwkPrYP2w CMU the first time i came to crane alley i had trouble finishing my beer in the smoke haven that is the outside seating section of the bar i m pretty sure i nearly died that night the second time i came i ordered one of their incredibly over priced martinis and it tasted like triaminic no joke when i told the server that it was awful he brought me some sprite to put in it and said it was all he could do believe it or not the sprite made it soooo much worse luckily my face was so contorted with the bad taste it convinced the server to go against bar policy and bring me something else i had to pay for my new drink but luckily he took the first one off my tab the third time i came i had the potato pancakes and fell in love yumyumyum in summation crane alley is a good place i always go back but like many places in urbana and champaign its can be a hit or miss you just have to be willing to take the chance i would however stick with the large and in charge beer menu and the more common mixed beverages the martinis are way over priced and i just never every want to taste triaminic spiked with vodka again thankyoumuch 
ObmSLkXdaRu5Jg3dnsUT0Q CMU If Ii were to get one chance at ordering a coffee or a chocolate milkshake I would order it from Courier Cafe Even though it s an old fashioned kind of spot as in old carpet old er waitresses who may or may not be friendly and old silverware But there s nothing like a good old fashioned milkshake that s too think to get through a straw and comes with the overflow in the metal mixing cup Even on a cold winter day I ll make my way over to the Courier Cafe Any self respecting milkshake connoisseur might do the same 
OEW7kK7dAxuCZBbnAIA_hw CMU I like the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich here I also like the selection of beers and flights Real chill place to go and kick it with some buddies or to start off a night 
OihDyaI-PjK4WCiZy6giFw CMU This place is very good I like going for breakfast and lunch The best thing is their potato skins which arent all that good for you but the taste makes up for that really fast 
OiqvIKKz0hDeONZvoBBS-A CMU This place is terrible Nice location Terrible atmosphere and service If you feel like hanging out with the service staff and their friends and feel like you are at a party where you don t know anyone and you are not welcomed if you like to pay more than you should for your food and drinks then you got to go to Guido s 
OjoBfonPhviNKS_PyWGSjA CMU The food at Firehaus is pretty excellent I love that you can get the burgers on pretzel buns and the Firehaus fries are the greatest thing ever I ve never had trouble with the service either One time I was given the employee discount because the waitress kept forgetting about us but if she did I certainly never noticed I do wish the kitchen was open later though The Firehaus fries are 3 99 on Fridays but even though the kitchen is supposed to close at 10 if I get there past 9 30 it s already too late I don t have too much experience with the nightlife here but it seems pretty crowded when I go to get my fries Whether that s a good or bad thing is up to you but it was kind of a pain that I couldn t hear any of my friends from across the table I ve been there a few times earlier in the week when it s less crowded and it s been pretty enjoyable Last word of advice avoid the amaretto stone sours Unless the person making mine messed something up it just wasn t good It was bland and syrupy 
okt554uXdUKwHPUaMttjNg CMU We tried Courier Cafe on the recommendation of a friend and were happy we did This is a delightful little restaurant done up in turn of the century decor with fun antiques and pieces from that time period We were in for breakfast this morning I was told to go early or wait and I m glad we arrived before 8 am as there was a line when we left an hour later Service here is cheerful friendly and professional and both the hostess and waitress greeted us when we entered We skipped the homemade pastries and muffins as they re not on the diet right now but they looked great I had an omelet with spinach mushrooms and cheddar and it was very good with very fresh veggies The hash browns they serve are delicious crispy without and fluffy within They make their own bread and I tried the cinnamon toast which was a white bread that my baker husband says was brioche dough and made for some great toast He tried the oatmeal with fresh berries and walnuts which was made with whole oats The regular size is a very good sized serving of oats you can get a half order if you re appetite is smaller I asked of they use real butter I ll order my toast dry before I ll eat margarine and she assured me they do which I greatly appreciate Two thumbs way up for this delish breakfast I ll be back for lunch 
OnKqHJX_88rx4y3KwAUonQ CMU On the west wall between the bar and the bathrooms before you enter the hall is a framed handwritten letter from Hugh Hefner thanking Bunny s for all the fun times he had there and acknowledging it is the inspiration for the Playboy Bunny I dunno about you but I think that s pretty cool 
OpYZYemwk6qufE3jG-bjFw CMU Meh typical college bar Maybe I m getting old and this would have suited me when I was in college but I can t see anything that would make me choose this over any other place like Murphy s 
oUG_iDmTP_nKYQNxtz80IA CMU This is one of my favorite places to grab dinner and drinks with friends but only when I have a lot of time on my hands The food is good and the prices are on the high side of fair The problem is the service Really slow and with an attitude no matter when you go or who your server bartender is They seem unable to handle a crowd of more than about 3 tables without the staff having a melt down I go because I like the food they have a good beer list and the place is quiet enough that you can actually talk to the people you re with It s a really nice place to kill a few hours and catch up with old friends 
OVQ6N-nRtsYkwvJVajM0nw CMU Tuna melt is also very good I get cravings for their tuna melt 
o_xqtop5Kyx97QEHXVw_4w CMU Dear Courier Cafe I know you re a fabulous place cozy sweet with your antique accents old timey cash register and high wooden booths I know you have friendly and skilled servers that have been happily working there for years who ask if you want separate checks before you even order I know your food is delicious and eclectic with your amazing packed salad bar and uniquely named menu items like the Monkey Stuff sandwich with bananas peanut butter shredded coconut and honey or your Rancheros Rarebit the over stuffed breakfast burrito doused in red sauce or even simply the Paperboy Courier or Morning Edition breakfasts of eggs toast hash browns and choices of meats and fixin s You carry baked goods like powdered sugar topped brownies gigantic cookies and breads such as the Bubby Bun I know this I know that you can make me a super sundae loaded with nuts and fruity goodies or a Green River Phosphate with whipped cream foaming over the side of my frosty mug I know that you have a different flavored coffee offered every day of the week in addition to your regular and decaf and I know that you sell bags of each flavor so that we may enjoy them at home any time we want I know all of these things So why is it that every time I think of you and your wonderful establishment you won t be leaving us any time soon I am sure the one thing that comes to mind again and again is your hand dipped peanut butter shake Sometimes I wonder if I should have malt or chocolate added to compliment the peanut butter but I always go back to just plain peanut butter I don t even care if you forget the whipped cream although you never do Just give me the peanut butter blended smoothly into the vanilla ice cream in a frosty mug or a foam to go cup and I am elated I will wait and wait how ever long it takes because I know people line up to partake of your fabulous fare just to take that first satisfying sip and slip into a frosty bit of heaven And thank you thank you for always making a little too much so that you have to bring out the metal shaker with the extra shake bits for sharing with my friends Because you know it s very difficult to want to share this with anyone There is one more thing I know I will always be back to visit you every time I m in town Because I do Thank you Courier Cafe Love Clarissa J 
P4oSqV5oGJVnnJZEe_08Hg CMU This place is just wonderful Even though the bar is usually packed the service and the wait staff are always friendly Andy the GM is always around and making sure everyone is happy and enjoying themselves If there ever was a problem he d do whatever it takes to make it right The food is excellent and the bartenders really know their stuff about drinks and they make wonderful recommendations I highly suggest visiting on Wednesday nights for their Whiskey Wednesdays I really recommended this bar because of its atmosphere service and quality drinks food 
Pgqd5IcsU6MhNUYuvSKTGg CMU Delicious amazing eclectic food choices A favorite for me and my boyfriend and a million other people because the place is always crowded though there is never a long wait for a table I wish more people went to this place because I think it really needs to be supported more by university kids 
PIbbHKojqqWlb7ZLr13lrg CMU Great for kickin it and watching a hockey game with your friends This place is sprawling with an upstairs another upstairs and a patio outside I went during the summer when it was full but not crowded The service was blas but available 
ppALnrVf47IhLwnl79_yTw CMU Servers are wonderfully friendly there are approximately 8 974 beers available the drink selection is broad and the bar is huge and several of the sandwiches and appetizers are delicious When your e there do try the potato pancakes in a light cheese cream sauce OMG it tastes like magic i might be exaggerating but only slightly 
pr5eqD14_aPbuZc30RuQEA CMU I love Courier Cafe s salad bar it has absolutely everything you could ever put on a salad Salad bars aren t as popular or common as they were 30 years ago but I am still a fan I ve tried other things on their menu and enjoyed them the desserts are excellent I like the Victorian decor too 
pUTnB8VSVqjCpkGZ3WvyFQ CMU Dessert Do it I hear breakfast is pretty awesome as well Decor is cool neat vibe old historical building When I was a kid we had Farrell s no longer in the Bay Area for our sweet treats and for whatever reason the sundae I had reminded me of that Points for nostalgia 
q7LlT84AkXJwoadj_fslCg CMU This is not a place to write home about for the food but the daily drink specials are key I dont remember them all but Tuesdays are 4 dollar LIT s Thursdays are 2 dollar coors lite and miller lite bottles and sundays are 5 dollar coors light pitchers Obviously I could only remember the ones that appeal to me They also have two dart boards and two pool tables I havent been there when it s crowded or when there are frat boys So for me it was a place where you can chat with the friendly bartenders play some pool darts and choose my own music from the juke box 
Q8j9Ldfzza9WHWHI3B61Zg CMU guidos has really good french fries REALLY REALLY GOOD like sneak them off your husband s plate when he s in the bathroom even though you already have your own good but remember all those people you hated in high school the ones you figured would join a fraternity or sorority to try and legitimize the fact that they are drunk mentally disturbed and semi literate remember how you thought they d all still be acting like jack asses in their thirties well you were right and i promise you they are hanging out at guidos right now with five hundred of their best friends 
q8l_q0KyBn32qHvfpRPH-Q CMU I used to work here in college along with the Interlude bar and Catering dept Good times were had here behind the register We always made coffee fresh each shift Coffee and soda are cheap Best bet for a good meal is to get a sandwich we made those fresh to order dinners are just microwaved In the daytime there s an assortment of baked goods at night it s just cakes pies If it s going to be a busy night and you want food make sure to go early to get a table and get your food in time as there will be a long line Tip if you want something to eat during intermission place your orders ahead of time and it will be waiting for you at a reserved table when you get out Only desserts and drinks are available after the show ends There s a parking lot underneath that used to be free and street parking in the neighborhood is usually easy 
QatPaefcwnE2tPbpx7H5yg CMU Good daily specials I feel like this place is just a typical sports bar on campus a dime a dozen I m starting to get used to the super cheap alcohol in Champaign that the specials here only get one star This place isnt that special besides the fact that it s oh so close to my building The waitress was slow literally and mentally She took forever AND messed up our bill I guess she s forgiven because she s cute but geez 
qcg6Vfk70qLL_Grpr45dcw CMU waitresses in skin tight mini dresses check all the townie mid 90 s uiuc frat alum check waiting forever to get your bill being subsequently charged twice on your card having to deal with your bank to get said charge reversed because the manager at guidos can t be bothered to call you back check check and check the drinks are standard the food is fair the experience is forgettable accept when you get your credit card statement then you are reminded sometimes twice 
QcxgKF4sHmlACdLlx38BrQ CMU This is one of my favorite local restaurants in CU First of all the atmosphere is really amazing A lot of care was taken to make the inside of this place something special It has a slightly dark gothic feel yet it still feels very cozy and inviting I do wish the space was a bit bigger however as it can get busy very quickly and you ll run out of places to sit Service wise I ve almost always had great service The wait staff is friendly and the bartenders are fast and responsive They have a nice selection of spirits The best part has to be the food though They have a nice selection of salads My absolute favorite is the Seven Saints Salad I ve never tasted anything quite like it It has a crisp bed of greens topped with tiny hot green peppers and a VERY generous portion of pieces of steak The steak is flavorful and moist and the whole salad has a clear dressing that compliments the other components perfectly The best part is that you can have the salad as part of a special served with a couple of their sliders for around 8 It s a great deal Speaking of their sliders they have a really wonderful selection of mini hamburgers They aren t as heavily greasy as you might expect from a traditional slider My favorites are probably the Asian slider with it s wasabi spread the Buffalo Chicken slider with an amazing sauce on a crispy piece of chicken and served with ranch dip and the Blacjack burger There are a ton more and pretty much anything to suit your taste Another standout aspect of Seven Saints are their appetizers If I have one complaint it s that they seem incapable of keeping their Beet Chips ready to order Out of the five times I ve tried to order them I ve only ever been able to get them twice I don t know if I ve just had bad timing or what but I do wish they were a bit more diligent with those If you do manage to order them they are delicious and are served with a yummy goat cheese dip If they are out of them there are still a lot of great options You can t go wrong with either of their mushroom appetizers 
qJnjPNWWIy6Evq0LD5Biuw CMU Dinner at the Courier Cafe was excellent Everyone that I was with said that their meal was fantastic The atmosphere of the restaurant is very rustic The only complaint is that they are not prepared for groups larger than four We had six so we were seated a bit awkwardly at two adjoining tables one square the other circular The food and the atmosphere however are enough to give this establishment a 4 
qpI19Ri2Wlxhj2uxtyIxMg CMU Delicious It s tucked away and amazing They always give you more than enough to eat The atmosphere is so quaint I love the Misprint for desert My favorite sandwich is definitely the Club 
qq6WYcMNyCHAB7pWVbBL3w CMU Excellent food at lunch good prices quick service nice atmosphere I ll be going back often 
qseVJ0zYT9IR8sWkvfJWJg CMU Ok The cheese curds are awesome That s the one good thing My husband and I are not snooty people and I can t remember a time before this that we complained about service but it was really bad We went at about 7 on a saturday and it was empty The hostess stuck us in a back room even though the main room was empty We moved ourselves to a booth in the main room and politely let a waiter know From that point on it was downhill A group of waiters and bartenders huddled around the bar and ignored us for about 15 minutes before someone took our drink order The whole experience really brought me back to 4th grade I got the distinct impression that the staff did not think we were cool enough to be there And trust me we re way cool But the cheese curds were truly excellent 
qt4pHIBsWuKOFCjo8JWuOQ CMU Ate here for the first time tonight Had the 1 2 lb burger with all the fixings It was awesome I m not a burger person but was craving one tonight Glad I decided to try the Courier The burger was huge made just the way I wanted with all the trimmings Blue cheese onion lettuce tomato and Jalapeno I can t wait to go back Prices are sooooo reasonable Cost me and my girlfriend 25 for dinner that is including an appetizer The quality of food is great It s no wonder this business is owned by the same folks that have silvercreek Keep up the awesome work 
QWire1m4qsvEbsC4IwM8vA CMU If you look at my reviews you ll see that I hold a special place in my heart for dive bars And actually Bunny s is really nice and clean for a dive bar They have specials for food every day While it s standard bar food there are the delicious Bosco sticks warm breadsticks filled with hot melty cheese The beer is cheap Most of the fun for me is people watching There are lots of locals and they are all hilarious My favorite experience was learning video poker from three kindly gentlemen Plus it s close to Black Dog Perfect place to go after you re stuffed with barbecue 
qwmuwebwb8L79Nr9uG1k-A CMU I ve been wanting to go here since I moved to Illinois since I have heard a lot of good things about it Finally my co workers decided to make this the weekly spot to go out to eat so I was more than happy to tag along We went around 12 noon on a weekday The inside is pretty cozy and nicely decorated It s almost imperial looking with the large hanging drapes as curtains We had a large group of 10 and fortunately we were able to get a table The place itself seems very large as there were from what I could tell 3 distinct areas to sit in and an outside dining area as well All and all though the place came across as very average to me once everything was said and done Granted the restaurant was pretty busy it took our server literally 15 minutes to come get our order and another 15 to just get our drinks and most of us just had water The food did not take too long to come out but once again I wasn t impressed at all I got the club sandwich with waffle fries and I can t say it was bad at all but there was just not a thing special about it It s your typical greasy fare typee of place too Fries oozing grease bread and buns slathered with butter etc I also tried some of the cheese curds sounds disgusting but quickly found out it s just like a round mozerella stick waffle fries sweet potato fries and a classic slider which apparently is what they are known for sliders that is All of it was just very average and even the acclaimed slider was nothing special I would probably not go here again if I had the choice but other than I long wait to get waited on and an even longer one to get some drinks there is really nothing too major I can dock the restaurant for other than it just did not appeal to me much personally I should note our server was very friendly but I just can t really get into the food Just a very average joint 
qwvscDcx5xjrrGr68ZPn-A CMU Low key place that s good for drinks or a meal Half the place is taken up with pool tables and there is a pretty expansive arcade room with at least 10 different games as well as TV s everywhere 1 3 of the building has the bar and restaurant seating the seating is a 50 foot row of huge booths good for 8 10 people across from the equally long bar Both the booths and bar are deep mahogany the ceiling is black and there are only very dim lights over each booth so it s a rather dark relaxing atmosphere Bartender and servers are late 20s age and very charming None of that rushed overzealous high school service My partner and I have gone twice at odd times 1 45 and 3 30pm so I think we saw the lunch menu both times which was basic bar food with a couple extra options Burgers chicken and fried fish sandwiches salads and some appetizers all ranging 6 8 However they do have excellent Chicago style hotdogs which is actually a weekly lunch special Also have a white pizza with olive oil mozzarella fresh garlic and fresh roma tomatoes that s pretty decent a soft flavor that accentuates the tomatoes more than anything personally I love a strong garlic taste but this was OK It s even better with grilled chicken which by the way is not some 1 4 inch thick pinky long piece of meat My grilled chicken sandwich was a good couple inches wide and had no trouble covering their generous sized buns That goes for all dishes actually Huge portions The turkey club is a 4 inch stack of turkey bacon and toast with 4 handfuls of fries carrot cake is a 4 layer 1 5 of the cake slab of moist cake layered with cream cheese icing and perfectly roasted pecans carrots and coconut good for 4 people The white chicken chili is another extra offering that is not spicy but chocked full of beans chicken and tomatoes served with sour cream and shredded cheese The beans were almost crunchy which signaled they were not cooked long enough but the soup was still unique and served as a good meal starter Basically relaxed and charming atmosphere with lots of entertainment options for college students or perfect ambiance for quiet conversation and an American meal Tons of food for the money The parking lot is riddled with deep pot holes though and the place itself is tricky to enter from Neil St the first time you try to find it 
r-WQqctpYu-6KzfGSYx31A CMU One of my absolute favorites in CU Courier Cafe is the best place to relax and get some delicious American food Old fashioned soda fountain favorites like phosphates and malt shakes make this place unique but nearly everything is good Sandwiches are on fresh bread and burgers are thick and hearty There are a lot of vegetarian options my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge For the quality of food you get this place is actually a bargain I d prefer it over most of CU s fine dining establishments any day Service can be slightly slow but overall this is one of my favorite places to enjoy after a difficult test or a arduous paper writing spree 
R0QOGhyHHAlXpLhUbnGiWw CMU Came here for a late lunch and was pretty disappointed by the service Our waiter took our order promptly enough and we received our food The sandwich I ordered was on the wrong bread and I spent what seemed like forever waiting for the waiter to come back around In the meantime I discovered that there was also a hair in the sandwich I eventually managed to flag him down and asked about the bread He took it back to the kitchen and when he came back told me that they were out of the bread I ordered Ok so why didn t someone come out and ask me what I wanted instead rather than just making it with something else and hoping I wouldn t notice Seems pretty straightforward I got a new sandwich and by that time my boyfriend was almost done eating After that our waiter never bothered even stopping by our table again to check in other than walking by to drop off the check Sandwich was good the second one sans hair although the special sauce appeared to just be a mustard maybe they were out of that too 
raS9AINY6cztgbjWASUAQQ CMU Loved this place Flavored coffee almond French toast and biscuits and gravy are all winners 
RcQIrvPeHtXEj5Nmr7d3xw CMU Usually will get drug here with co workers every now and then Very average just passable food Typical greasy food type of fair A bit on the higher side price wise I think 10 for a sandwich and fries I hear at night the service crowds can get pretty bad but I ve always went for lunch and generally the service wait times were OK Yes not good just OK I would never go here if I had the choice but if I was with a group and ended up here for food I could probably find something to hold me over to my next meal without being too upset about it All and all this place is average at best 
rEqp6FUi6R3MeKuOpHXe5Q CMU We prolly should have come in a lot earlier First available table was right by the door It was pretty cold the whole time we ate Food was great but since it was so busy our wait service wasn t that great I d definitely still come here again but this time was so so 
RHCX-abiTPTU_pC7wZ5vuQ CMU I wasn t expecting much from Seven Saints yet somehow I still left disappointed There doesn t appear to be a beer menu perhaps because they re really proud of their Jameson and Red Bull cocktails ick and would rather advertise those on your table This would be okay if they hadn t hidden the drafts behind columns such that it s impossible to discover what types of beer they have The food menu was more promising It s split into two parts half the items were ripped off from Crane Alley beet chips with goat cheese sweet potato fries cajun crab cake and the other half are sliders Upscale White Castle Frankly the food wasn t particularly bad My friend enjoyed his salad But it wasn t particularly good either his slider was only so so and my sandwich was like a salt lick But I probably would have gone back just to break up the monotony of eating downtown if the service hadn t sucked When our waitress finally got around to us I ordered a sandwich She came back five minutes later to tell me that there had been a permanent substitution with that item By substitution she meant that it was nothing at all like the description perhaps it still had the same kind of bread When I told her I didn t want this new sandwich she made a big deal out of me being too picky and telling me that the kitchen was now going to be mad at her Permanent substitution Seriously print new menus and lose the attitude 
RHf3ElKWrtW_D5F1zeIAJg CMU The Courier Cafe has long been a great place to get delicious and well prepared food in Urbana The decor has literally not changed in decades and suits it well For this visit the wife and I ate small She had a quesadilla with sweet potato fries chips actually and I had the potato skins along with a ham and cheese Funny thing about their sandwiches The inside is warm but the bread is soft not toasted That was strange The potato skins have changed and I think this must depend on who is cooking I didn t like these as much as the old ones The old version was literally potato boats The new version are more like fries I was told the quesadilla was only fair not great I ordered the phosphate as always and it was a little bland Maybe they need to up the quality of their food again I wouldn t rush to go back as I always have 
rHHcJAwqmkcOupabUmAvTA CMU This place was recommended to me and I enjoyed myself When we first walked in I wasn t sure if I was underdressed was it a dinner only place the dark lighting the fancy decorations I couldn t tell But the maitre d was totally welcoming and when I asked Are you food only or can we get drinks he laughed and said it was no problem and asked where we wanted to sit We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice and got us our drinks fast After we sat down we realized we should have sat outside because of the beautiful weather but didn t feel like moving I didn t look at the food menu but a few people I was with ordered food Unfortunately 2 of the 3 orders were wrong One friend doesn t red meat and ordered chicken in her salad only to bite into a piece of steak Another friend said her food was just okay They had some nice beer choices and after several years in CA the prices seemed reasonable And actually I ordered a beer on tap that I didn t end up liking The bartender saw that I wasn t drinking it and asked if I wanted something else No problems no extra charges it was very considerate Granted I should have asked for a taste before I bought it but I would have eventually drank it It was just an extra bonus that I was able to get something else that I really enjoyed Overall a pleasant experience and I would recommend it 
riIhpCYWcBW39E14AROcag CMU I like Crane Alley I think I would go there more if I lived in Urbana living in deep west champaign I never really feel like it has anything to offer me that I need to drive to Urbana for I like their food alot especially balsamic spinach strawberry goat cheese salad AH and think the vibe is pretty nice clean waitresses cleavage unexposed no patrons likely to puke most of the time I ve had REALLY slow service there alot of times especially up in the loft 
rJ-jFVDR-G6pSsyjBaTApw CMU I love this place s decor sometimes I just go for the atmosphere I used to get the burgers here they re ok better than any others I can find in Urbana I think the star of the show is the milkshakes though Pretty cheap considering how much better it is than Green St options so if you have a car I would check it out 
RMod2_naSK9ggp6zjrAz0g CMU I went for the dollar beer again and met a friend for dinner I had the grilled chicken buffalo wrap The flavor was good but I think they use canned chicken for the grilled chicken and the bacon was rubbery but other than that it was not too bad The homemade potato chips that they served with the wrap were excellent 
RS2gmCsDbFm_QDP26O4how CMU With no visible signs or advertising you could easily overlook this place during your entire stint at the university By the way you can find it on the second floor northwestern corner of the Union I would recommend this place for guests of the Union Hotel who want to stick close to their rooms or anyone else who wants a slightly classier lunch option compared to the mall style food court in the Union s basement My department often takes visiting professors and job candidates here for lunch mostly because it is no fuss yet still feels professional Although there are no actual restrictions against the public dining here the location and atmosphere make it a more appropriate lunch option for the university community and campus visitors Food is served buffet style with daily soups salad bar sandwich bar hot bar and desserts In terms of quality I m pretty sure that the Ballroom uses the same food service company as the campus dining halls There s a good selection of crunchy veggies on the salad bar meats and cheeses for sandwiches and other items but I can t help but feel that I m reliving a slightly upscale version of my dorm years The hot bar is surprisingly good and probably the only part of the menu that sees significant rotation I ve never seen the same thing on the hot bar twice in a month This can be great if you plan to eat here regularly and don t like repetition it sucks once you ve found something you really like and know there s a slim chance of seeing it again Some of the past items I ve really enjoyed include chicken piccata eggplant parmesan and potato crusted fried fish There is usually a vegetarian entree and sides and the staff are good at answering questions if you have dietary restrictions Time has passed since Yelpers wrote about this place and the price has rose to around 10 per person This price includes access to the full buffet plus beverages and I think it is comparable to what you d probably pay at other buffet places 
rvMTFfj4XYyU8LkorAS0jQ CMU U of I is our favorite University we love the football our whole family has gone there and when we want beer and pizza Champaign Urbana is the place to be The floors are sticky and the bathrooms gross but Campus abounds in places with Orange and Blue ambiance But when we want a good breakfast before the game a really good burger after the game or an ice cream rush before the drive home this Illini family heads to Courier Cafe with nostalgic 70 s decor and honest food For breakfast I prefer the Courier for lunch any burger plus the sweet potato fries and for ice cream definitely the Misprint Sundae If you want fancier head down the street to its sister establishment Silver Creek For an off campus comfort food experience go to Courier Tell em the Chief sent you 
RVQaugeDFWa-kOD9BLFG-A CMU My friend and I being the old grammas we are decided to have dinner at 4 50 pm because we had been studying for a while and had super munchies I think one of the most appealing aspects of this restaurant is its warm inviting feel it brings to mind a quaint country hotel I like the dim lights I like the booth ed seats and I like the salad bar set up The normal tables with pull out seats however were awkwardly arranged the tables are kind of haphazardly mushed closed together Even the waitresses had trouble getting around the seats I was asked about 3 times to move so the waitress could squeeze her way behind my seat to get to a big table of 5 I ended up ordering the Banker s Burger about 5 00 1 3 patty swiss mushroom tomato on a toasty bun and sweet potato fries for additional dollar Thank goodness the burger was delicious because despite my friend and I getting there so early it took almost a half hour for our food to come The patty was done just perfectly and sat happily in my tummy The sweet potato fries I wasn t too fond of though they were more chips than fries Some of them were rather brown and burnt the more orange coloured ones were really good the crispier burnt ones left a very strong taste of charcoal in my mouth But overall I would come again The servers were slow but very friendly And really the price I paid for a whole VERY filling meal about 7 50 was extraordinarily within my budget 
RWHKABimo0m13rbuKF98Ew CMU I eat lunch at Bunny s at least once a week Bunny s has the best burgers in Champaign County without a doubt The one I get is called the Broadway Burger double meat and all I have to say is Swiss Cheddar or American It comes with a bag of chips so if you want fries you have to order them but this burger doesn t need fries Load up the burger at the condiment rack with lettuce tomato onions pickles whatever and you have the best burger around I know I ve eaten a burger at just about every place in all of Champaign County and this is the best 
RwUiu5FekROF5aVCR-97rg CMU I really like the outdoor seating they have and the place is pretty big w out having too much of a line Good place if you re not a fan of typical campus bars More townies and older people Really bad name though 
RyM4NvHGDrJiiqWsijk4Hw CMU I was really not that impressed with the food I had a burger and it was ok I ordered the sweet potatoe fries thinking they were fries but they are actually chips I don t think I would go there again for the food 
ry_afbFzfkllQYXsfjnO6A CMU I love this place I have been here for only three times during the past two years of my stay at Urbana but all being in just past two months and I totally repent for not exploring this place earlier I now even have a buddy who loves this place as much as I do and I am sure we are gonna visit more often here This time we ordered veggie burgers the garden salad and the black bean each and a side order of Veggie dippers The veggie dippers were amazing I really like the sweet potato fries here and when combined with other veggies it truely adds to the taste I heard their milk shakes are awesome something to look forward to for the next visit 
s1kYeij7I6v1kFRbzbjnNQ CMU I have to agree that the milkshakes are wonderful I love a mocha one The 8 after 8 is a great deal But I have been with a group of people and met with an unfriendly reception when we wanted to eat at the Courier The manager I assume acted as though he couldn t care less if he got our business or not So we went to a place nearby and enjoyed ourselves The wait staff is friendly however 
sCFGOweFEr9I28xaNEzj6w CMU Same deal as when I went to another one of their campus locations food was served really fast fresh and wonderfully tasty 
seRVdWo2lraZNuWp81LClA CMU The building has a long history and lots of character It s plenty crowded at Saturday breakfast a good sign that the locals like it I enjoyed my whole wheat french toast and thought the coffee was good There s a metered parking lot just across the street east free nights and weekends 
SKhxdlLKFt5-Y7R0Df36_g CMU Five stars for the ice cream Hands down No questions asked Do not even think about Steak and Shake You must come here for their homemade ice cream that they use for delicious shakes and the highly recommended sundaes see picture As for the regular food 3 stars in quality 2 stars for how I wish fries came with my meal I had the turkey croissant which was good but gave me a vibe of how I could have made it at home I do not like how fries are not automatically included with sandwiches see picture However my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his Southern Fried Chicken The Skinny Dippers were to die for literally there s sour cream bacon and cheese on them The ambiance is great and classic They have an ample number of wooden booths and a beautiful copper ceiling The menu looks like it came from a printing press used to advertise the 1893 World s Columbian Exposition for which I believe they have pictures of on the walls I would recommend Courier Caf as great place to top off a dinner date meal take your family or catch up with friends During nice weather they have outdoor seating 
sloeQmNr_f8lUIJiFRfFMQ CMU Hmmm firehaus was nice on the inside air conditioned clean for a bar espec a campus bar My dining partner and I thought the firefighter photography on the wall was on the depressing side but at least it fit the motif Our waitress was competant and left us alone to conduct our business My sandwhich was 7 though and I still had to pay extra for fries Not crazy about that 
sSv_YIztXzkSsp4au8lRyQ CMU This place is an old standby esp with alums and old timers Once upon a time say around 20 years ago there really weren t many places in town to eat that weren t fast food and weren t high end Courier bridged this gap in a nice space In the meantime MANY fine restaurants at all price points of come along and the Courier has more or less stayed the same That is to say good but not great food spotty service sometimes depending on the crowds and often long waits 
sxUITeF2OZssssHXn4vALg CMU Worst food ever I went with friends and no one managed to order anything good The chicken salad tasted like mayo coated cardboard the build your own tacos were unique and the pickles were disgusting limp hamburger chips How do you screw up pickles when you re called Pickles The star is for the decor if you re ever just desperately nostalgic for both your great aunt s living room and late 80 s early 90 s kitsch this is the place Hopefully it ll get better as it makes the transition to Greek food 
sz-2wwnkh6mw6nUQl0IIwg CMU im sad to see that this place has been getting such bad reviews this was my favorite place to eat when i lived in champaign i have not been there in at least 6 months so i am rating it on my past experiences i have had so many awesome dinners here and i like the beer selection im gonna return next time im in town to see if its really as bad as these reviews say 
TLusaz9S69MHyyl0W3qoXw CMU We always seem to have the Jack Daniels ribs they are so good they melt in your mouth We have had other items on the menu but the ribs are to die for 
tNWY4GYxJhnPRZT0_x_aUA CMU I absolutely love Seven Saints Andy is fantastic and always around to give advice on drinks and ensure the experience is as great as possible The waitstaff is EXTREMELY knowledgable on different liquors and beer They are particularly helpful on whiskey and beer but more than adequate on just about anything else as well The only negative thing I can say is they have changed my thoughts on what to expect out of waitstaff and I have found many other bars restaurants lacking The drink list is huge and new things are constantly being added Its very common for there to be a few off the list specials particularly on Wednesday nights Wednesdays are a great night to go since 1 4 of the whiskey is half off that night in rotation I have tasted a ton of different whiskeys I never would have tried if it wasn t for this night The waitstaff is always glad to recommend something new based off your criteria and I have ended up purchasing several bottles from my home bar after trying them at Seven Saints The food is good and always comes out quick I am particularly fond of the cheese curds waffle fries and sweet potato fries Most sandwiches are sliders so don t expect a large sandwich They have a deal where you can split soup salad and a slider for a good price that s normally what I choose Their caesar salad is great 
ToJW855_Av8fT22mBEQDUg CMU Wait staff was decent but I was hoping that the establishment would be responsive to the community post students No such luck They coudn t put anything but sports on the tiniest t v Have a nice summer Firehaus We ll spend our money elsewhere 
tqMpw7TG_1YOzp8IGCbGjA CMU I dragged my asian wife here saying she had to try it and she said Why Why and when she saw the menu she was horrified because the food is essentially country cooking burgers sandwiches However it s the healthiest and freshest and best tasting venue of its type in the history of CU and they continue the tradition of Bubby Zadies by offering a salad bar with amazing offerings She was amazed and wanted to come back Then I dragged my 81 year old mom to the place and she was aching and complaining about the steps and getting there but she left with a HUGE grin on her face and she had a wonderful time Best shakes in CU bar none Best ice cream deserts in CU bar none One of the top 3 venues in CU the old Courier newspaper offices with plaster decorated ceilings tallback wooden booths and a 1910 feel to it Very friendly waittresses The only place I can think of that competes with it in terms of a Venue is a cafe near the old train station but I think that closed 2 decades ago This is a popular late night place to go after Contra Dancing in Crystal Lake Park or even dancing at the Regent ballroom The food is priced very reasonably and this is one of the few places in CU that is a candidate as a great hangout a place where you can come all the time and get to know the staff DO NOT MISS VISITING THE COURIER CAFE 
Tqr59rdL2Gk3CUzH0bjX4g CMU I went here for my birthday dinner upon recommendation from a friend I agree with a previous reviewer the ambiance of this place has a restaurant chain feel The crowd was what looked like a mix of graduate students and older couples Seven Saints is known for their sliders these mini burgers kinda like what White Castle serves The sliders are about 3 to 4 bucks each so it s perfect for ordering a slew of them I ordered fried cheese curds for appetizers which were delicious though a little soggy then again anything fried pretty much tastes good There are plenty of vegetarian options Any slider can be replaced with a boca burger 50 cents extra but in my opinion a boca burger patty overwhelms any other taste So what you end up with is pretty same tasting burgers my boca blackjack cheese slider tasted like my Asian one The waffle fries were especially good though better than The Office s ones in Urbana IMO The beer selection is limited so this place is decent to take group for dinner there are better bar options for drinks elsewhere The service was adequate and attentive but not overly so What s with the Third Eye Blind love There were like 3 TEB songs that played that night S There s also some outdoor seating I could definitely image coming back here for lunch I also like the fact that Seven Saints is directly across from the bus train station who needs to spend 10 bucks on a cab when there s convenient public transportation nearby My friends rode their bikes here and took a bus back home they have racks on the front of the bus to load bikes All in all Seven Saints is a decent option for lunch and dinner but you can find better spirits elsewhere i e Blind Pig others 
tSLeGJkDN_MTUdnzKumDVA CMU Large selection of good beers Unfortunately everything else is bad Insipid sugary cocktails and overpriced food I ve rarely had anything good here The beet chips are pretty good but the wings seem to be soaked in battery acid and the tempura is just gross who fries moist baby carrots I had some good steak once but that was quite unusual Come for pool and drinks leave when you get hungry 
TTnqIlHvipBhs9OOOx-cRQ CMU I think that Seven Saints is wonderful I have been there now a few times and everything is delicious I also find it to be reasonably priced 
TYI00g86-5kMZeCSu0xkBA CMU Not bad Rock s is a decent bar pub grill patio spot that is pleasant in the summer heat The beers are nice and cold with a decent selection and it s hard to find fault in that place It doesn t strike me as exceptionally standout but it s a solid dining location 
U74e_zeFpWosHCMPJkHJHA CMU I would give this place a 3 5 stars Their pastrami sandwich was good and the bread was very fresh but price was a little steep compared to their burgers Their hand dipped shake was awesome so much better than Steak Shake They even gave us the extras in another cup Great service too 
U9hmJyuSvcj-pCBKt1HSvw CMU I ve been a little stingy with my 5 stars these days and I m tempted to rate this 4 but the sweet potato fries there is just nothing like them I ve been here twice now during my quarterly visits to C U The food burgers in both instances has been consistently good Now I live really really close to the infamous Kuma s Corner in Chicago their burgers are so famous they ve been featured on the Food Network That having been said my standards are pretty high and Crane s I must say makes a darn tasty burger Today I had the special 1 2 burger with mole roasted chilies pork shoulder and chihuahua cheese oooohhhh yes Aside from tasty burgers their beer selection rocks They literally have one full page of IPAs And that s just the tip of the iceberg Their draft beers which I believe rotate are quality as well The place is big their outdoor alley seating is great in the summer and the service is good Though I must warn you my first time in the summer was during some crayfish special tables of rowdy bikers cheered on ladies in leather bumping and grinding in their laps I m not sure what was going on and I don t know if it is somehow related to the crayfish just thought it was worth mentioning 
ucNIO-rrTni4eCzy914kWQ CMU My husband and I ate here today for the first time The ambience and atmosphere is GREAT Beer selection ditto Food was pretty good but I had the salmon slider and as some others have noted it was too salty I also ordered it with lettuce and tomato the waiter specifically asked me if I wanted any extras but then it arrived with only the toppings listed in the menu 7 Saints Salad was good my husband s burger slider and Caeser Salad were good We enjoyed the hummus appetizer So overall a positive experience but not perfect
