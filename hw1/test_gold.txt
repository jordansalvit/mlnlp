2DbecSJbF1Wu5A1Ukn_r-Q CMU These are the best casual food burgers I ve had but I had fast food written there first which would definitely be wrong I get a little annoyed at them taking 15 minutes to make a burger in a place that has a less charming interior than McDonalds The long wait time is the only thing that stops me from going here more than twice a year or so It s hard to find a clean table here as well Fries are very good but annoyingly large portions 
2DFvc5Z6W3rcJXQPYoJrEQ CMU Authentic food cozy environment recommendations are 61 73 service is little bit slow you usually wait for 20mins to get your dishes 
2g84hN-IL5Mni8X8Gi3epQ CMU Consistently tasty The waffles here are unlike any waffles I ve had before I have visited this place upwards of ten times in the past year and I enjoy the consistently tasty selection The ice cream is amazing and it s nice to have a fresh fruit option I highly recommend this place as a morning date though it may also be good as a late night snack Try the speculoos 
2G9JmzXj4jxArN_pJEuyng CMU This is the only restaurant in central Oakland that is both tasty and reasonably healthy Plus they make a big deal of using sustainably locally grown foods whenever possible I have to disagree with one of the reviewers disdain for the soup the spicy gumbo is pretty good though I always end up having to add extra hot sauce My personal favorite things about Red Oak include 1 Newly expanded hours 7 AM 9 PM so I can usually get food when I m hungry 2 Blue plate special is a really good deal My favorite one is jambalaya but the pulled pork and the fish are also good 3 Vegetarian blue plate option beans veg grain usually not terribly exciting but definitely healthy and tasty in an unassertive way 4 You can get vegetables as a side dish instead of chips 5 Oatmeal smoothie should be absolutely disgusting by any standard of reckoning but it is actually really delicious and can be a meal substitute in a pinch if you re running really late and have to drink your breakfast out of a straw while you run to class 6 All the sandwiches and salads are really tasty and you can get a salad made into a wrap if you want The things that kind of annoy me about Red Oak 1 It gets really crowded over lunchtime and if the short middle aged woman who works there thinks you ve taken long enough to eat your meal she will tell you so Best times to go are before or after the big lunchtime rush 2 It s a bit more expensive than the other lunch restaurants in that part of town but totally worth it especially when you consider that the food is fresh and good for you unlike the other restaurants in Oakland 
2gFDzKuTgQy-6V5XzJOExw CMU Pretty good little indian spot Cool dining room old house turned into restaurant Service was not bad a little difficult to understand at times tho Food was generally good I ve only had indian a few times so it s hard for me to compare but here s what I could gather I had the chicken vindaloo the sauce was very good very spicy I like spicy but the chicken was dry and the potatoes tasted odd they were either pre made frozen or deepfried and then became soggy I m not sure My gf has the tikka masala which was about on the same level Dry chicken undercooked peppers good sauce tho The Channa Batura on the other hand was exceptionally good Comes with a chickpea curry which tasted damn near perfect Came same time as the rest of the food for some reason but could not recommend this dish more There s a good chance we ll return for more 
2GgfkmDhvVxvglvCZs1A9A CMU You would not think this was going to be a good time Toast is strategically located between the Hillman Cancer Center and Cricket s strip club overlooking the bus highway Parking is on the street The building itself is nondescript Walk in Inside it is warm dark and VERY COZY The crowd is laid back and friendly The menu is sophisticated yet not fussy The restaurant has confidence We went there once with reservations and the manager immediately said I have a seat upstairs but no one is up there I m guessing you want to be downstairs Let me buy you a glass of wine and we ll get you seated when the next table comes up here That s the kind of smart service you want Loved it Overall Very sexy Bring your spouse Bring a date Bring both They ll thank you for it 
2gGKP0YOg4yrldW_owkaZg CMU Dude get the morning after breakfast my friend says What is it he says Don t worry trust me Most of the time this scenerio has a bad ending but this time I am glad I took my stoner friend s advice The morning after breakfast is their banana chocolate chip pancakes with bacon egg and sausage It was so so so so good If you re coming to visit Pittsburgh you have to go to Pamelas My only gripe about it is that for a breakfast place they open late 7 30am 
2gwZQqDgVa77r44brevQxA CMU I was told that we absolutely had to check this place out as it s apparently a famous local chain dating back to the coal mining days We went there for lunch at a fairly busy time so waiting for service took a little while I was a little confused as to whether we were supposed to order up or just seat ourselves but it was apparently the latter Do make sure you catch someone s eye when you re going there for lunch as they have an upstairs and a downstairs to serve and as far as i can tell barely a handful of people at work It s probably a good thing we went there hungry Each item on the menu is already more than filling including the so called sides They definitely deliver on their promise that every sandwich ordered is piled high with fries cole slaw and tomatoes unless you ask otherwise The meat might be a little hard to find beneath all these but not to worry it s there and you can still taste it Their streetman fries are a heart attack in a basket fries with chili cheese bacon and sour cream Don t order it as a side unless there s quite a few in your party It really is a meal to itself and more It s definitely worth at least one visit 
2hqpc3ztTxMR-pgrHOC4uA CMU I had heard a lot about Toast from a friend and was excited to try it Unfortunately I was underwhelmed I ordered fish over a bed of rice and the rice was very dry not Basmati try but dry to the point of being hard and undercooked The rest of my food was average but I think there are better restaurants in Pittsburgh at this price range Where Toast shines is as a wine bar The wine list is excellent and the atmosphere is intimate Parties are seated close together and if I were to give Toast another try it would likely be on a date 
2IpBhwrV-lXCebTlLKd-VQ CMU The food is good but the service and atmosphere is terrible I have been to this place a few times and it s always slow and there s not usually a table available to sit down at They sell a variety of six packs and 40s to go but beware Boone s Farm is quite literally the top shelf The staff is very rude on my last visit they messed up my order and gave me general tso s chicken instead of tofu The counter lady was pretty mean to me when I asked for it to be remade She then proceeded to give what should have been my meal to another guy who DID order chicken after me but who didn t want to take it because I had ordered extra spicy and he didn t want spicy food The cashier laughed at him argued with him that even medium would be too hot for him and in the end got him take my messed up order reluctantly She then proceeded to help five more people before she had the chef make the tofu that I ordered Like I said the food is good but I wouldn t go back to this place There are too many other Asian restaurants in Oakland where they don t make it difficult to get what you ordered 
2j68598aW38AsusySWzbEQ CMU Orgasm for the mouth soft and sweet but not too sweet I had the nutella banana waffle and adored it My friend had the strawberres and cream and liked hers as well My waffle was not cooked all the way in the middle and I didn even blink an eye I just kept swooping that delicious forkful of belgian inspired wonder right onto my tongue Coffee is priced fairly cheap just drip coffee buts ok in a pinch for coffee I love lattes and cappucinos so I would love if they had this option on their menu but that would make it more of a patisserie than a waffle shop All in all fun little stop great snack to warm you up from your shopping trips down murray ave I don t know how it compares to Oh yeah s over in shadyside but after comparing yelp reviews I chose it over the 3rd waffle shop which is close to Oh yeahs name escapes me The only gripe I have with some of the shadyside eats and treats places including Oh yeah s are the hours catering to nightlifers That may be good for business but you re missing business from us thirty somethings who graduated kindergarten and love to enjoy brunch at brunch time sunday morning to afternoon 
2JF5iM4BmXQ_t0P9pwFVkQ CMU I ve only visited the Murrysville location and there is no way it even comes close to In N Out Burger The food is extremely greasy so much so that it drips off the burger as you eat it The fries are greasy too and not at all crispy The free toppings were gross bacon full of fat soggy mushrooms must be all the grease Worst of all the prices are not reasonable I m not sure why other reviewers are even comparing the two In N Out is more fast food Five Guys seems more restaurant style no drive through etc Anyway there must be a better option for burgers and fries 
2JQ1cDosm6m9AOoemg-9Sw CMU I came here on a Friday night around 9 pm with my boyfriend and my parents who were staying at a nearby B and B We wanted to go somewhere both casual and inexpensive and La Feria definitely is both of those things We almost didn t find it it s upstairs above Pamela s Pamela s was closed of course but all the lights were on and we eventually figured out to ascend the staircase and seek out La Feria There was only one other table of diners so it was very quiet in the eating area There are about 15 tables and there are boldly colored Peruvian crafts everywhere you look We all decided to order lemonade and limeade which was a great choice The drinks were refreshing and fresh not too sour or too sweet I ordered one of the daily specials which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce It came with white rice a green salad with two kinds of cheese two tomatoes slices an olive red onion walnuts and light dressing and two slices of French bread The chicken itself was great the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice I really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and I looooove cheese The bread was pretty standard so I used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce Nom My boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich which I tasted Not as much meat as I d like but it was very juicy and flavorful Also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting For dessert we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them Everyone really enjoyed their meal It just feels like a good place to spend your money It s small it s cheap it s interesting food and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable I think we d be happy to go back if we were ever in the neighborhood I really want to taste those empanadas 
2js1f4it7yZAZeGY2nhU9w CMU Typical americanized Asian food that serves three stars As a broke college student within walking distance of Lulu s I continue to go there due to convenience and the sheer fact that it is exponentially better than college campus food The problem I have with Lulu s is not the food itself it is to be expected with the prices but it is with the service There is a definite inconsistency with the service and at times my friends and I are left waiting for someone to take our order for 20 minutes despite letting the hostess know how long we have been waiting Or chasing down a waitress for more water I don t know if they treat us like this because we are college students but I feel that service is one of their biggest weakness So come here if you want large portions for a fair price and don t expect too good of service But as long as I go to Carnegie Mellon and I am broke I will still go here 
2k3MofKieNIv5I5rXSxcOA CMU Nice atmosphere confusing concept A coworker and I had lunch at the porch a few weeks ago At lunch you place your order and are given an order number and can sit anywhere you like much like Hello Bistro which is run by the same organization We decided to eat outside since it was a nice day someone brought our iced teas and our meals quickly followed The pizza I ordered was good but we weren t sure how to get our iced teas refilled which didn t last very long on a 90 degree day There wasn t anyone going around so I eventually went inside and refilled our glasses with water from the self serve containers Great location ok food but a bit overpriced for self serve 
2KBC-pxd_KP6ZJ2J1wQv_Q CMU not really japanese food the menu of food is actually a big mix of random chinese and japanese food put together the sushi it self is poor the fish quality was really bad i sat at the bar to get a closer look and after the look i decided to get things that were safe to eat such as inari tofu pockets i always order safe and cooked things when i feel the fish might be a killer several hours later the cooked food is blah i ve had much better and i m pretty sure the grocery store frozen section is better miso was super super salty and grainy which im not a fan of overall i wont be coming back if i have a choice 
2KfdH5Vcu7nrba6UNhYghA CMU Thank you to Bonnie T who mentioned that Village Pizza had moved to 815 S Aiken Ave I will leave my review there BTW that move also came with a name change they are now S Aiken Bar and Grille I was so sad when I walked by the old Village Pizza and they were closed When I read that they had moved I walked to the address and was even more confused that it did not say Village Pizza 
2l-dX7tt_bswkb7R1q-1PQ CMU Best Thai food that I have ever had The good was amazing We had the dumplings crab ragoons and pad thai The food had great tast The waitress was very attentive The mood was relaxing There were candles and it looked over looked the street Sit by the window you won t regret it 
2LpjrcwpZ_6eSU337jeJ_g CMU Yum Rangoon night market noodles mango pork indonesian festival rice lemongrass beef all make me want to come to Pittsburgh more often Want to try new things on the menu but its hard to resist old favorities Can be hard to find parking or a table but its worth the trip 
2LQ9DtzeOUmX_udEJgGeLQ CMU I d prob give Soba 3 5 stars if I could We didn t want to drive in the snow so walked over to Soba on a Friday night and actually made reservations just an hour before we prob won t get away with that on a non stormy night After a blast of warm air I was welcomed into this dark cozy and seductive venue We were led up to the top level and settled in I ordered a Sapporo calamari and tuna Beer always hits the spot for me Calamari was delicious with a nice mayo sauce with a squirt of lime The tuna was tender My butter knife cut into it so easily The side of kimchi was just okay and the abundance of hot sauce sauce was to much for me Fried rice went well with everything and balanced the tuna and sauce out We then ordered the coconut cashew brownie which was delicious too as suggested by the waitress The portions were large imho and while the service was fantastic I just thought the food was priced a tad high for what was offered Seems like Soba would be nice for a special occasion or just to have a nice dinner though 
2Lx26zkmMtAiUU--h25Srw CMU I really feel bad about giving a one star review First it s not about the service price decor or the food I m writing this review after going there twice The first time my husband and I went the dinner was good We thought this place has the potential to be our go to Chinese restaurant in Pgh Today I remembered that they have an early bird special 3 6pm m sat The won ton soup was not authentic more like chicken noodle soup but wasn t bad The entree was fine What really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco cigarette smell from the tea I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum The smell wouldn t leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine 2 3 minutes then brush as long as I could to get rid of the smell Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray first visit 3 stars second visit 5 stars 2 stars 
2n042gTdNDDLLRXWSUftLg CMU This place is a gem The food wine and service exceeded our expectations It s a great place to take a date or just get away for an excellent meal The place is a bit small so if you intend on going be sure to make a reservation a few days in advance on open table The chef apparently did his training in the Richmond VA area so you ll be able to see the southern influence in the menu For me the food completely changed my perception on what southern food could be I had a smoked pork shoulder with pureed sweet potatoes the flavor was indescribable My wife and I will pay this place a visit again for sure 
2NiuRQp2uOo0zC_CYVpZCA CMU What a production I don t even know where to start The place is small They didn t lie to me when I made the reservation Of course we had to pick the busiest day and time Saturday at 7pm The nice lady on the phone told me a reservation helps but we may still have to wait I did appreciate that tip from her Sure enough we showed up and it s PACKED The unfortunate thing is it was cold so eating on their patio was not going to happen Therefor people cram into what tiny space is allowed in the front But when I say tiny I really mean no space at all An older man pretty much barked orders at us and demanded to know if we had a reservation Thank God we did I was a little scared of him when he ran off muttering about no seating in you ain t got reservations So the first table of the restaurant is thee worst because people are standing on top of you jealously staring down at you and your food Of course we ended up with that table Thankfully our server and anyone else helping out was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable We started with the mussels app It came in a light garlic sauce and was a good amount of mussels I d say they were pretty tasty and I loved dipping the bread into the sauce The bread actually became my best companion that night more on that later I ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and mozz cheese I LOVE when Italian restaurants dump the sauce on and this was a winner I LOVE SAUCE I know some people aren t into that so I ll warn you if you like light sauce you WON T be happy After having gnocchi at Il Pizzaiolo in South Hills earlier that week I know I m on an Italian kick it didn t hold a candle to those light little pillows of pasta and potato The sauce though delicious Much to my husbands chagrin I had a hard time keeping myself from grabbing his plate He had the spinach and ricotta ravioli which I didn t have have a bite of but the SAUCE oh my Orgasmic I love tomato cream sauce and this was amazing I kept dipping my bread into his sauce with him increasingly getting annoyed Did I want to risk a fight for that delicious sauce maybe It was soooo good But the real action took place as we were finishing up our meal I had noticed the older dude owner walking around with a glass of red wine the whole time I thought that he was pretty rude but kinda funny in a typical Italian way Well I start to sense a commotion beside me and realize the owner and a server are in a heated convo Then the older dude screams get outta here you F A hole and then shoves him Whoa I was shocked a boss would do that to an employee Come to find out it s his son A woman who I assume was also part of management maybe even a family member came over to our table and apologized joked this was normal Italian behavior and offered us free dessert I thought that was really nice of her and and appreciated I just feel bad because those kind of things take down a business The good was great but witnessing that you wonder how long you can work like that Hopefully the dude can retire to a nice Italian villa with lots of wine instead of screaming at his son in the middle of his restaurant 
2nwhw66COV0xdkOmia7_BA CMU I had a terrible experience at Toast after enjoying it several times The food I was served was inedible and I have NEVER before sent food back in a restaurant I was told that they were too busy to make me anything else So I ate salad and dessert for dinner They didn t apologize or try to do anything to make it right I have contacted them numerous times since then and despite being told that it was just a bad night they have not done anything to make it up to me or to make me willing to return So disappointing 
2OiB3PRkovFTTcQlvEYqDQ CMU Went to Big Jim cause Guy went there before and there is not too much individual diner on yelp close by Ok the let s go have a average expectation Guy s recommendation bottom line is edible and sometimes have surprise but not this time Atmosphere is good like an average diner but places is not clean carpet smells and table is sticky that s ok food should be good Me and my wife order the Steak Hoagie comes with salad and the Spaghetti and meat sauce with 2 meat ball extra Salad came first it is a mix wit shredded iceberg lettuce grape style tiny tomato some purple cabbage with home salad dressing Lettuce is DARK BAD and MUSSY since I was on vacation I worry I had stomach ache so I skip it The Steak Hoagie for five buck I give a 2 thumbs up bread is soft hot and toast on spot although the mayo on the sandwich is quite a bit the outcome balance the steak with fresh sliced tomato some shredded iceberg lettuce then question coming how come the salad iceberg lettuce are so sucks pls prepare as per order instead it is not a fast food joint Last and I never come back is the meat ball the Spaghetti and meat sauce I don t know how to describe how could it be like this I am pretty sure Guy s taste bud is excellent no doubt but this is too much and hit my bottom line for food spaghetti is ok not too soggy just a little more watery About the meat sauce is ok but taste like can sauce and fresh tomato and shredded meat mix together still ok edible I will give a pass BUT THE MEAT BALL OMG taste like 1 it is mussy pretty bland 2 it taste weird then I try to smells it OMG I threw all of them on the plate it smells like shit it either over cook or something wrong At the end of today I did went to washroom 2 times I am pretty sure I will not come back 
2oWYvenLVc-EJP_NWI8sJQ CMU Best Indian I have had so far in Pittsburgh Food is well spiced and the saag is probably the best I have ever had Naan left a little bit to be desired Service is a bit sloppy slow easily flustered but friendly nonetheless They got my order wrong and didn t offer to fix it probably because I was happy with what they sent out and had already eaten half of it All in all I will go back 
2p5CmCV541yjoSb24DtIRQ CMU Fusion is difficult to pull off well Have you ever noticed that Fusion almost always involves East Asian food and American cuisine Thai corn chowder Are they really going crazy for corn chowder in Chang Mai You never find say Mexican Moroccan or Ethiopian Brazilian fusion places That would be really inventive Instead with Soba you have another pan Asian American Fusion joint although I don t think I ve been to a better one The mussels are incredible a meal in themselves and a bargain at 9 I had the chopped salad with fresh mango avocado mint and just a hint of spice The best meal I ve had here was the mussels followed by the tuna The crabcakes are also good made with lump crabmeat If you feel like something vaguely Asian but not too Asian ex kimchee pancakes you won t find a better option But if you want something truly original you have to go elsewhere 
2pEFfCFN27LPNyLOXV9iTg CMU The pastrami sandwiches are sooooooooooooooo good AND it has fries on it It s huge and horrible for you but you ll love it 
2pUQd9pbBCm1bTZvcF9-Vg CMU CLOSED This place is gone 
2Q0rrAKuhQpOPkYLQc1SiA CMU Great Remodel Place looks fantastic Great Service Waitress was on her game and seemed to know the name of some of the people at the other tables Good food The Buffalo chicken salad was good and the honey buns are delicious My associate had eggs and bacon and said the eggs were perfect and you could tell they were fresh not out of a box Later our waitress confirmed that and went on to explain how they work with local farmers to make everything as fresh as possible The rolls from the bakery were fresh and good Enjoyed the coffee too For the price it can t be beat 
2qLS8_bNwnXdZAPBPr2WvA CMU Always a pleasure to eat in a Japanese owned sushi restaurant Ambience is bucolic weird description I know but the atmosphere was very calming Lots of thought goes into the presentation My friend ordered the blackened cod which was served on an expertly fashioned banana leaf 
2rIJ4m_JiLWtHZKhAJo1-w CMU Amazing food Really enjoyed the complexity of these dishes Very unique and the service was fantastic I ll definitely return here again 
2rq5ZDSRSWJ26cMb9PzlKg CMU Surprisingly good food for such an oddly uninviting storefront Pick up order was ready within 10 minutes of my phone call which involves silly levels of efficiency Squid salad wasn t so spicy but was really good Sliced ginger was a little strong but squid was actually tender Laos spearmint came with cubed chicken zucchini carrots broccoli standard veggies Not a very strongly flavored dish I didn t think I d ever use the word subtle for a takeout place but it s appropriate Avocado shake was like any other avocado shake except for a few ice chunks that hadn t been blended in all the way Really good for Pittsburgh extra points for being 2 blocks away and cheapish 
2S6J97DCyncmBdEj-XMNuw CMU The falafel was dry and not very crisp I got a falafel wrap and it was more salad iceberg lettuce and few tomatoes cucumbers than falafel I only counted 2 falafel balls Overall wasn t impressed and wouldn t go back unless desperate 
2sfdovJgU_cQCbfGOAeEBw CMU Wow this was good A group of 6 of us went last night showing up with our own case of beer We essentially ordered enough varied entrees for the table to create our own buffet I don t have a refined Indian food palate so I usually stick to the safe stuff BUT I will tell you the Chicken tika masala was one of the best that I ve ever had Plates were licked clean the sauce was so amazing The Vindaloo was also great we ordered it super spicy and it delivered Saag Paneer was better than most places as well very rich and delicious I really enjoyed that this was in an old house converted to a restaurant Many of the Indian places in pittsburgh don t pay much attention to ambiance or setting Tamarind gives it a little more attention apologies if I ve butchered the spelling of any Indian dishes 
2sMMj16R0mDYXZWn917KbA CMU Lulu s noodles is in an extremely convenient location for students coming from CMU so it should be no surprise that most weekdays around lunch time the place is packed The few times I have been there I have found the food to be okay nothing to write home about The Pho was utterly terrible and the various noodle dishes only passable The biggest problem though has been with the service You place your order at the counter and they are supposed to bring it to you Several times I ve found myself forgotten and having to go back to ask where my food is All in all it will do in a pinch if you re a CMU student otherwise steer clear 
2srFCtHwMrGmQvgvglUVxg CMU Apparently I will do anything for a well dressed salad Their salad is fantastic and so is the bread that comes with it However the first floor and bathrooms ALWAYS smell like sewage The last time I was there the ceiling was leaking and kept dripping on us and bc the restaurant was packed we had to demand to be moved to another table In fact this restaurant always feels straight up dirty The food is just alright but there are a few standout items like the omelette and the wedding soup 
2T9u3ZqVPAqNInNzoVCmbg CMU A decent deli for Pittsburgh but this place is no match for other deli s around the country It will never be a Brent s LA They have a huge menu with very reasonable prices The staff is very friendly I started off with a bowl of matzo ball soup This was one of the worst bowls that I have every have 2 lumps of matzo balls in chicken broth There was no carrots noodles chicken or flavor I ordered the corned beef and latkes for dinner The latkes were excellent served with applesauce and sour cream The Noodle Kugel side that I ordered was OK but not great definitely didn t taste homemade The corned beef was very average and looked and tasted closer to grocery store quality than deli quality I saw some of the sandwiches that others ordered reuben vs rachel coleslaw instead of sauerkraut They looked very good Are there no bakeries in Pittsburgh They get their deserts from New York German Chocolate cake Carrot Cheesecake Key Lime Pie Coconut Cake and Red Velvet cake 
2TpXJcqf7ngYTm0TBRGdmw CMU Service 2 5 stars out of 5 Food 2 5 stars Price 4 stars easily under 10 person Atmosphere 1 stars unless you like shouting and being cold A number of people have said that this a great place for college students to get decent cheap food I completely concur My low marks come from the fact that I don t want food that is just decent or cheap I want it to be tasty and I m willing to pay for that Also it felt like a college cafeteria the stereo was loudly playing poppy dance hip hop and rock songs So I m getting a whole bunch of pop lyrics layered with everyone around me shouting over the music I could barely hear my wife right across the table There seemed to be a cool breeze blowing across my legs from somewhere Perhaps it was from the 8 inch hole in the wall behind us The food was greasy yet satisfying The white rice was a bit chewier than I like it At least the tea was tasty and stayed nice and hot 
2uKYrNvSbB1rsxwDbkvrfw CMU I went with an out of town friend for lunch and wish I had taken her elsewhere Our waitress looked half asleep and was not knowledgeable about the menu I got a Pizza Margherita and the center was actually soggy How did they mess that up My friend said her sandwich was good but neither of us took the leftovers home with us Meh 
2uU0emx-VgBKcykDZlxVOg CMU This is like being in a movie about a diner minus the fake quality Awesome people watching I recommend the fried green tomatoes and the hot brown These might be okay in the light of day Other things not so much 
2UXxwmiWryDVohr_rRZRPg CMU Great healthy and fresh food I highly recommend for lunch but sometimes the wait can be a little long Garden veggie goat cheese chicken and salads are a good bet A little more expensive than some chain restaurants for lunch but worth it 
2vc__5mZ2auEaban26OHzg CMU Typical dinner place on the level of a good Applebees with great Margaritas 
2Y-GvAY3gKJJoDgAMSvsMg CMU We received good service and the food was good and consistent and the prices were reasonable Based on our experience with a few high end restaurants while in Pittsburgh this warrants 4 stars 
2YjlZbQBCYu5lCzsQCeQuA CMU I only stopped into the cute little shop for a quick gelato with a friend and I m glad that I did Its a very cute shop that offers food and gelato I tried the Mango Gelato and also the Salted Caramel Gelato and it was good I ll def revisit I d be very curious to try some of the tasty flat breads that were coming out of the kitchen area 
2ym-eeiBpKub6lmzdovd7Q CMU Nice selection of items good pricing and friendly atmosphere We ll be back 
2yr_PT9p_M1pZZmupRLwQQ CMU I was expecting a lot more from JT but realized that it is a restaurant that serves both chinese and korean but not in a fusion type of way It merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu The idea was cute They even have typical chinese lunch specials The deco needs upgrading and dusting some lighting or even natural light its like walking in a cave and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air I had a craving for comfort food and ordered Jajangmyeon and grilled calamari The tea and water was served as I sat down I went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people The calamari came out promptly and the Jajangmyeon took a little longer The portions were huge What took the longest and annoyed me the most I was the only one left at the restaurant was waiting for the check Why does waiting for the check take 45 minutes They never came the clear the table or walked by so that I could signal that I needed the check I should have just walked out The food was okay but I seriously needed to get in and out of there in a certain time frame that they didn t help with You may want to consider going when you have a 2 hour lunch break 
2ZV9nuYkoB2MXgHNxqk5hw CMU As you have read from all of the other reviews the service at Brasserie 33 stinks That s all you can really say Some say if you are looking for gourmet not service go here Seriously If I m spending the money on a roasted chicken I should get served in an appropriate amount of time I shouldn t have to wave down a water boy for a refill of water I shouldn t have to flag down a server just for my check our dinner plates were taken away 30 minutes prior no one asked if we wanted dessert The food Yes it s good The service will keep me from going back I can get better service at Denny s 
2Zvoz_89Xa1rwsE9wjA5Kw CMU I moved to Bloomfield in April and being Italian and loving Italian food I thought that Little Italy would be a good fit I was wrong Until tonight I have found that every Italian restaurant I ve tried has left much to be desired from Del s atrocious food to the over hyped Pleasure Bar I had not found an Italian joint I liked Lombardozzi I have not clue why I had not tried you until tonight I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal We started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection and no rubbery feel which is a positive because 99 of places outside the east coast can t to calamari to save their lives I had the gnocchi with red sauce only sauce option which kind of irks me because gnocchi is great with a pesto with meatballs The gnocchi is homemade and to die for and the sauce is pretty good too I m a sauce snob nobody beats my mothers or grandmothers and the meatballs were as good as I remembered Great food experience but the service was at best bad The waitress took over five minutes to get our drink order and just kind of seemed annoyed at the whole working thing I will be back because there is no Italian food in Bloomfield that even comes close to Lombardozzi 
2_Mssa9TjCxdS9MVleSLiA CMU Today was my third time eating something from Szmidt s and it keeps getting better From a plain turkey or tuna salad sandwich to what is probably the best chicken salad I ve ever had mango and feta everything is so fresh and delicious My husband has tried the Sanchez rage which is ridiculous but amazing and absolutely loved it The bread is to die for as well Fresh thick slices of homemade rye bread or homemade white rolls I m kind of concerned that this is literally at the end of my street I will probably be there way too often 
3-9KGPAv5BB-88dmcts1xQ CMU This is a great BYO spot with outdoor seating on Ellsworth The menu isn t very extensive but what they do have is very good and the prices are perfect Their lamb for the gyros and gyro salads is very flavorful and they give you a lot The service was a little slow but it was nice to not be interrupted constantly while eating It was a very relaxing meal and I will absolutely be going back I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were just a few more apps and or entrees to choose from It is definitely worth a try 
3-AkxDzgfA_xR41I0k7Xtg CMU Excellent lunch and desert crepes in a fun atmosphere Super tasty but a bit pricey and the place is usually quite crowded As long as you re not in a hurry this place is great Try a cappuccino with your lunch 
3-d70ebdrrTF_Blnybdy3Q CMU Do not go here if you are on a budget and or really hungry However if you have an expense account or are a guest of someone with an expense account as I was last night than this is a good option In fact this is the best sushi I ve had in Pittsburgh Umi is a part of the admirable big burrito group It s located above Soba It s up two long sets of stairs so if you are bringing someone handicapable or elderly they ll have trouble navigating the double staircases As I was walking up the stairs last night I noticed the painted large waves on the walls I believe Umi is japanese for big wave maybe Our reservation was for 6 30 and initially they only had the tatami tables where you sit on the ground and your feet dangle in a hole in the floor These tables are probably okay for date night but would have been weird with two business associates Luckily a table opened up If it s this busy on a Tuesday I suggest a reservations Anyways the rest of the space is very nice with a sushi bar with about 5 seats as soon as you enter and very warm colors with a few scuptures and a waterfall in the middle of the dining room The service was pretty good There was nothing particularly memorable I started with a Mark West Chardonnay which was okay and priced under 10 They also have a good selection of warm and cold sake I started with the white tuna sashimi which was a few slices of super fresh melt in your mouth tuna with a nice soy sauce and just the right amount of wasabi Matt tried the shrimp tempura which was perfectly breaded quickly fried light shrimp with veggies This was a good deal at 12 Keith had the lobster soup which had a few big chunks of lobster and a nice broth I ordered the toro tartar with caviar which was probably a teaspoon of super creamy fatty tuna and a touch of caviar This was really rich and one of the most expensive teaspoon serving I ve ever had at 21 for such a small amount Keith had some noodle dish which he said was good and actually was pretty reasonable but again it s noodles Matt ordered the strip steak tataki which was about 1 1 2 ounces of prime steak served with a sweet soy sauce It was delicious but again 20 for less than a 2 oz serving I stuck with sashimi The lobster sashimi was great and had some type of flavored sauce instead of just soy The salmon and tuna were also amazing They were cut perfectly and tasted like they were just pulled from the sea Overall a really good sashimi dinner however I have to admit I did stop for pizza a few hours later 
325t7hB5zAwRMbkRAE3qSg CMU I ll echo the finally good BBQ in Pittsburgh sentiment albeit with less experience hunting after the first few rave reviews I read on other places came up with disappointment Never again will I miss BBQ in this town Yinzburgh just does it right by the meat this is meat that tastes like meat and not like sauce You can tell they are cooking with love because the favors are all there and the staff is clearly proud of their product I m solidly hooked on the honey mustard sauce but all three are downright tasty Do yourself a favor and at least give them a try you won t regret it and I can bet you ll be as hooked as I am 
32GjJfEmo9IYikCoL_4hxA CMU Wasn t that hungry and was looking for a good places for alcohol and appetizers and stumbled upon Harris Fun times NICE Unique selection of beers I m no expert but I hadn t heard of 3 4 of them and the waiter recommended a tasty blueberry one Decent spicy mussels Not the best I ve ever had but be honest with yourself you re not going to find awesome seafood in Pittsburgh Wasn t rubbery at all and the sauce was nice Tasty perfectly sized bite sized cheeseburger appetizers Wings that weren t too greasy yet very flavorful We were there for bacon night Who would have thought eating strips of plain ol bacon would be good It is Nice patio Not too packed so you can talk yet busy enough that you feel like you re part of the action Friendly attentive helpful waiter WEIRD Took forever to get drinks and food My coworker said the wings weren t legit jerk chicken like advertised The patio was a little too romantic Meaning it was so dark I couldn t read the menu except by holding it up to the little candle at our table Ditto when we went inside for a bit Maybe that d be awesome if I was on a sexy date instead of with two coworker dudes I wasn t All in all I d come back if I was looking for a date place to have a light dinner or a place to chill with some close friends 
344x0dQQGm8j-hP0x5OYsQ CMU Good burgers and mac cheese 
34zz_4mS152QUqDI3jy47w CMU Sandwich quality is equivalent to make it yourself at home except I could do it better Maybe I should have opted for one of the oven roasted but the regular sandwiches were overpriced The tomato bisque was good and would be the only reason I would ever return The service was less than helpful It s okay if you don t know the answer but it d be nice if they asked someone else instead of disregarding my question and giving me something I told them I didn t want Also if you re vegan the options are really limited to essentially soup or chili I was expecting a lot more variety since the logo and name imply a healthier alternative but like everything else it was a disappointment The price is equivalent to panera which is overpriced but the quality and service do not make up for such high prices Looks like I ll be sticking to Panera or even subway At least subway charges a decent price and actually offers more flavor 
37dQoA_1pf-3JfxvxUyvVw CMU Mediocre food and tacky decor would be the most generous way of describing this place Convenience to Pitt may be the only thing this place has going for it and perhaps they re hoping that your average student isn t discerning enough to notice that everything else is lacking My chicken parmesan was dry and bland and it came with a side of heavily salted boiled or steamed vegetables summer squash and zucchini So heavily salted that I m retching a little thinking about them The waitress seated us under the air conditioner and when we asked to move because were so cold she commented on the fact that we weren t the first party she had to move as a result Why she couldn t have seated us elsewhere in the mostly empty restaurant is beyond me This place was a poor welcome to Italian food in Pittsburgh and I can only hope my next experience is better 
37KzgNPozbRpixRH9kUH3A CMU Service was incredible I ordered the hotcakes with strawberries that they re known for and a side of the lyonnaise potatoes to try them Those potatoes are delicious The hotcakes are very good as well Give them a try 
37WueYIeisAVl-jRI_LVXg CMU Our reservation was originally scheduled at 830 though we werent seated until nearly 930 i was an out of towner and felt no need to sugar coat how i felt about being made to wait on a leather couch for an hour after 2 glasses of Piscoe when we were seated our wait staff and the host profusely appologized for the wait they were very attentive thereafter and comped our first few rounds but i think it was because i pushed my boobs up mentioned that they should the food presentation was excellent and the taste was slightly above average the shrimp and grits were subpar the Frog was more fishy than i think was acceptable and covered in fava beans although we ordered no salads we were comped one of every one on the menu the duck was excellent as a main course i ordered the suckling pig the meat was tendor and well executed though i thought it looked more like mousakka i was really happy with the presentation i thought for sure i was going to be seeing a little Wilber or Babe on my plate after witnessing what the frog legs looked like Dessert was great im a big softy for creme brulee and they had their own version of tapioca creme brulee French press to cap off the night after all my free Piscoes was excellent All in all if we hadnt been comped so much i think our tab would have been close to 4 or 500 for the 3 of us our bill ran about 160 so i was content 
38YM64TDEgh3jh_v-2GsyQ CMU Get a square pizza and a family of four can eat for days 
39OnPB3xLzLU8Vd-ppW71A CMU its a alright place servers are wonderful but didn t quite enjoy the food 
3a4Arz49wCDwCSOf-Yz2Dw CMU Really great option for cantonese food in Oakland I ve never ordered from the buffet it doesn t look too good but they make an a ok congee no donuts unfortunately reasonably good roast duck pork and the fish maw soup is also very nice It s near my work and I like coming here for a late lunch when it s not crowded The interior is kind of beat drop ceiling battered furniture etc but I really like the laid back atmosphere This is my favorite place for a secret 90 minute leisurely lunch on a weekday with friends and sharing a few dishes Just arrive after 1pm 
3Alivwef_atDoRNZDhdYfw CMU If you like thin New York style pizza this is the place to go The slices are huge The dining area was clean and the people working there were friendly and helpful It was probably one of the best slices of pizza I ve gotten in Pittsburgh Believe me I ve eaten a lot of pizza 
3AmE8bFv2EEZPJ0D9ZRU0Q CMU I haven t eaten here since they moved locations but I am surprised at how many people rate this place as 5 stars Sure you can get a sushi roll for 4 but it has 15 micrograms of fish in it These were the smallest rolls I have ever seen anywhere Come on people I know Pittsburgh doesn t have much Asian cuisine but when you ve tasted the nectar of real sushi you ll realize how much this place doesn t compare Then update your review My friend and I were completely disappointed when we ate here Plus the service was horrible that night 
3aozkaXNQX4Cpbah3JqoTw CMU Out of my three day 3 state bar crawl this was my favorite bar Service was good the beer selection wasnt amazing but okay and they had shuffle board But what sold me was the Silky s had that homey feel to it 
3ASyX-fKAhHuOhT_IWRO_g CMU This place is a dump I guess if you really want to go to a hookah cafe and can t make it over to hookah bookah this has to be your only choice I think it s dirty and overpriced If you are coming into the city for a hookah lounge just do yourself and your group a favor and stay away from this one Take a ride down to E Carson and go to Hookah Bookah Much better 
3b2ebIafYE1c3DOXyFMtPg CMU Uncle Sams used to be a major part of my diet I lived right around the corner The subs are good but tend to induce comas and heart attacks The bread is nice and generally the ingredients are fresh The inside is clean and friendly The only real complaint I have is that most of the subs all taste the same maybe it s the shared grill which isn t bad just boring 
3BJfMSecJqtFuIQVrxnYfw CMU I was here today for lunch Our waitress was brand new and so we had to be a little patient but she was very friendly and will catch on quickly That said I have no complaints about the service but the food was not anything to write home about I ve eaten here a few times in the past and I recommend going with one of their top sellers noted on the menu they seem to be top sellers for a reason Deviating from those doesn t pay off But they do have outdoor seating and it is a great place for people watching 
3c1yP93FdZOh7SaNtwaZUA CMU One of my favs in pgh I usually get girasole salad with chicken but they have seasonal specials and it is just an awesome place 
3cL1VzM07QxyBKXRcxrITA CMU I ve never been to F F for the late night half price food but have been there a couple times for dinner and drinks The beer selection is awesome I personally love the fire baked brie which comes out nice and warm and has honey drizzled all over it When you cut the breading the cheese just melts out I m a big fan of the Porky s Revenge Pizza and the Filler Up pizza The burgers are decent and I usually get the sweet potato fries with them because they are so much better than regular fries Overall a good place to eat If you do want to go for half price late night special make sure you get there early because there is usually a line outside 
3CtYULgHhN-MXus_QoNA0A CMU Strolling around Pittsburgh for my first time every and this was the place I arrived at thanks for the recommendation fellow Yelpers The service was very friendly and attentive The manager owner was also extra nice The fried mozzarella with balsamic vinegar was an interesting touch I had never seen before The balsamic added a little more fun and flavor to what s normally a pretty standard dish The gnocchi with prosciutto and white wine sauce was very delicious but a little heavy for me The bread served before the appetizers was bland and uninteresting The olive oil had some peppers and spices in it that I didn t care for The atmosphere was very intimate and charming with dark lighting and small eating areas The paper table settings were kinda neat they weren t too casual 
3cyJd-Jc_JjFQTPiwRfseA CMU As a Greenfield resident and the grand daughter of a Philadelphia butcher I have to support this place The food is really good and the staff is super friendly I think the perogies are one of the best in Pittsburgh and the Fredo Goombah is my fave sandwich on the menu Everything is really fresh and they actually have a really good canned soda selection I m lucky to have them right down the street 
3c_6OguTwKChp_4j4mU_QQ CMU I feel like I have to say Every time I get a sandwich here now that I know to ignore the rotisserie chicken it is completely awesome We had a bit of a weird waitress last time we were there though 
3d4ih51RCg4_HVpA-RULdA CMU Good quality good price Not very spicy Cute waitress 
0MWF-unzCb8tHkZa5K4_wg Columbia Such potential for this place We watched it go up and couldn t wait to try it Unfortunately though my turkey burger was decent my friend s gumbo was so abysmal she had to send it back it just wasn t gumbo In the summer it was as crowded as The Frying Pan only Harlem Tavern attempts to provide table service outside unlike The Frying Pan And the waitstaff is just overwhelmed during this time We were ready to leave to actually go down the block to Bier for their truffle fries to salvage our lunch and we had to wait so long ti find the waitress ask for the check receive the check get our cards back that Bier was between serving food when we arrived Sad I wonder if this trip s disappointment was just growing pains and I guess I d try it again at some point if only to support a local business 
0NCpgXCWQmx2YGitZYsWVA Columbia This is the best pizza in the neighborhood it s affordable and tasty real cheese nice ingredients for the most part Stick to the pizza though So far the salad and pastas have been really disappointing And avoid the bacon it s strangely gristly That said I figure a good pizza place that delivers to Harlem warrants four stars for this place 
0nFadolPQdWkDT52qylq8Q Columbia Five stars for saving the neighborhood This area has been a wasteland of crappy bodegas since Floridita closed a couple of years ago Falafel on Broadway is delicious and they have a lot of variety I eat here 2 or 3 times a week and never get bored Also along with the tasty foods try their Turkish coffee Its the real deal 
0nItDOsytv5h-AVrBgQBeQ Columbia Bought a Living Social deal to this place and showed up for dinner To our disappointment the deal wasn t valid until 2 days later We were already there so we decided to stay Horrible idea First of all the prices are outrageous not what is listed online A burger costs 12 and doesn t even come with sides or french fries Second the servings are really small which makes you feel worse about the outrageous price you re paying Not the worst restaurant I ve been to the food is actually okay But it s just NOT worth how much they charge 
0nK6hzoDmvcUhVpb5pyMlg Columbia Frankies with chickpea and potatoes are fantastic I had a lamb one too but was pretty disappointed at how dry the meat was I d stick with anything with peas in them Cheap delicious late night eat which is sort of scarce in this neighborhood 
0nOblZaNYVYR_ZMujwnjhQ Columbia I joined the Dominican for lunch the other day at Mel s It was a better lunch than usual that s for darn sure I had a simple Classic Burger and he had something with bacon and cheese on it And we ordered the Atomic Fries They were indeed atomic And delish We both broke out in a sweat So worth it The burgers are juicy and perfectly seasoned Not too salty They also have a pretty fantastic selection of beers both on tap and by the bottle I saw they have growlers though we didn t partake I walked away so full and so happy Call me cheap if you will but I find the place to be more than a little over priced Especially at lunch I don t regret it but it was certainly the most expensive lunch I ve had in a while I wish they had either a lunch or midday happy hour deal to address some of the cost I would go back more often if I could more easily avoid buyer s remorse Yum yum That is all 
0nZhUcpazr7rgRxnA-cldA Columbia I love this place The owner is GREAT The staff is friendly And the food is amazing Keep it up Crepes 
0ogB3T-kab3TRvrkGpTPkA Columbia Best brunch EVER My friend would not stop talking about this place so we all finally went here to see what the hype was all about and holy bejeezus it lived up to that hype My friend ordered the gnocchi pancakes and it was to die for My GF ordered the spaghetti and meatball and it was pretty damn good even if I am not parse to tomato sauce I ordered the chicken pasta in white sauce with truffle oil Dude that truffle sauce was pretty amazing I didn t think it would have made a difference but it did Ended the meal with probably the softest and moistest coconut cake you that will ever touch your lips It probably fell off a sterling silver platter in heaven and landed directly on our mortal plate at Pisticci s 
0OGyJbq8m_T6OX8AV0fhQA Columbia This place is ree donk cue less Incredible crepes for a unbelievable price I had a crepe with Nutella caramel and fresh tangerines My wife had a crepe with Nutella Caramel and spiced diced apples Needless to say we came in our pants it was THAT ree donk cue less The only reason I give it a 4 5 is that there were flies EVERYWHERE It was pretty effing dirty when you walk in The windows had finger print marks that looked like they had been there for well over a month I don t suggest you order for delivery which they do because once your food gets to you it may be cold Crepes aren t known for keeping warm for very long So get em and scarf em down but enjoy the diabetic coma you will be in from the orgasmic sugary rush 
0p5O2yZj_iyOlf1n5Oqg1w Columbia The food is just really good from the macaroni and cheese to the burgers It s a bit overpriced so it loses a star by me but you leave satisfied And they deliver 
0PiMjmzVMqR0vByEgEaadA Columbia I am not sure how to give this place 3 5 stars but that s what I would do if I could V T is good the pizza tastes great and the sauce is tasty but they tend to rush delivery orders so your food may be undercooked To advise ask them to make the pizza well done and wait another 5 minutes The eggplant pizza is my favorite but even when I was a little kid we ordered the everything pizza and I loved it We had their number memorized and the food hasn t changed except now I don t eat meat I still think this is the best pizza in the immediate area 
0pLYU_LcTilD1zwyjZBl_g Columbia I never realized how great Ethiopian food was It seems the ingredients in Ethiopian food are very similar to the stuff used in South Asian cooking Either way its all very good The wait staff and bartender are all very cool and nice people If you re in the mood for something different this is the perfect place to go Good food good atmosphere and a unique dining experience 
0PqISHQH88IiwYG45JwFjw Columbia I had lunch here 2 days ago and I didn t leave satisfied at all I ordered the avocado chicken panini but it took soo long The way to order is confusing for a newbie Ordering is just like a deli or a restaurant where they have different kinds of cuisine pizza salads wraps etc I think you order at the counter that has the menu above My friend ordered a salad and I promptly ordered a panini at the same place It literally took 15 to make and my friend was already half way through We only had a 30 min lunch break The sandwich itself was meh The avocado kept slipping off It wasn t a well made panini They put in a ton of avocado in though The grilled chicken was lemony It came with chips in the plastic container Not a bog fan of then but whatever To wrap it up food meh decor okay seating good staff nice Ps Someone behind me ordered a chicken cutlet hero To make it the took a chickencutlet in a plastic blaggy and microwaved it In A Plastic Bag No me gusta I mean I don t expect them to bread the chicken then and there but the plastic bag was too much Maybe I ll come back if I m truly desperate 
0pZNmVaS0xgHWG02giuxoQ Columbia Had brunch here one Sat morning five tables occupied when we were seated waited one hour for cold pancakes and french toast A friend at Columbia says that when their dept goes to Havana Central for lunch its understood that it will take at least an hour and a half Maybe slow as shit service gives points for authenticity but when in Rome The more traditional dishes ropa vieja tostones empanadas arroz con pollo are adequate and sometimes bland The Jazz Brunch on weekends is very loud and not always jazz The coffee is bitter and the staff painfully apathetic With better Cuban joints on the UWS Havana Central leaves little to recommend itself 
0Q7Aph9TLRG7Vg-fcC-qZw Columbia Tom s isn t as bad as it s made out to be but it s not good either Stay with simple things and you ll be fine Also you cannot leave without getting a milkshake Ask for it malted if that s your thing it s not mine The breakfast is decent and the service is quick if gruff Late at night you will find this place packed Sitting at the counter can be an experience but the milkshake is really worth it as the server glares at you Be prepared for some drunk Columbia students making a ruckus This is the closest diner to Columbia and it has simple things grilled cheese cheese fries eggs and toast that you can t get closer to campus at least for cheaper If you re looking for an actually decent diner I d head down to Metro Diner on 100th Street Also cross to the other side of Broadway to avoid being in the background of some random tourist s photo 
0qTPIpBMCkOogRQay2AdYQ Columbia CONS Snooty attitude Strong exclusive hipster vibe esp at the communal tables Service is unfriendly and takes FOREVER Pretty expensive PROS The food from what I ve experienced is a bit greasy but quite delicious Not sure if it s worth the long wait though The coffee is fabulous 
0r13zHrHhh77lijaqA6fhg Columbia One of THE best banana blue berry crepes I ve ever had Delicious 
0R4y7MOO_lD-0alCA68XEQ Columbia Around Columbia University Morningside Need Asian comfort food Come to the Mill It s got weird decor that is for certain The decor seems like something out of the Scholastic I SPY book I SPY a Singer sewing machine Nothing mind blowing about the food I wouldn t trek here for Korean but the food is solid and it scratches the itch 
0rEmsAOFOnJoJbSvL1Jpmw Columbia We have been going here for years and have always had a great meal It is BYOB major bonus points in my opinion and they have a pre fix for 20 or 25 appetizer and entree They use sustainable products even the drinking glasses are made out of recycled corn product and the food I think is organic They have great veggie options like seitan meatloaf as well We highly recommend this lil gem of a place 
0RfQEwdgulOlT9Cn491YpA Columbia Order snafu to start but very friendly staff Had the special which was sundried tomato ricotta ravioli as take out for lunch Excellent prices in line with NYC 
0rpxEEKoVL2h8RzKvW7CIg Columbia The food is OK What makes it special in this neighborhood is that it is so cheap It s fun to sit on the roof or near the huge windows on a nice day Service is usually nice and fast A good place for lunch 
0Ru1MDcfH-hWCH7KkxXlDg Columbia Don t bother 
0rZifozwhaDJ6KMGACQWhQ Columbia I stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch with my father We were searching for a place thar serves Ful an Eritrean dish The ful was tasty and good The portions were more than enough Food Service was great 
0s1-h27kOT0GGXEutOgRGQ Columbia This restaurant is a solid 4 stars Upon arriving we were seated in a loud plate clanking section where my delicate nose was drawn to the smell of cleaners and pine sol We asked one of the cool looking managers wearing ear pieces if we could be seated elsewhere and they promptly moved us to another section The glass of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc we had was smooth and fruity complementing the rest of our courses Must get the grilled octopus appetizer My husband and I both order the specials Hubby got skirt steak which I found a bit fattier than usual and I got the braised lamb pasta special My pasta was delicious but it was missing a salty ingredient perhaps parmesan to make it out of this world I asked the waiter for parmesan twice but he forgot The dish was satisfying enough for me to finish without the added cheese Overall our experience at Vareli was a pleasant one 
0S4mVrhhSfTsKRtBF_W_BQ Columbia I love this little cozy place This place was highly recommended by the owners of the B B during our NYC trip back in Dec Yeah I m a bit slow at updating bash me bash me We were immediately seated to our table We noticed that everyone around us had a delish breakfast entree I had the Kitchenette Special 7 which includes free coffee until 11am My partner had the Farmhouse Breakfast Each breakfast dish was perfect Coffee was tasty Service was great If I lived in NYC The Kitchenette would be one of my fave places for breakfast and lunch Awww I m so missing NYC right now 
0S759FCT4joMGAtfH_KcgQ Columbia IF your main criteria for a slice are that it be over sized and cheap and IF you think you d enjoy pizza whose taste and crust mouthfeel approximate sheet rock left out in the rain slathered with Ragu and Polly O mozzarella and IF you are heinously hammered craving grease and have just emerged from the subway on 110 and Bway and Koronet s lights resemble an oasis in the desert then by all means grab a slice here If on the other hand as a NYer you relish your proximity to myriad quality pizza places and wish to exercise a modicum of discernment go elsewhere 
0SeZDjZ64IO0nMiJI2u4Yw Columbia Went here twice already and loved both times The Bagel Deluxe looks excellent I had their Quesedilla and Fries once with cheese once w gravy I liked the one with cheese better Second time I went I ordered the Thursday special with baked macaroni and cheese which came with soup and salad With a small appetite I had to box it up and ate it up in three meals around 10 dollars plus tax and tip Pretty good The service is always good Waiters and waitresses are both helpful Enjoyed my times there From what I hear other than their delicious dessert their milkshakes are heavenly too I m saving that for next time Downside CASH ONLY 
0sk7vYafr-JnYpPx9tvRnQ Columbia I have a lot of experience going to Haakon s and I would recommend it for drinks dinner I get something different every time but at the bar I get the wings desert cookies or pumpkin pie catering or private parties I ve use both services to anyone Atmosphere sophisticated without the extra fee The Chef is the best cook and will work with you They stay pretty busy and Chef likes to be on the floor with his customers if he can He is a fun and warm guy even though at first he seems stressed because he likes everyone to be perfectly happy and to feel welcome I am there 3 times a week and use them for 90 of our parties I had a Thanksgiving party and Halloween Party for 75 people each On Halloween the party food was suppose to end at 11 00pm James the Chef kept the food coming out until brought out new appetizers till 11 15 unheard of anywhere in the city and without an extra charge For Thanksgiving we ended up having less people show up than expected and Chef made sure everyone got seconds which was amazing because the food is AWESOME Chef is also helping me with a fundraiser So it s a great place food atmosphere and people 
0SQ4RiwCBoaUC2qTLgq9mg Columbia Two words imitation scallops I never even knew such things existed and a reasonable diner would not imagine that he would be relegated to eating imitation scallops parmigiana for 16 not even in Manhattan Nevertheless there are some gems on the menu The pizza is reliably good The complimentary bread is quite tasty crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside I also like the broiled lamb chops simple and lightly seasoned and served with the part that most restaurants don t serve the tiramisu the chicken soup and minestrone soup On the other hand the pasta and side dishes are average The hardness of the steamed peas reminded me of stale Japanese style fried peas Overall 2 5 
0sQWQawQvvbwBIrM38OQCA Columbia The happy hour specials are great 3 for some great beers like Stone IPA and Dogfish Head but the food is uninspiring and overpriced for what you get I d recommend this place to grad students who are looking for a cheap good drink before heading elsewhere for dinner I usually find myself in the lounge area which is a little less formal than the main dining area It s pretty comfortable and I like the cavernous exposed brick ambiance The big drawback to sitting here is that the DJs and bartenders keep the music at a rather high volume for 5 30pm on a weekday It would be nice if the management monitored the volume more closely so that customers could carry on a conversation without having to shout 
0SQxys9TPaqGkTKvIqv3eg Columbia Went here for lunch today had the famous blueberry pancakes They were good but I dunno about great They are extremely sweet and I love sweet things The syrup that even comes with it is like melted caramel Again sweet My friend had a chicken sandwich which he said tasted like they used real quality ingredients The restaurant itself is very trendy and a nice addition to Morningside Heights although if you are a college student you might wanna go to another more affordable restaurant 
0T1rAbqy1arLsgM9ZKlrqQ Columbia Tried a few things and I think the Unda Aloo with egg is the best The ones with protein chicken and shrimps were alright I think they do vegetarian stuff better Mango lassi was good but nothing extraordinary 
0taEWvSQraGOs6hKgSWrNw Columbia I ve been coming here on and off since 2007 and can say the food is always excellent and you can t beat the price Lunch specials even on the weekends large portions and fresh great tasting food I m not a huge fan of Thai food but this place seems to do it a bit differently than the standard Manhattan Thai places If you re in the area I recommend it 
0tcxtoau4SlHWrpnosiAQQ Columbia There is only one reason I ever go to Apple Tree the chipotle chicken Strokos Milano s Subsconscious Westside and HamDel all have salad bars And while you ll probably get more food at Westside and better value at Milano s the chipotle chicken just makes my salad so much better than the surrounding delis that I ll always pick Apple Tree first Everything else about it is average typical NY corner market The lines for the cash register could be less awkwardly structured but that s a small gripe Story one time I dumped my entire salad on the floor of my friend s apartment He picked through it and ate the chipotle chicken off the floor The chicken is that good Or I need new friends 
0TeNSlvvHa7W8OlCiSCJTw Columbia Picked a good day to come Monday Taco flight day So I was able to order four different tacos to try chicken carne asada chorizo and carnitas for 12 They also had a beer flight but im not into beer so I skipped They had a good selection of margaritas but no specials on them They also had negra modelo on tap which my bf loves The decor is cute and colorful with images of La Loteria Luchadores etc The taco I liked best was the carne asada but did not LOVE it They also offer three tacos for 11 75 for LUNCH I dont think I could order 2tacos for 8 50 that s 4 25 per taco yikes I would return for a snack but not a complete meal I would like to see some drink specials that would entice me to come back Not my favorite taco place but somewhere I can return to if the mood strikes 
0tgsiDq5G8lDZL7oNLdDTw Columbia When it comes to ingesting raw fish and other questionable ingredients you had better investigate the place that is producing such items first before you do so Taking my own advice I ordered from Suma after I d read the Yelp reviews thoroughly And my investigation yielded mostly accurate results Yes the sushi is decent and yes they do deliver However had it not been for the wasabi that came with my Spider Rolls no not spider deep fried crab cucumber lettuce and avocado then I would ve been a little disappointed But it was definitely fresh I ll give them that And 9 for 5 rolls isn t TOO bad but a lot of their other items are higher priced However the delivery time was not what I expected it to be given the fact that I live a grand total of two blocks away Maybe it was the snow storm A lot of other reviews have mentioned how much they like this place in the absence of any other real alternative and while I d agree that this probably one of the only places in the area that you can get decent sushi I don t normally award more stars for a oh you didn t suck as badly as I thought you were going to award On days like today where I barricaded myself indoors I d order from Suma again But when the summertime hits I ll walk the 10 blocks down to Whole Foods and buy their sushi instead 
0tPFjaaZsElx6X49Yf6n1g Columbia Based on our visit today this newly opened restaurant places above Ozen and Asia Kan in the Asian fusion sushi delivery arena The restaurant is a pleasant addition to the Harlem Morningside area The atmosphere and type of food are nothing new except for the addition of hibachi Did not try the hibachi but will definitely go back to try it In general there were no surprises PROS bigger portions both the dinner dish of a Thai curry and the sashimi entree were surprisingly generous even the sushi a la carte seemed to have slightly larger portion sizes fresher fish than usual including the scallops and sea urchin which are prone to tasting off pricing fair CONS timing still a little off a bit of a wait for food dishes did not arrive together staff seems a bit hasty and not quite on the ball yet my friend had to ask for cutlery which was delivered in two parts The appetizer to get rock shrimp Delicious and crispy coated in a pleasing mayo spicy sauce Currently I think this place does rank higher than the average sushi place The only question is can they keep up the good work They ve only been open for 3 days 
0U0_O_7JSbpf9nHrpHJT-g Columbia I see that there is a lot of mix reviews on this place The only reason I didn t give this place a 5 star is because the restaurant was so packed that my friend and I had to sit at tall seats by a small counter The service was alright We went for brunch I had the sweet potato waffles which was pretty good and my friend had the baked vanilla bean brulee bread toast which was heavenly We also ordered the turkey sausage but it was very dry For a more thorough review check my blog http greenmilktea wordpress com 
0u1mypdyNJghC20NkyEPbg Columbia Been there twice and ordered from them I have no problem with the food The corn with the cheese and the spices is amazing I ve tried the chorizo tacos and the pork butt don t ask tacos which were also tasty Additionally their house margarita is good especially with the smoky salt rim That being said it is beyond me why you can t get chips and salsa at a time other than fiesta hour Seriously I think we talked the waiter into it the first time we went but it shouldn t require a drawn out conversation to obtain chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant 
0uBxHmkg_QhZK1K_NILmsA Columbia Went there on sunday with my two coworkers and first thing host said was you have 20 minutes to order before we close the kitchen We thought ok we want coffee and desert anyways We sat down and 35 minutes later we asked a waitress if she can help us because no one came to us and she had the worst attitude asked us what coffee we wanted and we asked to please see menu She actually never came back Bus boy started sweeping under our feet while we were still sitting at the table We decided to address this to the host and she kept talking on the phone smiled and said sorry So thank you for the free water and bread and the worst service I have ever received Mc Donalds and Burger King provide better service I would never ever come back or recommend anyone to go there Thank God I did not spend a penny 
0ucn52zcu0VH2Bq0nQBT9A Columbia what you order is not what you get You want french toast with blueberries strawberries and seasonal fruit like the menu lists Order that and you will receive a few blueberries and a ton of gross lardy filler in between 2 pieces of greasy bread for 15 Mention to the rude waitress that it is uh different from the menu and you will hear too rich for you huh coffee is NASTY But enjoy it because it wil never get refilled and yes you pay for that Over and over people write this place is out of ingredients and it is true But they dont have the decency to tell you that their new method is making something else gross and giving it to you You can go up to Tom s and have 6 french toast You can go to many places on the UWS and get great french toast Avoid this place at all costs I left 25 lighter and hungry They charge downtown Manhattan prices but give you something Bubba from Arkansas made from the left over swine fat Avoid 
0uTB94ar2sXGJY74NPy5iA Columbia I ve come here a couple times for brunch I have had a variety of dishes the waffles used in the eggs benedict are a bit too big and overwelming The service is kind of sucky but I usually go just to pick up some pastries I only like the brioche Definitely a hit and miss kind of place But there s wifi if you want to get some work done 
0uWiHQafTFHRn_7HD2YIaA Columbia BIGGGG good NY experience but the pizza was alriiiiight nothing spectacular I like my pizza cheesier quality was a little low too much flour remained on the crusts and bottom I would go to say you ve experienced a pizza slice that big but DO remember that heartburn will occur Also skip on fries over greased straight out of freezer didn t enjoy it 
0v27guP0PiiJoKcedHzTow Columbia GF and I order Thai market for delivery yay they deliver to us all the way up at 123rd and 8th I very much enjoyed my beef Pad See Ew Noodles were cooked just right and the flavoring was delicious My GF s panang curry with shrimp was delicious and the rice was great too I had not objections to the portion size of my beef Pad See Ew nor did my GF for her panang curry as other reviewers have complained about The delivery service was fast and reliable The reason this is four stars instead of five is that we were both disappointed by the Papaya Salad Just didn t taste right for some reason 
0vMt3iVzNWcge96yCsArzw Columbia First off This is not a flashy restaurant I probably wouldn t have gone here had the owner not come up to me while I was looking at the menu for V T and Columbia Cottage and asked me and my family to come in and try his place because it was family friendly I m glad he did This place is like the traditional americanized mexican food restaurant with a cuban puerto rican dominican influence that is common here in New York due to those communities being well established here The beans are black not pinto but that s ok because they do a competant job preparing the food I was pleased to see that they serve breakfast including chorizo with eggs which used to be impossible to find in manhattan I m definately going to come back and try it The service was good There wern t too many people in the place so the Owner waited on us and was very attentive The owner even offered to deliver to people in line for the Concert For Peace at Saint John the Divine accrosss the street The guacamole was fresh the rice had NOT been sitting around for hours and everything seemed made to order with fresh ingredients I especially liked that they didn t pile a mountain of cheese on everything and were confisdent in the flavor of the food itself Like I said this place is not flashy I didn t order anything to drink other than a jarritos but this is not a place where you would go to have drinks with dinner If you want that kind of Mexican food experience go downtown or to Hell s Kitchen This isn t a margarita bar or a beer joint so don t expect to come in and see or be a drunk college girl dancing on the tables 
0W88biFbzMfiyZ-SvS0v7g Columbia My friends and I had tickets to see Tracy Morgan at the Apollo so we stopped here for a quick dinner before the show The dining room is small but is dimly lit I think it would be a nice place for an unpretentious date So my friends had seen Melbas on the Food Network show Bobby Flay s Throwdown where they competed to see who had the better chicken and waffles So we went there with great expectations and wanting to try the famous dish Well when I first received my plate I thought boy I m going to be hungry And as I slowly ate my waffle I thought this is pretty good but I didn t think the fried chicken was anything to write home about However the whole is greater than the sum of its parts When you combine the two and eat them in one bite now that is a good dish I don t know what it is about the crispy chicken skin maybe all the grease but it makes the waffle that much better Oh and by the way the dish was surprisingly filling 
0WD9kfa8-Qv3N0fsbzxb1A Columbia I ve been eating there since I was 5 I recommend their eggplant garlic pizza 
0Wj7jiSfvb4NvXw0uH-BDQ Columbia My go to lunch spot for hot and cold subs They have a broad array of selections with a 5 special every day The line can be pretty long during the lunch rush but if you stick with non peak times you ll get in and out quickly 
0WRO6ydIa80voAud5Rhpng Columbia Zoma presents a somber escape from the street although the ebony hued bar back lit liquor shelves stone tiles and vast candle lit white walls strike one initially as somewhat incongruous more like a bar in a posh boutique hotel than a local family restaurant Nevertheless the warmth and attention from the staff helps remove any trepidation the severe ambiance might have imbued The two of us shared a combination platter served with ample portions of beef lamb collard greens and spicy red lentils The lentils and beef were our favorite followed by the collard greens The lamb was our least favorite as the meat overpowered the other flavors Overall the sauces were well prepared and balanced In addition they also served a side of chili sauce that combined cardamon and chili to make for a rich and flavorful accompaniment This was our second time at the restaurant and I m sure will be back again 
0WYjPMbl_lmXnI_XHAhoVw Columbia Massawa is not a core shaker but a really decent place to get your Ethiopian fix I ve seen Eritrean and Ethiopian people eat here so I suppose it s somewhat authentic though I m no expert I rather liked the spiciness of their tebsi special and the buttery laced texture of the stewed pumpkin Their lentils and carrot sides are okay The most important thing I must say is the fact that their injera is hot wonderfully tangy and layered on the plate Plus they don t take forever to bring you more Zoma an Ethiopian place with raving reviews on Yelp could learn a lesson or two from Massawa Massawa may not be as hip but it s more genuine and understands exactly what I need comfort I like my injera piping hot and plated with decent portions of what I ordered 
0x3LSFmAtI3i1vu3BPCOHA Columbia I liked it I can t find one thing to complain about Food service and price were all on the money 
0x4tejZ_Yh0eLA4MA_SsgQ Columbia Love the calzones love the garlic knots love the atmosphere The only complaint is that the food can be a little bit bland but that s fine because they provide you with any salt or peppers or cheese you need to spice it up I visit every time I m in NYC 
0XaWwIZnqBo-BKfVaNFamg Columbia Three stars mainly for the food proximity to my house and the fact that it owns Caf Fresh the establishment that used to be there a hundred times over The food is consistently good and I like the space even though it s typically pretty dead which makes the lukewarm service a lot more prominent than it otherwise would be I ve been there for lunch and dinner lunch seemed overpriced 10 for a sandwich I still don t get that but dinner usually has the prix fixe option for 15 which is a good deal all things considered On the other hand the service I would agree is usually subpar I ve only ever seen three servers and none of them are particularly warm or gregarious I usually feel like I m being rushed by the waitstaff which isn t a good feeling when you just want to have a leisurely meal with a book The food comes out quickly enough but I have consistently felt like the waitstaff couldn t care less C mon guys you don t have enough traffic to warrant the I m tired complaint cheer up a bit My other main beef is that the hours in the summer are really inconsistent Morningside Heights is one of those neighborhoods that does suffer from the lack of students in the summer but it really would be nice if they posted clearer year round hours for those of us who stick around 
0xe26dYPnri1PLIwB5Fldw Columbia I was prepared not to like it since I read many negative reviews Thought the service was nice It wasn t that crowded when we went though I ordered the chicken bail creme spinach savory crepe I liked it Could have used more basil creme since it waskinda dry for me bbut I thought it was probably healthier My friend had the French toast and dessert crepe He like them Though nothing earth shattering All theitems were made fresh Note the place was not crowded 
0YfvPvcuQLCe9Nv9JbjqBg Columbia Second best garlic knots in the city The pizza is nothing special but it s consistent not too expensive and pretty yummy But for me going for pizza is always about the garlic knots 
0Z--a_IE8VrEEVqExpH7Og Columbia Had a delicous meal here The B combition is very filling as well as the appetizers The only drag was the spicy crepe pancake it was very greasy Overall this is a great restuarant 
0ZjKpIEVwo_4-0VsoEoMWQ Columbia Barry Bonds Jason Giambi Koronet Slice Gigantic pizza slices for 3 That s all you need to know 
0zpp5Aga__7c82UxDLOYHg Columbia As other yelpers have said it s a good college bar with a decent beer selection and a wide array of mixed drinks I got the Caipirinha expecting it to be watered down but they definitely don t skimp on the alcohol which is a plus Waiters bartenders are nice enough Some minor complaints are that yet again as everyone has said it is small Be sure to go in there knowing that there are only two unisex bathrooms with gigantic lines to get in You ll be holding it in for the majority of the night but the cramped space helps with that 
0zZm8zQEIOtyf7W3e8tAtg Columbia For the honey tej wine this places gets 5 stars The food is good but I felt that their tibs wett was average And why was the injera cold I expected more for the hype that Zoma received That said I ll probably come back with friends as I do feel that the place is a great intro into Ethiopian food Will update more later when I go back 
0zZs2Np3s7mKS117VVWpIA Columbia Oh how I wish Toast was good We live on the same block and I pass by it whenever I head out of my apartment We couldve had a great relationship Alas the burgers are nothing special and they always forget ingredients when you order takeout 
0z_avI8DqFsO1i2sj75jmA Columbia The atmosphere is a high end diner with outdoor seating and part of the menu is written on mirrors around the restaurant creating an almost Parisian ambiance The food is noticeably better and therefore more expensive than Tom s Restaurant but on a sunny afternoon it is worth it I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich which included swiss cheddar cheeses and tomatoes and fries I have always found that the secret to a good grilled cheese sandwich is the tomato and so I commend Deluxe for getting that right I believe everyone at the table enjoyed their sandwiches too but just to warn you If you arrive around 11 45am or even right at noon for lunch and you shouldn t have a problem Show up at 1 15 and you ll be waiting until tea time 
0_2-rjEMdkVHUEnr-qWbKw Columbia Average Japanese sushi place Nothing special but it wasn t horrible either 
0_9fPRaoB_Xp-ix4syb_8Q Columbia The food only tastes somewhat decent when you re raving drunk Sober it s pretty bad The only saving grace is the BLT Milkshakes should be split between three an order for one will make you sick Try the pistachio or strawberry milkshakes if you must order one Remember Seinfeld didn t actually shoot the interior for a good reason nothing special here 
0_rtJS3NmadjRKZ_JBWHbw Columbia IN SHORT There are other better Mexican restaurants in the city But if you do come here get something cheap and just enjoy their free chips salsa and perhaps try their ice cold margarita A few friends from college and I came here for dinner because we couldn t settle on a restaurant in Morningside Heights or any other restaurant in the vincinity Although the atmosphere was nice and the margarita looked good I didn t try one the food here is simply average The chicken burrito that I ordered tasted bland and so was the beef burrito that my friend got and seriously I did not feel like I was eating in a Mexican restaurant However I definitely enjoyed their unlimited you can always ask for refills chips salsa but these fill you up pretty quickly I thought the service was pretty decent The waiters are always getting us water and refilling our chips Okay place if you just want to talk get some drinks and snack on something which you can do at home as well while catching up with friends 
0_xQH_zT364wYJr-XRluWw Columbia There s nothing bad to say about this place I went here on a Tuesday night It s a small restaurant front so it s easy to miss Once inside the restaurant is about the size of a shoe box By 8pm there wasn t a table that was empty and yet we still felt like we had plenty of space to enjoy each others company without feeling rushed The place is essentially run by one guy who is the host waiter and bus boy The kitchen is well non existent I saw one guy in the back throwing appetizers and main courses into an over sized toaster oven But don t let that scare you away because the quality of the food is not compromised at all this way Some other high points is that it s BYO with no corkage fee That s tough to come by in the city Although I have to mention you get plastic wine glasses at this place but to be honest who cares If you go between 6 8 you get an appetizer and main course for 20 Considering that their duck main course is 20 alone this makes for a great deal for those on a budget I d definitely go back for some more toaster oven goodness 
0_ziEfyEGNSgHIBUgurnBA Columbia Honestly Ollie s is pretty good chinese food If you re in the neighborhood and craving chinese just do it All you hataz it s chinese food don t expect a big production It s salty saucy and sometimes greasy just eat it 
1-IBKvePBi8I5Yaw8AnnJg Columbia Cheap fast and pretty good is exactly what this place is I went about 4 months ago and haven t been back however I would go if it were convenient I really did love their chips which was a sweet potato fry type food It is worth trying but not something I will go out of my way for 
1-iNhZ0gVUKquHKqjIRA0A Columbia Great prices amazing food Careful with the lasagna as it weighs about 5 pounds but it s SO good As are all the other dishes hearty is definitely the word for this spot 
1-KzpFxU2K6hhDwAPuS0Gg Columbia This is a cool after work spot The drinks are reasonable and the food is great The place is pretty small so get there early so you can get a seat The music is always pumping They play a mixture of Hip Hop R B and old school The crowd is cool and the bartenders are helpful and friendly 
10BsdKHLeUSXjN-UORjoqQ Columbia HOLY F CHICKEN F GYRO OK so I work nearby on broadway and was looking for something different to eat that wouldn t break my pockets I saw this place on yelp and I always walk past on my way to the 1 train so I thought I d try it FRIGGGGGIN AWESOME HANDS DOWN best gyro I ve EVER eaten taste fresh from the chicken to the veggies to the bread I should buy my Boyfriend one for dinner as this one will last me through lunch and dinner this is just tooo amazing I will definitely be going back on a regular basis 
10bUMV6Zp2eUPTQQeLQBhg Columbia I wish there were more late night places like this in Boston What can I say It s Indian in a burrito a burrito Make sure you get the hot sauce but be careful because it s pretty spicy Therefore if you don t love spicy foods then ask for it on the side 
10_ue8r3eSfjL-rrFN7CYg Columbia A few other graduate students and I ordered from this place to help fuel our end of the semester celebration We were amazed that they would deliver until 12 on a weeknight and we had a strong craving for Mexican food We also heard that they deliver margaritas in hilarious Chinese restaurant soup containers which was an added plus We ordered delivery which was a mistake Ridiculously crappy service and the fact that it was only a mediocre value kill this place for me The menu has a large variety of options but in my opinion prices were jacked about a dollar or two higher than what was fair and this takes a toll on the poor graduate student s budget Even though we made sure to repeat our order three times and have it repeated back to us to ensure it was understood they still mixed up two of my friend s orders and if one were a vegetarian it could have been the difference between dinner and no dinner Also they tacked on a mysterious delivery charge that caused my 10 Nachos to spike up to 16 when all was said and done and the delivery charge was split between 3 people There was absolutely nothing special about the food The best part about my meal was a wedge of avocado my friend had on the side of her burrito that she gave to me so I probably could have walked to Appletree Market bought an avocado and saved myself 12 I will likely never order from this place ever again and I d only halfheartedly recommend it if it s late at night you re desperate for takeout and nothing else is open 
11ljGnDIQtK87-vSfgHDdQ Columbia Hmm with so many good brunch places in the area I hardly think KU is worthy of the hoards of people it attracts I ordered the woodstock pancakes and they were good but a bit dry My friend s dish some sort of egg item was also pretty average Sadly overpriced and overhyped 
11XVh_L411bku81z0rSBcg Columbia Love this place feels like Italy a happy homey atmosphere great food at a good price The lamb chops are the BEST 
12GDPqkc9CXKE6cFE5qIvA Columbia Toast and I have a history You see there was a time when I thought I could handle Lex s Long Island Iced Tea Challenge The challenge was hard fought but somewhere amidst the 4th pint of well spirits and soda something happened Something blurry and dizzy And then I woke up on the floor of the bathroom at 5am with 26 text messages and an angry Lex knocking at the door I was arrested on Halloween just outside the front doors of the establishment I have dated women I ve met there bonded with friends and even met one of my closest cohorts at the restaurant Good times aside Toast isn t anything particularly special in and of itself For the Manhattan School of Music alum however its appeal can t be denied As the best local watering hole near the campus Toast has served students well in their after school revelry for years Judged purely as a restaurant and bar Toast comes out just above average The seating is uncomfortable and there is never enough room the bar is too small and the atmosphere is well forgettable That aside it is indeed homely They make a mean burger even if the fries suck They have great beers on tap and the prices are just right So my advice to you Don t go out of your way to visit Toast but if you live in the area or happen to be an MSM student drink up and enjoy 
-IooZ_UmGQ8Sqdt0HS0WwQ Harvard I never really feel like I m going into battle when I come here with a lot of people I ve had spontaneous cast parties here and last time I was here with 6 people from work Even though we got a smaller table than desired we were never really considered a burden which sometimes happen when you roll up to a place with more than 4 people I think John Harvard s is always good for groups minus Monday night trivia heh The food is definitely hit or miss Sometimes they try and go over the top with sandwiches by making them HUGE Salads are great but get the dressing on the side to avoid soggy leaves and an overdose of creaminess I m not crazy about the regular beers but sometimes I ll get one of their features And they have growlers for those interested in taking home their favorite beer from this brew house Like I kind of mentioned up top the service is really great Most if not all the waiters I ve had have been pretty entertaining and definitely chill I just wish the food was just as consistent 
-isyh-P9FzMxH6jFvrn1eA Harvard Hi Everybody I wanted to tell you about OM from two perspectives I had a great meal there individually AND then since I had to plan a dinner for conference attendees for work I decided to try OM for our group It was amazing Everyone loved it The food was superb and the servers were just as gracious and charming and attentive and pleasant and sweet as you could possibly imagine I have only had really great friendly experiences here I want to recommend it to anyone who wants a lovely meal in a great setting and I want to recommend it to any of you corporate types who want to hold group dinners or functions here My group has held our event dinners all over harvard square and this was by far the most popular with guest and staff alike Try it you will love it Cheers everybody Amanda 
-iUdunaqmbyPOQolBfLI1w Harvard Well this would have been a solid 3 star review until we saw a mouse In the restaurant We were there on Friday Aug 28 and at about 10pm when we were getting ready to leave we all saw a mouse scurry across the back wall of the main dining room The waitress saw the mouse as well and was not at all disturbed which to us WAS disturbing I know that Boston buildings have mouse problems But I don t think it s unreasonable to expect eating establishments to deal with those issues It s one thing to have a mouse in your apartment it s another to have a mouse in an area where you are making food for many many people As for the food it was pretty solidly a 3 star experience Worrying about leptospirosis has downgraded our rating 
-iV0_f37Qqc0qo6MGVqlKg Harvard I am a fan of Cambridge 1 I used to eat here frequently when I was going to school in Cambridge They have very good thin crust pizza with lots of toppings The pizza itself is not greasy and is actually very healthy I especially like the crsipy crust around the edge of the pie I also like the Iceberg Lettece Wedge this dish may not be for everyone but I like it because it is simple and refreshing The price is relatively inexpensive and the ambience is trendy I ve been to many different pizza joints and Cambridge 1 is one of my favorites 
-Iwr5z3fNa2WqeTvRUK2ow Harvard It s been called to my attention that I did not write in my review that we tried to get anyone s attention but I will mention that we did indeed try to flag someone down We attempted many times to verbally get someone s attention as well as physically hand waving etc So having been ignored we left It has also been mentioned to me that it is a seat yourself place a sign might be nice to place you know somewhere Since there is no sign it would have been helpful for someone anyone to have said Hey it s seat yourself so wherever you can find a place It literally would have taken 5 seconds to do so Since it was incredibly busy and we were a relatively large group it s a small bar the tables aren t huge we would have left but definitely would have come back to try again on another day 
-ixYcmm4bLmqZek8XvakEA Harvard I hadn t been to Casablanca in years but recently purchased a Buy With Me discount deal Went for a date night We arrived earlier than our reservation and our table was ready That was a big plus The wait staff was friendly and attentive and of course you have to love the decor I did find it a little weird though that their was no music playing in the dining area This was at about 6 30 at night on a Saturday night I ordered the Sangria and my date had a beer The Sangria was very good We didn t order appetizers as the bread basket and olive oil was sufficient but other tables had apps that looked very good For our main course we had the Pork Chop with Ricotta Dumplings in a balsamic reduction and the Quail on Turnip Mash The Pork Chop was decent nothing to write home about The Turnip Mash however was out of this world I could just eat that All and all the food was excellent but not mind blowing I really should give Casablanca 4 stars as it is very deserving but in comparison to its neighboring restaurants like the Harvest it does not shadow its competitors But definitely good for a date night to impress 
-IzEXa0lK-OkVLDqROiA7Q Harvard I really think that if you live in or around Boston you have to hit up Miracle of Science at least once I freaking adore the enormous Periodic Table menu they have conveniently located on a chalkboard wall The atmosphere is really casual the service is good the crowd is laid back the drink selection and price is reasonable and the food is solid There s no reason to NOT eat here at least once 
-J8LN7nFShUIv3poNrLP0Q Harvard In Annie s House we are always in a battle between Cinderella s or Chicago Pizza when it comes down to pizza delivery or so we thought One few days ago in a little house in East Cambridge we researched high and low for a pizza place that would deliver a fresh mozzarella tomato pie a plain mushroom pie two gingerale s and something very artery clogging for the hungover patient oh and maybe a greek salad too FatS O S Every place had this or that but never the whole combo we were looking for so how great was it when we came across Beauty s a place we ve both eyed many times They had everything the ordering process over phone was smooth and plus they came in lightning speed The still warm and bubbled crust Margherita Francesca even came with a little container with basil Awwwwww how unpredictable The Americana style mushroom pizza was thin and perfect packaged in an almost stylish as far as pizza boxes go cardboard with their personal stickers everywhere Everything was tasty Yummy cheese good quality garlic bread not some mince garlic and slab of butter italian roll Trust me order delivery from here if you are in Cambridge since Pinnochio s and best slice blah blah places would need a pickup What a beauty except the name of the place Beauty for pizza subs and salads and the font color used for the sign Sorry people but typo snob in me wouldn t let those details pass right on by without mention 
-jbLwAXFDmam7SFDD81IIA Harvard Meatball subs are deeelicious The bread is the best part 
-JJEJ1z9EmeDhL6KGh-kHg Harvard Boston has several solid even great pizza joint but very few decent by the slice options Heat lamps warming slowly congealing stale cardboard spinning limply in their glass box is enough to put you off eating all together Which is why Pinocchio s is great the good pizza good location good price means new pies are coming out constantly and your chance of getting something fresh and hot are excellent One of the few places to eat a decent quick lunch on the cheap in Harvard Sq now if they d just bring back the breakfast places 
-jO62aBGXUs67NH7a0a7BQ Harvard Wow what a let down The menu looked amazing yet almost every dish successfully disappointed Service was good although it wasn t clear how familiar our waiter actually was with the menu When asked the difference between the maple beer and their house beer he said that one had a maple finish and the other didn t very helpful Their house beer with pig in the title tastes like a bad homebrew Definitely stick with familiars like the IPA We asked for his recommendation between two dishes pork chop and lamb and he said that he didn t really like either again between another set of choices he couldn t enthusiastically endorse one over the other I m all for honesty but this was a bit much The appetizer a salmon salami was great Really delicate and nice flavors A highlight of the meal The crab cakes were tasty although we both found pieces of shell all throughout them ick My entree the duck was overcooked think dry thanksgiving turkey I sent it back and explained that I would like it a bit more rare The returning dish was practically still quacking it was so raw Again it went back to the kitchen As they have an open kitchen I was able to see the chef line cooks arguing with our waiter about the done ness of things The third attempt was cooked appropriately and was nice Food came out quickly almost too fast in fact We barely had time to finish up our appetizers before they were whisked away and entrees were before us I appreciate prompt service but this was altogether rushed We asked to see the manager who came over and apologetically let us knew he d been informed of the duck situation We also let him know about the shells in the crabcakes He comped the duck and also brought us out a few nice cheeses for dessert I really appreciated the way that the mgmt dealt with things and attempted to make it all better All in Henrietta s was not what we had hoped for 
-jOmP6MUeirI9O_eM7bkDg Harvard I was lucky enough to get to go to the soft opening I d heard they were having I was prepared to cut them some slack since I figured they d need to get their routine down but no slack needed cutting They were totally on the ball The service was perfect and extremely friendly and the food was outstanding The place has a cool diner vibe but more airy and open You ve got a lot to choose from on the menu and I m pretty sure they serve breakfast all day Thank you They have a build your own burger with a ton of different topping options The hard thing is deciding What I really appreciate is the fact that they make most of their ingredients in house things such as their seitan their applesauce and their vegan mayonnaise It s not store bought stuff The desserts were even more incredible We got peach pie which I don t even want to think about because it just makes me want some right now It was made with fresh peaches and the crust was so light and flaky yet crispy ok must stop thinking about it until I can go there again And the vegan blueberry cheesecake unbelievable Why didn t I get any to take home why why why I will learn from this mistake Anyhow I can t wait to go back and try everything on their menu most of which can be made vegan we were told So psyched about this place 
-Jt8F2A0XyQmGuPjuFpIDw Harvard I have a co worker who describes Characters as a the bastard child of a mall food court and an airport bar I personally find this description both adept and hilarious and as you walk into Characters oddly open Chilis in a hotel vibe you might too It s a dive without meaning to be and without being dirty The drinks are fine and the food is fine I had a quesadilla which was completely unoffensive for instance Their weekly Stump Trivia is actually pretty fun because amidst your desolate surroundings you can kick some butt and still brag that you did it a stone s throw away from the intellectual assets of MIT Don t go for dinner don t go on a date and don t go as a destination but dare I say it DO go for plenty of space with good humored friends who want to make their hour a bit happier or your trivia team that s been down on its luck Because mall bar airport food court adds enough character to at least make things interesting 
-jtBlcFKRtdHthURXB7P5w Harvard I can t believe it took me years after living in the area to start eating here I guess I thought it was just dessert and coffee However I d say this is THE place for sandwiches in Harvard Square I ve had their tea coffee hot chocolate quiche baked goods and their famous sweet potato sandwich Oh my God that sandwich As a regular carnivore it s pretty hard to get me to order a sandwich without meat on it But this sandwich is unbelievable Hard to get a seat sometimes because of all the people chilling and studying so I don t recommend coming with more than 2 3 people But I love the atmosphere Honestly love everything about this place I m going to make an effort to visit more often 
-Jtz241EOfDWCvdxR9HLjA Harvard good burger fun place but never seen a busier place same with their other two locations tried to come at 7 and couldnt get a table had to come back after 10 Tried to bring my fiancee here twice and cant get a table always an hour wait 
-jvlMV_f7eNdu8cWOjCRTw Harvard Awesome coffees They taste like hot silk I d love to stay around here all day and indulge in their drinks and pastries but the lack of wi fi is disappointing 
-K-ek3HF1sq7Dy6upeK_bA Harvard I love a good diner menu and quirky places so The Friendly Toast is right up my alley I went on a weekday lunch and the restaurant was packed with people from the local business parks Cambridge Center MIT Labs etc I was on my own so I took a seat at the bar Menu is classic diner with a twist like pancakes and french toast all day but with M Ms in the pancakes if you so choose I had an odd sounding combo balsamic scramble with cayenne pecans and spinach and although I would have never put those things together on my own they were in fact fantastic The homefries accompanying them were passable which is about all you can say of most homefries I have tried in Boston at least these weren t mealy like ones I have had elsewehere Plenty of vegetarian options on the menu was a plus though the sheer number of things with American cheese on them disappointed me Some people may think the decor is either overwhleming obnoxious or just trying to hard in a vaguely punk retro hipster way but I liked the bar covered in decals and edged with mah jong tiles And I am almost certain I heard The Dead Milkmen playing over the stereo so that alone makes me happy I will definitely be back both for the food and for the atmosphere 
-k19zneZa9I4z6vVZNv7gA Harvard Love it One of the best restaurant in Harvard Square High quality food good ambiance though with premium price 
-k7U-wIR3ppx58Eedq2leQ Harvard This is an institution ripe for replacement It s been around so long the sense of entitlement is bred into it The burgers aren t anything to write home about the tables are cramped the serving staff are variable I rocked up there at 5 minutes to 9pm it always shuts at 9 always and the they refused to do a take out shake for me Seriously Shutting early One thing saves it from a lower score the shakes are pretty damn phenomenal But even still it d take a lot to bring me to go back here give the attitude that pervades the place 
-kadAc78rf75SRKRUJeg8Q Harvard Lunch buffet Too expensive 7 95 Too freakin spicy and I like spice I could not taste a thing 
-KcbWzzvKOdyT-5_f_MdLw Harvard Decent pies by far not the greatest but for 9 we got a 6 slice with cheese and it came out real quick Then again we were kinda drunk and hadn t eaten in 8 hours so it s not like we were picky plus it was pouring rain outside and needed a place to chill for a bit 
-KcsRc4UR5aT8CkfkgIo4A Harvard The last review was from early December and maybe this place has improved the kimchi broth was excellent very homemade ish I make kimchi soup often and the tom kha was ok too much lemongrass The quality of all the vegetables especially the mushrooms was excellent as was the beef and pork My friend had the yaki soba which she devoured I ate everything except for the greens which I didn t like The service was fine although our waiter needed to raise the volume a bit On a cold day like today I was perfectly happy to boil my mouth and fingers with some hot cabbage broth Now I want to go to Shabu Ya 
-kHpvFIUIV_45m4d0Sw75g Harvard I stopped in for some dessert tonight with a friend and we had a lovely time Our desserts were delicious but what really sealed the deal was the wonderful service we got from our server Carolyn She was so friendly attentive knowledgable and an absolute delight I would definitely return to this location we left with our hearts as warm as the molten chocolate inside my friend s cake 
-KJPx5Ylen7vD417hXiJRg Harvard I walked past this place nearly every day for two years and somehow never managed to notice it What the So we re wandering around the Square after seeing Salt at the AMC and get a sudden urge for sushi I think crap Shabu Ya is my only option no offense Shabu Ya but you do shabu better than sushi then decide to quickly Yelp it Lo An actual sushi place Sold The sushi itself maki actually can t remember the names but we got three different ones was nothing to write home about but it was super fresh at least and I enjoyed my green tea I think I should ve chosen my rolls better which I will do next time I m in Harvard Square and in need of some sushi Also is this place really BYO They 
-kMl9mda-o0bOpRM66N0GA Harvard Good place for cheap fast ethnic food They serve meat and veggies and decent falafel Not much place to sit more of a take away fast food joint reminiscent of Maos in Barcelona They re open til 3 am on the weekends so perfect for post boozing munchies There s a minimum for credit cards 
-KOMTvCGGJQ1DGRd-S3cpg Harvard This place is small and best suited for take out only but oohhhh the food is so worth it I had a lamb roll up and it was to DIE FOR The prices are reasonable too They only take cash but don t worry there are about 10 ATMs around the corner to choose from Definitely recommended for a late night snack after a night of drinking 
-KOzZqge0avDKTOjJllaeQ Harvard Shortly after I joined Groupon one popped up for Think Tank so I went for it I finally got around to going there with my girlfriend last week on date night and it was fairly disappointing First off we went in at 7pm on Friday night and it was maybe half full This was not the most auspicious sign for a place in Kendall Sq but not a dealbreaker The decor was somewhat spare although they did have a working photobooth at least it was working until two young girls took too much advantage of it The music was 70 s 80 s lounge which was a plus although it was also much too loud We each ordered beers which were reasonably priced at 5 50 on draft For an appetizer we got the crispy pork belly It was tasty and a little bit crispy but I think I was expecting a little more wow from it the gf loved it though For main course I ordered the Seoul burger and gf ordered the Ramen The Seoul burger seems to be their signature dish but it didn t blow me away I ordered it medium but there wasn t even a hint of pink inside The egg is a great touch the bun is tasty and the horseradish aioli was nice The meat wasn t anything to write home about and all in all I d say it was a decent burger but maybe not a 10 burger Plus the sweet potato fries were quite limp The ramen was alright but again not that impressive If you re going to put what is typically college survival food on the menu you should give it some pizzazz and the roasted root vegetables tried to but didn t succeed For dessert we were excited about the State Fair dessert cotton candy caramel apple and funnel cake but the cotton candy machine was broken Disheartened and overall disappointed in an over priced but average ly tasting meal we gave up Service was good our waitress was highly attentive perhaps overly so at times I thought she was going to plop down and join us but I think part of this was due to the lack of busy ness in the restaurant Overall if I lived down the street from Think Tank I might go occasionally for a drink but the food isn t good enough to merit the prices and the trek there 
-kpwgWc9W70r3aX-Jnd-Rw Harvard Based on the mostly good reviews on here I decided to try this new spot for lunch today Before I could even finish my lunch I was compelled to post about what is possibly the WORST chicken parm sub I have ever had Actually up the street at ABC Pizza they make theirs with processed nugget style chicken so they might win that one Seriously these chicken cutlets are so dry and tough I can only imagine that they ve been sitting out for a very long time days maybe and then reheated In fact I almost want to laugh at them for actually trying to pass these leathery chicken artifacts off as food Mediocre bread sauce and cheese round out this disappointing trashworthy lunch And by trashworthy I mean I literally threw 60 of it in the trash 
-KqhcmoKIheAMeDXeNG-lA Harvard Holy Sweet Jesus I worship at the cheesey foot of the Nokes My coworker Matty B and I used to order a full size Nokes pizza every Sunday afternoon and we would waste no time in inhaling the entirety of it s seductive cheesey and meaty goodness Nokes pizza is thick extravagant and not incredibly greasy It will make you weep out of sheer joy 
-kr660OxPpF4MvVUnesdsQ Harvard This brand new counter service eatery is definitely worth stopping by Delicious food made with attention will cost you a bit less than it should The people at the restaurant were really nice and appreciative of our business However you should probably make sure you ve got a few minutes to kill it took them about 15 minutes to prep our lunch with no other customers inside They feature a bunch of lavash ish wraps in typical middle eastern style falafel shwarma hummus etc with lettuce tomato pickle and tahini The wraps are dirt cheap under 5 right now for a vegetarian option and 5 7 for meat The wraps are also delicious and they will even serve them to you out of the wrap and plated if you ask nicely There are some other plated options mostly configurations of the above items which we ll have to go back to try These are a bit more expensive but are still less than 10 The reason the wraps were so tasty was because the food was clearly cooked to order a mixed bag at a place with counter service You expect the food to come out quick so when you re sitting waiting and listening to the falafel fry in the kitchen it can be a little discouraging However it was totally worth the wait I think this also might be due to the fact that this place is new I bet they ll iron out some kinks and maybe raise the prices once things start moving along It s a nicely decorated restaurant with pop middle eastern music playing at a reasonable volume The dude behind the counter went above and beyond in terms of taking care of us although we ordered at the counter we basically got table service to the point where we decided to leave a tip If everybody has as nice a time as we did Viva will do just fine 
-KRjMAqpvjgVuJ9syyMqhQ Harvard After seeing all the reviews and raves from friends this place was just a setup for bitter disappointment however I love it when my cynicism proves to be wrong Atmosphere Sat evening got there 30 mins early to get drinks as expected no hope of getting seated earlier Bar is TINY the restaurant is tucked away behind minimalist decor but cozy Part of cozy though are tight spaces just to warn you We were seated only 5 mins after our reservation Sound level perfect for conversation This place is great for date or small groups Friend had requested a specific table setup before we had arrived and it was nicely accommodated Service Spot on friendly and helpful bartender and waiters Drinks I drove so mocktails for me only 65 a good ginger beer not much taste of the grenadine or cucumber though 44 Minty lemony goodness loved it No complaints from friend about beer and bourbon selections Food Yes the two of us ate all of this we know how to throw it down Plus the portion sizes are just right that somehow I didn t feel ill afterwards Bread Average Corn Bread w Sorghum Butter Crispy w a slightly syrup soaked texture in a good way very dessert like and small so it was befitting as an appetizer sorghum butter has a great finish Deviled Eggs Had the approval of native Virginian friend who is a prolific deviled egg eater Uh how can anything topped with crisp bacon be bad Nuff said Seafood Charcuterie Excellent scallops good amt of acid shrimp a tad overcooked white fish salad on crostini was decent tasted like food reminiscent from a Jewish meal Pork late This is the reason why I could never do Kosher Very sweet but yummy rib and a bomb ass pork belly most of the bomb ass ness attributed to the crisp skin the fatty part could have been better if slightly firmer but whatever I could have eaten a plate of that stuff regardless Shrimp and Grits Creamy but slightly overcooked I would say not as good as purported but tasty Cornmeal Catfish Perfectly crisp outside w o being greasy moist on inside Dirty rice yummy and light Roasted Pear Bourbon Ice Cream Cake Uh ice cream cake yes please Not a huge fan of the pears but they were not overwhelming and overall still a winner Peach Tart w Tarragon Ice Cream Warm gooey inside crisp top Wished the peach were sweeter but friend liked it just the way it was Tarragon ice cream was surprisingly pleasant and refreshing would definitely buy a tub if they made it At end of meal they gave us little tiny bites of chocolate w peanuts and oats a pleasing last bite Overall Food 4 stars but bump up to 5 for really lovely staff service and overall dining experience Will def be back for their 10PM menu that they have on Fri and Sat nights 
-ktIWStweLJ-W7QmYln3kg Harvard Oooh Korean Wings Sounds tasty In fact they are pretty good But there are some pretty big problems from being top drawer First I love me some spicy wings but there s gotta be something to calm yourself down No ranch or anything yes I realize this is a Korean restaurant However I m sure there must be some Korean equivalent I guess there was some cole slaw or what I think is actually kimchi but it didn t do that great of a job And of course the pickles LOL I m chuckling as I write this Its almost preposterous as to how this restaurant could serve this piece of shit Literally though it smelled like crap No I m not insane because as we took the leftovers home a lady on the bus noted how it smelled like death There isn t even a fictional smell from a Harry Potter potion that could rival how crappy this thing smelled I m glad no one realized the smell was coming from our Bon Chon bag otherwise we might have gotten kicked off the bus Stay away from the pickles otherwise the other things are pretty good 
-kygInYXIjYmFFiH4UaJrw Harvard This place is jumpin but the coffee isn t amazing and it s hard to find a seat sometimes The dessert food pastries and whatnot are really tasty though 
-L2NF7I2kd3oBLi3DhJIDA Harvard Lord or Hobo Last night I went with friends to Lord Hobo aka the resting place of B Side Lounge and we were all very confused for what they are trying to go for On the one hand the lights are bright gone are the cozy booths of B side to be replaced with uncomfortable high top tables and backless stools and a bunch of flat screen tv s playing sports Ok so looking around you think this is a dive sports bar Then the menu comes with admittedly creative but expensive entr es starting at 20 What the what If I want to spend 20 an entr e I want an atmosphere to match like Oleana or Dante but with dive sports bar atmosphere I need a huge plate of nachos for 6 and 3 drafts What Lord Hobo has is a major identity crisis Maybe that s what the weird name is all about Lord prices with a hobo atmosphere Not sure who they are trying to appeal to The crowd seemed to be inherited b side hipsters not the frat boys who might be into watching sports on the flat screen tv s Well good luck lord hobo and working out your identity issues I won t be back The whole experience just made miss B side more tear Peace out girl scouts 
-lDxXHNUNrwWUFnvnL_WSQ Harvard I read the reviews out of curiosity and then remembered it has been waaay too long since my last visit to Cuchi Cuchi Walk in and be instantly charmed by the art deco glam craziness oh and the excellent food and drinks The tuna tartar avocado mousse cornets are mind blowing It is a bit expensive but the more people in your group the better to sample all the dishes I came here one night with about 10 people and I think we got one of everything off the menu and it was all great The brie en croute is the stuff dreams are made of 
-LmfVI9lc0Vm3vCVfnNpDw Harvard last week i hit up the middle east to watch a friend play a show good venue decent bar and ample room can t complain i ve seen numerous shows and have always had a good time there my gf also does belly dance shows there so i gotta show them some love 
-lN9xJo7fBJO1Bp9pOzdUw Harvard My FAVE I will always find an excuse to go to this place Delicious and affordable And unlimited chips and salsa while you look through the menu The shrimp and crawfish quesadilla is highly recommended It s just under 9 but i ALWAYS have leftovers The only bad thing about this place is that it can get super crowded but usually only on friday and saturday nights 
-LopP23CSYbJ_JogN94Qzg Harvard Totally don t understand the hate for this place Four friends and I headed here for Restaurant Week and it was fan freaking tastic All five of us got the all fondue version of the three course meal and I was really impressed The Swiss cheese fondue appetizer was perfectly executed gooey cheese not too salty with an interesting assortment of things to dip in the cheese The highlight for me was their potato wedges really crispy and perfectly balanced against the cheese The main course was probably the weakest of the three but seriously it s chunks of meat that you cook in delicious broth and then dip into things still a pretty high baseline of awesomeness The beef and shrimp were both very high quality meat and the broth we got the French broth which has mushrooms and beef stock and some other spicing that the vegetable broth doesn t was excellent My only complaint was with the sauces which were a little boring Dessert was knee weakening Conversation which had been lively and animated until that point stopped dead in its tracks when that chocolate concoction appeared I ve never seen a group of people tear through a spread of food as quickly as we did The chocolate was perfect and the assortment of things to put in the chocolate including chocolate brownies which created a level of chocolate y ness that I m sure is illegal in most states was great With a nice bottle of the house white which our server recommended and which was really quite good and not at all expensive though if you want to spend some money on a bottle of red boy have you come to the right place this was an outstanding dinner Service was a little slow but that s probably because the place was packed to the gills and it actually worked out well because I ate an entire meal s worth of cheese as an appetizer and needed the extra time to make room for dessert I d definitely come back for another Restaurant Week and I m curious enough about the standard menu that I might come back later this fall 
-lQBgXG6qrd7Bt6pL2OUKg Harvard I ll review the Pheonix for it s lunchtime cuisine I hit this place up during the week on my lunch break The waitresses almost always change and there is almost always the guy having bud for lunch sitting at the bar The burgers buff chicken sand steak and cheese and nachos are all pretty good They also serve smithwicks which you can t find many places get it with a guinness head just sounds cool The place has totally different dive feel during the day compared to the night Why wait in line at the Miracle when you can go to the Pheonix 
-lS6WGMH6UCefN3yzHlrQg Harvard The warm beet salad with goat cheese was delicious and much larger than expected The steak was a little salty as were the frites but sometimes salty is delicious While the cocktails may be on the expensive side our vodka sodas were large and strong Service Not bad but not particularly good either 
-lYsnL0C_K6AZguFQbxv8Q Harvard Wooo this was such a convenient place to eat It s right in Harvard square I went in early Sat morning and classes just started for the undergrads so that may be why it was somewhat empty Can t speak for how it gets later in the year I had an omelette which comes with home fries and toast 8 They had some fancy stuffed french toast for their specials too but I was in a more savory mood Omelettes were not fancy or anything standard not ridiculously stuffed but I enjoyed it Service was chill and they were very nice Place is a strip of booth chairs so come with a small crowd or avoid a crowd altogether If this place was hard to get to I wouldn t necessarily come back but I like that it s relativel cheap and in harvard square with decent food that fulfills my breakfast needs 
-lzMrX4AX0XUo0WF-AM-NA Harvard Ick Just ick I wasn t expecting anything great and I m pretty forgiving as far as cheap food goes not a picky eater at all But this was far far beyond what even I could stomache It was greasy to the point of being oily and tasted like sweet rancid chicken broth Judging from the other reviews I m guessing this place has some okay or even good dishes and some really horrible ones I ordered pad thai I m too blind to read the descriptions on the menu ahead of time and went with the first thing I recognized But even if their other dishes are gourmet quality they only get a single star from me if you can t cook something well don t put it on your menu 
-L_epZY2ChD9xsIfbbd4tQ Harvard Great green gooey lord they have the garlic sauce that I have missed ever since Ararat in Watertown closed down a couple years ago ASK FOR IT It can probably make anything taste better ice cream croque en bouche mandoo navratan korma baklava Hamburger Helper you name it I bet that garlic sauce improves the taste You could spread it on your arm and try to absorb the nutrition through your skin The guy who runs the place is so nice that I don t want to think about the kinda dried out chicken shawarma You know what I don t care They have friggin amazing garlic sauce They could serve shoe leather sandwiches but I d probably not notice the garlic sauce is that good 
-M1HHBL_e5nluhfxrupcvA Harvard Great beer list Had appetizers of vegetarian chili nachos yum calamari too small a portion but YUM and the crab cake salad for dinner Then I saw the mice Same night as the other reviewer apparently running around and across the dining room as the sun went down Mentioned to the waitress and she said Oh where Told her ummmmm right there me pointing and she said she d take care of it Really dude 
-M1rgYnaoGC82VEta1gdsg Harvard average tasting above average healthy pizza for astronomical prices but they let you pre order online which is very cool especially for busy families the margherita pizza is very disappointing and plain despite the fresh basil leaves pepperoni lover s pizza is fine though the amount of toppings is quite sparse It all tastes fine and being able to order whole wheat crust earns the bonus star to 3 because the prices are just too high THEY DON T ACCEPT DISCOVER CARD 
-m3rQwS1ncMouMiV9u-leQ Harvard Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh THAT s what a falafel wrap is supposed to taste like 
-m5n0PZVgrhSAaQUgTBzng Harvard Fancy place The food was very good but only small portions Also very pricy What was interesting during the evening three of us got a Toronto and its taste alcohol content and the amount served vast differed in each case I was lucky and got the most alcohol and also the largest amount this was good Also tried the two other drink and at least one was not good We talked to them about it but it was not properly fixed They did not offer to replace the drink 
-m73irTk1N5IQCcUdFTreQ Harvard The only good thing about this place was the waitress She was sweet and attentive though not mind blowingingly good I can t believe how crappy the rest of the experience was My friends and I had reservations for days and were really looking forward to it But then we are being walked past dirty empty tables and were brought to a booth shoved in the corner of the back exit with no light and a sticky table I kindly asked for a new table and was initially told no but then I asked again and said we d be willing to wait The host went and got another hostess who walked back and said we could but we d have to wait 30 minutes despite that fac that were were only a few people in line and SO many tables just dirty and waiting to be bussed So we got stuck sitting in the darkest corner booth imaginable by an area where they store stuff just terrible And the food was awful Our vegetables weren t cooked because they didn t steam them at all so thanks for the luke warm pasta and hard broccoli really worth the money Just not worth the time seriously 
-mAZVO-oRhYx2KPD5CnTrw Harvard Harvard Square seriously lacks in cheap brunch places and I was ecstatic when I discovered this place Extremely reliable for a very QUICK sit down breakfast Never a line on the weekdays From start to finish breakfast will take you 45 minutes tops so it s a great place to come before class I usually get the hash eggs with coffee and it comes to 11 with tax and tip I ve also ordered the cheese blintzes as well as the California benedict instead of ham there s avocado both of which are delicious They also have a large selection of very inventive omelettes although I m not a big fan of eggs so I ve never tried them Their portions are large and you d have to be very hungry to finish it all They also keep the coffee cup full Awesome The only reason I ve docked them one star is because their food isn t out of this world by any means Just some good filling brunch that doesn t leave me feeling like I m about to have a heart attack Love the ambiance too Colorful large booths and very spacious retro atmosphere Lots of window seating rare in Boston with natural light I also love how you can sit there sipping coffee long after you ve paid the bill without feeling any pressure from the staff to leave I ll definitely keep coming as a regular 
-Mc2_Avfu7Rc-kXNotC4sA Harvard Great burgers and fries Haven t tried the shakes yet The workers could be smarter The last one messed up my order a bit but they are still nice I like this place more than the nearby mr Bartley s It Is cheaper and good qualit Definitely go if you re in the square 
-mL39ncSTNSrwOPxSeICIQ Harvard I love their burritos I never liked burritos until I came here 
-MlkSMtKgl5F_BnsKpo1lg Harvard Chill laid back atmosphere perfect for a lazy afternoon lunch or dinner I came with 5 others just after the Sunday lunch rush A waiter came up to us and said the big table was about to free up but we could grab drinks at the bar while waiting We sat at the right angle high table and ordered off the periodic table menu of burgers and satays The waiters even have nerdy shorthand to take orders The mimosas are served in regular pint glasses and decently priced considering how much you re getting to get pleasantly buzzed during the day My Ronie burger was stuffed with jalapenos and spicy The fries are really pan fried potato wedges so they might be healthier for you than regular french fries Service was ok Our server was nice and helpful I definitely could ve used a water refill early into my jalapeno burger Nice views of Mass Ave where you can people watch and observe men unicycling down the street 
-MMXfT2o9_yoV4QDG0wyAg Harvard yes Yes YES This place is A mazing and lives up to all the hype that has been generated This place serves southern food that is exhaulted beyond comfort food in fact it ranks up there with last meal status The place is adorable small but larger than you originally think and rather cozy The parking is a bit of a pain but thankfully there is cinema parking right around the corner and they validate woot woot The drink list was short and sweet and so interesting that I couldn t make up my mind on what I wanted to try first They went over my head with the hippest retro ist of liquors so I picked something that sounded delicious that happened to have grapefruit in it I forget the number and can t pull up the menu for some reason but it was good enough that I didn t stray from that cocktail the rest of the evening it was strong yet refreshing and very delicious As it was a group of 6 of us we were able to do some serious carnage on the menu The appitizers we mowed down included the salad the cornbread the clams casino the Grits and the pork confit They were all inhaled and claimed delicious by the table But seriously if you must know the cornbread and grits are a carb lover s dream or nightmare depending on said carb lover s diet situation at the time For our meals again we easily devored more than half the menu with the standouts being the trout w califlower and browned butter melt in my mouth tender with a nutty unctious flavor explosion from the browned butter sauce and the Catfish crispy skin delicious flavors Not to say that the steak chicken and dumplings i e gnocchi and the pork and beans weren t delicious they were We were too full to have an actual solid dessert but managed to force down yet another round of cocktails Service was great my every need was met and I left fully of delicious food and booze 
-MnQ-A0kJ5syzTtb5qTFOw Harvard 3 5 Stars Great New England cuisine They pride themselves on local farmed ingredients and the freshness definitely plays out The food here definitely has a lot of flavors The service was also good Definitely come here Sunday to Thursday for the discounted 3 course menu I have two complaints about this place though First the side rooms are not very well decored like the main room Second the portions on the dishes are inconsistent My girlfriend ordered the Mahi Mahi and it was cheaper and has more food than my dish I ordered the sea scallops for 27 and it has three pieces Note This place is louddddd 
-MotPOe7-FFjcSM4BULqhg Harvard Had the chicken sharawama Holy isht Batman it was amazing AND different flavored fruit Snapples No wai Seriously I m a n00b at Mediterranean food I literally went in there and was like so what do people get OK I ll get that OK yeah sure Uh huh Price is great amount is great large enough glass windows so I can creep on people walking down the sidewalks and not feel like a hamster Yeah so there was a mmm turnip in the wrap Might I warn you that it is AWESOME I m so bleh towards weird sounding vegetables SPINACH Whaaaa but wow Good food So If you ever decide to hit up the List Visual Center this is a perfect place for lunch Seriously You like jammin food down your throat this is a good joint 
-mSkS1icyHpGKpBMafaTTg Harvard Came here and splurged a bit on the Chef s Whim 6 course tasting From an amazing amuse bouche of squid noodles to a couple more than satisfying desserts everything was top notch First few were seafood the squid noodles crab scallop then faro pasta hanger steak ice cream and flan a couple macaroons to round out the night Trust the chef he knows what he s doing And he s very generous with the portions we left completely stuffed Waitress was very nice though we did have countless servers throughout the night Tucked away on a side street just behind Toscanini s this place is really a gem Makes me a happy girl 
-mTYHZiNDar95qHnDCnVYw Harvard One of the best cheap lunch spots near MIT a perennial favorite of mine Often crowded but still relatively quick even when there s a big line Once they overcharged me by two dollars and I didn t discover it until I checked my credit card statement weeks later I went back and explained what happened and the guy just gave me the 2 refund on the spot Mistakes happen and he really did the right thing rather than give me a whole story about how I had to have proof etc Good food good people 
-MVe_3lIdTXqAKoXGz2hxA Harvard Al Pastor Burrito for dinner Yes please Delicious and so much better than Ana s not trying to start a war it s my personal opinion The service and staff are so nice and friendly Eating in or taking to go is a pleasure 
-MvFSyPtNModwtU8bMh7Cw Harvard Firstly 10 cash minimum Come prepared Fantastic coffee Fantastic Their well pulled espresso drinks are some of the best I ve had in Cambridge I once indulged in some sort of flavored latte frippery which as a black coffee drinker I admit was a mistake but it was disappointing all the same and expensive to boot While drinks are surprisingly well priced beware a small is an 8 oz espresso size cup I don t mind terribly as I am generally of the opinion that portions are bigger than they need to be but it was surprising the first time around One thing I ve never been disappointed by the food The salads are always fresh have more upscale options berry feta is delicious and are a filling size The pastries are routinely fan freaking tastic and not to be missed Plus the place is beautiful Crema s exposed brick decor with its second floor loft seating is beautiful and welcoming Friends and guests I bring along always coo at its cuteness upon passing the threshold Given its quality and charming decor I have grudgingly accepted that I only ever stand a one in four chance of finding a seat This is fine in the summer but awkward during the winter if I wanted to sit and talk with my companion Truly sad however was my discovery that there is no WiFi in Crema But I guess then seats would be even harder to find so I ll take the trade off 
-mZCHg8WzN1CHEX6Xq8A0A Harvard Before a few rounds of pool at FTJs a friend and I wanted to grab a quick dinner On our way over to the nearby brewery we noticed this new place and decided to check out the menu I think we were so blown away by the decor not really in a good way that we didn t notice what exactly was on the menu But in the interest of supporting new small businesses we decided to try it out My friend got a funky salad but I went boring w a burger Our beer battered onion rings were awesome esp with the caper flavored dipping sauce I was excited to learn they were serving white sangria and my friend went with the waiter s suggested raspberry beer Unfortunately that was the end of the positives Half way through her salad my friend realized that the walnuts were cruelly dusted with something really really spicy Neither she nor I could finish it Which was too bad since my burger came out under cooked twice I gave up and they took it off the bill By that time I realized there wasn t really any alcohol in the sangria that I could notice and being a lightweight I would have definitely noticed consuming a glass of wine esp after eating only some onion slices and a few bites of salad I give the waiter credit he did try to make us happy I don t feel we experienced some of the Twilight Zone service some of the other Yelpers have mentioned luckily But I seriously doubt I will be making any effort to return there again soon Last minor gripe for someone with less than perfect vision the menu type is really hard to read 
-n70KjLgEwovqh3yr0nzGQ Harvard I tried this place on a Friday night It was suggested by a friend for drinks I d never been and some of the reviews here were good so we tried it out The location was really convenient I happened to drive in but lucked out with a free spot on a side street It s at basement level so its low key and private from the street above We sat outside on the patio area The service was quick and very friendly Good wine and drink selection The server suggested some new summer beers which we tried For appetizers the chicken quesadillas were really packed full of meat and vegetables and were great Around 10 they started moving the tables and to make the dance floor and the music started going and they were charging a cover The crowd was a diverse mix of people mostly in their 20 s I will check this place out again I hear Thursday s are really hopping 
-nadSqTtnbzMgRonS2i-bA Harvard Back East on family business from Portland OR Decided to revisit my favorite lunch place from the 80 s when I lived in Cambridge and worked at MIT Back then Mary s was located across the street and was BYOB Wow The memories flooded back as I enjoyed my old favorites Suan La Chow Show and Dun Dun Noodles I ve found Suan La Chow Show at Chinese restaurants in Arlington and Peabody but they are in a sweet sauce not the delightful spicy one served at Mary s Cash only but moderately priced Topped things off on the way out with a chat with Mary about the old days Chinese restaurant heaven 
-nfzivPz8zPD6JA1ocuSnw Harvard Their only claim to fame might be the first indian restaurant in cambridge but they do a good job holdin that title As one of the spicier restaurants I ve ever been to my boyfriend and I LOVE spicy food you can expect good portion sizes not too big but you ll get real full if you do appetizers too and the same waitress who is lovely It is a rather small restaurant that has a comfortable vibe and a huuuuuuuge menu to choose from I adore it but make sure you order enough nan garlic is my fave to cure the spice 
-NHmEzNPa7ykKaE_8EYKjg Harvard A group of five of us went to Rialto for my Birthday Dinner Those of us that arrived early had a drink at the bar while waiting the bartender was very friendly and suggested some very good wines from what we told him we liked He didn t harrass us but made sure we always had what we needed When we got to our table we saw it had been decorated with ribbons and sparkles what a cute touch for my birthday Our waiter Cesar I think it was was beyond fantastic The first thing out of his mouth was we re out of the salmon tonight but it s not very good anyway so you re not missing out There are some way better things He was very laid back and friendly helped us choose dishes and a bottle of wine with ease while recognizing that we weren t high rollers about to spring for the 200 bottles We each got something different and of course shared as 5 girls are wont to do Nobody had a bad meal that s for sure I started out with the parma prosciutto which came with quite a bit of food for the price I was pleasantly surprised Everything was very fresh and flavorful I got the scallops for my big meal and they were absolutely perfect Everyone else s meals were amazing too not one complaint Dessert was so amazing Once again Cesar did a great job explaining everything and giving recommendations We were all stuffed to the gills but just had to try something Mine was brought out with a candle and happy birthday written on it not over the top but really sweet While we ate the head chef came over I recognized her from the website to ask how everything was and wish me a happy birthday She was very personable and sweet very nice The GM also came over more than once to check on us and strike up conversations He and our waiter brought us over some complimentary desserts which we did not need but absolutely devoured and even a few glasses of some amazing dessert wine that we probably wouldn t have otherwise thought about ordering Everyone from the hostesses to the top brass was so friendly and sweet to us what a wonderful way to spend my birthday 
-NLGpWs3FRfQU5--mCF_uA Harvard I dig Cinderella s pizza a lot I find it s consistent fresh tasting and good I always forget this place though Apparently they re open late and I know they deliver I just don t have a menu I ve had to look it up online in obscure texts on MIT student webspace before what s that about UPDATE They mailed me a menu you can totally get them to deliver Toscanini s Ice Cream 
-NmbLCAqRiGkzmjhw3_TwQ Harvard Gorgeous Upstairs on the square is an experience for the eyes and nose taste is controlled by your ability to smell After my third visit to Upstairs I still find this place exciting and now even more rewarding since meeting Matthew the Director of Ops He has an incredible ability to remember a face and insures fantastic service While the food tends toward the expensive side Upstairs offers local grown vegetables and meats and local seafoods in ways you wouldn t think to enjoy in your own home It is a lovely locale to treat a friend your mother anyone special though I maintain that some men can t take the decor too many times in a year 
-nnS8RW5JQ5upcjmDgK9iA Harvard Unfortunately it s yet another generically named Indian place it d be nice to see some different names from time to time Like most Indian places the price range and general quality of meals is probably quite different for lunch and dinner I went here for dinner so no buffet I was pleased to find a Royal Dinner for Two which made the whole night very easy and not any more pricy than it would ve ended up being anyway They had the appetizers and we picked two entrees and two desserts The selection was much wider and more varied than average My taste for Indian is not quite as well tuned as I would like but I d say the dishes themselves ranged from about average the samosa the paneer to above average lamb dish we had the drinks the desserts for a slight fancy Indian place I ve had better elsewhere but the overall experience here was better and easier to manage The waitstaff was responsive and willing to answer my various questions about the food presented to me and quite willing to package it all up for us when we inevitably failed to finish all the food we got I ll definitely go back again 
-nntiIu8QkP9L_VxmHmMlQ Harvard Greater Boston being alongside with San Francisco the most European of metropolitan areas in the United States should have more eatery places like Moody s Falafel Palace This Central Sq obligated late night stop for God s hungry children offers healthy and tasty food from the Middle East at a very affordable price While in Europe it was easy to find these independent food stands which run at a small scale and don t hurt your wallet So far I ve been two times and I m already a fan Try the baba ganouj however it s spelled sandwich This is not a place for an elaborate date but I m sure a lady would appreciate if you showed her this convenient place for the first time 
-npSN90aZyVlh_0c52N3FQ Harvard Beautiful place terrible service We came for a birthday celebration party of 6 very excited to come in there for the first time What a huge disappointment The waiters screwed up on every meal course we had The appetizers the main course not a single dish was delivered to the correct person at the table When they brought the desert there was one with the Happy Birthday signed in chocolate on the plate Nice if it was actually put in front of the person who had the birthday The food was OK and only OK There was nothing interesting out of 6 different dishes And that would be fine but the service was so bad that maybe the food tasted it too The charge for service was automatic on the bill 100 Too bad the team of waiters did not deserve it 
-NrMvA2Cv9JWjp9p2R_UwQ Harvard Izzy s is one of those neighborhood institutions I wish we have at home in the DC suburbs We were treated like a neighbor the service was very friendly Food was very good of the home cooked variety I had the ox tail stew with a cup of the beef tripe soup Everything was great Lots of the neighborhood residents stopped by while we were eating to get carryout and chatted with the boss and his wife and son Would love to return again next time I m back in Boston 
-nSRcmtAkI-0D4_RxV2URg Harvard This is one of those places that I shouldn t review because I love it so much and I don t want people taking up all of the outdoor seating but here I go I love Cafe Pamplona because it offers me the opportunity to feel as if I am in Europe for the afternoon on a sunny day It manages to house itself in a small nook of Harvard where the street is less busy and the buildings surrounding it evoke a different time and or place I also love Cafe Pamplona because of the menu options This is also one of those places where I always give the specials a look over before ordering because today may be the day they are offering one of my favorites The waitstaff may at times seem to be a bit slow this is not the type of place to go to when you re in a hurry but in turn when you want to take your time at lunch the waitstaff does not breathe down your back to get moving even though you ve obviously finished your meal However the person waiting for a table may

-nVbBbArveLSKAqbshRA5Q Harvard A shiny new renovation does not make the food taste better I prefer the lunch buffet at Harvest of Indian on Mass Ave Food is so beautifully seasoned and you can actually relax there Serve is great also 
-N_yjghCq7rbLd5BRXd8sA Harvard The mint coffee is tasty A great place to have a meal with a friend Good location 
-O0mZsAZn0dJmv6eVqzJeg Harvard I d been wanting to go to this place for a while after seeing it s successful ratings and popularity on multiple sites including this one and hearing about it constantly from one of my friends So one night after heading home from a Bruins game my buddy and I not wanting to part ways quite yet we decided to head over there for a drink and some grub Unfortunatly for us by the time we got there they stopped serving food that sucked but it did our wallet a favor considering that their food is way overpriced I looked at the menu and was shocked at home expensive it was I go out a lot and it s the first time I ve seen a pulled pork sandwich hit 11 Honestly But there is one thing that in my opinion enabled them to escape with minimum review damage and a whooping four stars and that is their drinks menu They have some classic cocktails that you can t really find anywhere and that s I m very fond of Pimms Singapore Slinger Caiparinha Even the mojito FINALLY A PLACE THAT POURS THESE WHOOOHOO And for that alone I m a fan Needless to say that I had alcoholic drinks as my main food group and dinner that night Well worth it The decor itself is pretty cool and trendy and finding parking in the evening or night isn t usually too hard The bartenders are knowledgeable and actually talented compared to most I ve seen in Beantown they know what they are doing And it reflects Definitely a chill place I will be back 
1mZjVB1U2DPjWlOh2-Zn4g Princeton If you have never been to a Hooters then you just don t get it When we arrived this Hooters was located inside a shopping center and wasn t that busy We were greeted by many females with their Hooters popping out I like the idea that we get to pick where we want to sit I don t like the idea that we don t get to pick what girl serves us Our waitress fit the blonde stereotype perfectly You expect to have a good time at Hooters and she didn t bring her A game She also forgot a part of our order I wasn t impressed by her skills or her Hooters The food at Hooters is typical bar food After you eat here you can easily fall into a food coma I did love the buffalo shrimp so much that I had to order another round The loaded tots are good to share and you need to eat then with a fork I do love the fact that you have a roll of paper towels at the table The beer here is alright Our Hooters girl poured us glasses from our pitcher My glass was served with a crack in it This is a huge safety and health hazard The bathroom in the Hooters of Princeton is the dirtiest and most disgusting restaurant bathroom I have ever been in There was even poo on the toilet seat I would definitely try to find another Hooters to visit if you want to see Hooters 
1n-OvM_eRgJy8_goUFJ-mw Princeton This time I had the veggieburger sans sauce It was delicious crisp spicy and firm with fresh lettuce summer tomatoes and hot hot onions that made my nostrils burn I m gonna do that again soon The fries were pretty good too but I left half of them on the plate cause there were too many to be reasonable Also coffee was hot and Samara was incredibly attentive You win PJ s 
1N27iTI3jO_2V5yQIxvhFg Princeton Romeos added a nice outdoor seating area a couple of years ago which is probably its best feature The food in the restaurant section is pretty typical suburban italian fare I m not sure why an Italian restaurant that seems to be run by actual Italian people makes food that seems so dull maybe it s the market they are in Plainsboro isn t exactly Little Italy The pizza side of the restaurant is a little better but still just about average Oh well if you are hungry go to Romeos just don t expect too much 
1n2ZXT6DhGC6-G9ct1syew Princeton I rarely find myself at P F Chang s mainly because I try to eat at more indie spots but every time I find myself dining at one I am always very happy and this location was no exception The wonton soup was stellar I could see heading in for just that and some Sapporo and calling it a day we also had lettuce wraps which were really good but they always are and mongolian beef I am not gonna lie I have had better Mongolian beef but all in all I was a big fan the service was prompt the beer was cold and the food was delish If I am ever in the neighborhood again I would stop back in for sure 
1NzBjnRw5g6hxkKfox5jEA Princeton Good if you re in a pinch and in the area and browsing picking out goodies is fun but I wouldn t go out of my way to come here About 750 difference places to pay and only certain items can be paid for at certain registers so the whole experience is kind of long winded and confusing Very visually appealing setup and worth checking out at your leisure 
1ODk_O5GvZTjqs9LcRoVtw Princeton The Sushi here was decent Not the best I have ever had but for the area it is very good I went during the off time between lunch and dinner and therefore didn t have to wait I tried many different rolls and the ones that stood out were the Stacey Roll which I have had before at Kenji Fusion and the Salmon Skin because I have never had any Roll like it before The Stacey mostly because of it s sauce can stack up to Rolls at any Sushi spot But I found everything to be just good The price was reasonable The Decor is very modern and gives the place an upscale feel even though there are some dings and scrapes on the walls I have only tried the Sushi so I can t speak to the other dishes If there was a rating for 2 5 stars I would probably give it that 
1ODX-YUVN-UP53XOusf77A Princeton The falafel sandwiches here are off the wall It s a beautiful grab it and go store with tons of variety I also really dig the wide sampling of interesting drinks and sodas available Absolutely perfect for a quick lunch or picnic takeout 
1OQdaznkYrIbr-qR3VAvgA Princeton First time there thought to myself Hope this isn t a bad decision It wasn t however I ordered the pla lard prik white fish lightly fried with coconut chili sauce Very good but not as spicy as I would have liked The service was fast the bill cheap and the water glass full constantly I can see why some reviews are negative but I enjoyed my meal thoroughly 4 stars for great service and solid food 
1OuBl8RODxbxdKSZ0XvX9g Princeton can go toe to toe with anyplace I ve dined at in NYC and for us a neighborhood place which really treats you like it never had a bad dish wine list and cocktails are excellent and extensive Jeff is a miracle for wine selections and hosts tastings too 
1p6o167uNS5cwE35lqqLiA Princeton We love the quality taste and price Only drawback is no indoor seating 
1Q-4sSlEj4adEKybD70kQA Princeton Love this place very tasty entrees good salads and an excellent choice of good wines The pizza and wine tasting on Mondays is a treat Wait staff is well informed and pleasant 
1qEm7NiqRjm3ok4Z7A2D-Q Princeton are you guys all mental THIS PLACE SUCKS a few years ago my brother told me we should go eat there because it was really good and has a lot of food at least the second part of that was true my brother and i BOTH got diarrhea before we even left the joint uh oh it is way worse quality than any mcdonald s white castle wendy s etc everything is soooo greasy and the desserts make me want to vomit they had some cloudy white jell o cubes that looked suspicious they were also serving chicken feet i have to admit i tried them bad idea jeans yeah they have a great selection of horrible oily garbage maybe i should try the american food but like at that point why even go to a chinese buffet i agree with the person who said that it was hilarious but the food is definitely so so so bad 
1QfK4bSwsJ1TAxBelMIoXg Princeton I am an easy customer to please I overtip I don t ask for things made special for me I ve done the job so I empathize with those serving me That said my experience here was unfortunate Ordered the Epic Burger it wasn t epic Small with a poor choice of bun and accompanied by I kid you not about 20 fries We sat at the bar and I m sorry to say the bartender had no redeeming qualities You don t have to chat me up just be somewhat friendly pay attention to empty beer glasses in a reasonable amount of time The beer was decent 
1Qsv-viCLe35xDd8KBxxFQ Princeton The hoagies at Hoagie Haven are the best You don t have to travel to Philly for the perfect hoagie when you have this awesome place in Princeton NJ The hoagie roll they use for their hoagies and hot sandwiches are amazing It is so soft the texture is perfect It s all about the roll and Hoagie Haven is right on the mark They are also very generous with the amount of meat and toppings they put into their sandwiches Their hoagies are not for the faint at heart so be prepared to have your cholesterol checked before you visit this place This is the best sandwich shop in Princeton and probably in NJ They have a huge menu of hoagie subs and hot subs similar to the ones you will see in the grease trucks at Rutgers University These grease hoagies are also popular at Hoagie Haven The lines are long so be prepared to wait but they also close late if your looking for a midnight snack My favorite hoagies are their classic italian hoagie and they have the BEST eggplant parmesan hoagie as well 
1QUbA8MSqr_1i_KTSuciCg Princeton Make sure you don t order the peasant omlette unless you want potatoes with your potatoes you get more sausage in a jimmie dean sandwich and that won t cost you 9 bucks not worth it I really wanted a better experience since I like to support local business but this is not up to par for my standards especially with the price tag 
1QVgDWl9WTr2fgf6wTrIUA Princeton My wife and I went here for lunch We enjoyed the experience and the food While there is a glut of Japanese restaurants in Princeton including Sakura Express Moc Moc Tomo sushi and others the only legitimately Japanese restaurant is Ajihei whose owner is Japanese and worked as a chef for a pricey Manhattan place That being said my wife and I thought this was one of the best places we have been to The atmosphere is cookie cutter tatami fixtures but they accent the place well and give it a peaceful feel The food is generally served in bentou style lunch box settings more elaborate combos including tsukemono traditional sides or yakitori skewers The food is capable for the price I am not sure what Lu Y means by claiming the curry is terrible It s standard Japanese curry They are capable of making a Chicken Katsu correctly unlike Sakura Express or Tomo Sushi 11 as a bento with curry fish and spring rolls a simple salad and miso soup and my wife enjoyed her pick 3 for 12 lunch combo also including the soup and salad 
1rhrmKk6MB_vO_NIU2B09g Princeton Service can be very slow and inattentive The wait for a table can get fairly long as well Atmosphere nothing very special here Clean and neat Price much too high considering the quality of the food and service 20 40 or higher per person Food hit or miss some things are amazing others are sub par 
1rxn8_fmFrKRdzhICeVHHA Princeton Maybe I had too high of an expectation after reading some of the reviews The food is okay but nothing special 
1SlexGDknZA4_rpt7wDCyQ Princeton I don t think this place needs reviews since it was beyond capacity on Saturday nights If you ve ever tried the efes in new Brunswick this is very similar and that s a good thing for those who haven t had the other place Very surprised by the first review Granted service wasn t excellent but that s not their forte their food however should have compensated I would suggest he take another attempt their food is very nice and one of the very few turkish places in a 20 mile radius I also suggest people try Istanbul Cafe in North Brunswick We always order an appetizer platter at every mediterranean spot and a chicken kebab platter Here we enjoyed all the appetizers and a solid 4 Marinated and juicy chicken very well done about 15 minutes waiting The combo platter is good if you like meat since thats the focus but note the gyro meat is delicious Definitely stop by for either sandwiches pick up and go though For those eating platters have it nice and warm 
1sopjD7FbDXxgtVEq7EyRw Princeton I don t really understand the hype I have no problem with Small World except the crowds if you like a crowded atmosphere you might really love it here It s just not my scene They make a splendid spicy chai that will clear out your sinuses it s great 
1TChI1tU3QSITdd69VT29Q Princeton Taste of Mexico offers good unpretentious Mexican food prepared from scratch in front of you at decent prices The ambiance sucks the restaurant is in a strip mall with four tables and bar seating with a few outside tables when weather permits but the food is solid enough that we keep going back Due to limited space some things like the chips and salsa are clearly off the shelf although the entrees are all freshly prepared In particular the tacos al pastor are really good as are the enchiladas Don t be afraid to ask if you want your food spicier as the default is somewhat mild 
1tr1-Msr0F7JdrvTaknoIw Princeton So I met a few friends and had lunch here It s not a place I would typically eat 1 cause I m a vegetarian with the exception of fish every once in a while and 2 cause I m not a huge fan of BBQ taskting food aka steak house food but that is where they wanted to go so we did I had the fish special which was very good pricy yes but good I know this might sound weird but I love the decor of the bathrooms I know people don t go to a place based on what the bathroom looks like but I needed to say it The bathrooms are gorgous Dark wood and earthy tile LOVE IT Anyway so my friends love the food there and eveyone seems to like it so based on that and on what I had to eat I give it a 3 and 4 for ambiance and decor But keep in mind if you aren t a big meat eater like myself you don t really have much options except for like one or two things 
1tvxbB2153gQQR6fvfPukA Princeton Great thin crust pizza We went with sausage and red peppers and another with pepperoni Generous with the toppings and great flavors Sausage was a little spicy and had a kick You order first then get some drinks at the bar you sit when your pizza is ready Old school building but delicious pizza will deff be back 
1U-7QWepf5etf-R0othe1g Princeton Phenomenal meal here last week with a business associate The place was bustling the food was phenomenal the service was superb I loved this place and I can t wait to get back to that neighborhood to eat here again the food was VERY VERY VERY good 
1uNaOE7h9dhcSz27GaOZuA Princeton The hands down BEST vegetarian food I have ever eaten I got the curry supreme the first and only time I ve eaten there so far but had a taste of my dad s sweet and sour sensation and both dishes were to die for Most of the main dishes come with either taro spring rolls vegetable spring rolls with a softer shell than usual and brown and red rice both of which I had never tried before but they were a nice complement to my meal Hopefully next time I m in Princeton I can eat there again Thank you Zen Palate for expanding MY palate 
1vbTKrWbl6jfbiVsuohNyQ Princeton Omg i don t know if it was my selection of food that i chose but this was the worst chinese food I d ever had in my life My stomach aches at the thought of it I almost had to force it down 
1vOGG_riiCu_Te1OLPe4Mg Princeton I go to Small World everyday for an expresso based drink so I can t comment on the drip coffee Lattes and cappuccinos are fantastic and usually have plenty of rich coffee flavor The drinks are fairly consistent even with different baristas The staff are friendly and make drinks quickly and there is free wifi Almost always busy short wait though so I m not the only one who loves this place 
1vSWnsNFxnsssvCfKmaT_w Princeton The staff couldn t be any nicer and they have the most impressive selection of chips of any deli I ve ever visited but the thing that makes them really great They carry Lightlife Smart Deli vegan slices in ham and turkey Get a combo throw in a bag of Wise Onion Rings 
1VW3mxBpXqc6x4zrFK0woQ Princeton The bar offers a club like atmosphere and the big horseshoe bar sits in front of a large Normal Rockwell attributed it s unsigned painting of Yankee Doodle that s fun to enjoy while having a pint on a Saturday Afternoon Princeton is not a town of super great bars and this the A B and Triumph make the borough s first tier Reasonably priced never noisy or overly crowded it s a great place to go with a few friends The food here is pretty good a big step above pub stuff The composed salads are particularly nice 
1W4ciYghmIlgwUNA0ssP_g Princeton I had Sunday brunch here with my family The atmosphere is charming especially around the holidays if you like that ye old pub kind of stuff which I do It s tastefully decorated and cozy and the staff is very nice The food here is OK and my impression is that they are going for the gastro pub trend but it s more American B B hotel fare than English foodie style food The bread basket had too many overly sweet things and not enough savories and my Paris Brest Salmon with eggs was just ok What I would definitely recommend The eggnog New to the menu it is rich frothy and strong They make it with peanut butter which I found very interesting you can t taste it but the richness is there I think this place has a lot of potential but they need to decide which direction to go on the food Either keep it pricey as it is now and turn it up a few notches or make it cheap and cheerful I m not sure that I d go back for a full meal but I would definitely stop by in the evening for a pint and an appetizer 
1WHA0CqT8KX_AB9eCLWuJg Princeton Hoagie Haven is a Princeton institution Cheap delicious fast and greasy food Whether it s noon and you re sober or midnight and you re drunk Hoagie Haven is delicious I highly recommend the cheese fries or buffalo cheese fries buffalo fries or honey mustard cheese fries or any of the fat sandwiches George s next door usually does better hot sandwiches though better quality chicken at least so if you are going during the day it might be worth checking George s out instead Otherwise they have the same owners and make basically the same food 
1WJb78rjsqYFDzNWWqQc0g Princeton This is one of my favorite places in the Princeton area The outdoor Cabana is my favorite place to hangout being the only outdoor bar in the area for one but on top of that great frozen drinks and the food always consistent and delicious Try the mussels or the seared tuna i mean really I have enjoyed everything I have ordered The ambiance is very chill and relax so great for hanging out with friends I would definitely recommend Main Street Bistro to anyone looking for good food and ambiance The staff is extremely friendly and accomodating as well Never had a bad experience here 
1WJzCJ4BEi6zsd5GSiyVfw Princeton My girlfriend had the m nage trois vegetable entree The fried tofu and stuffed pepper were good I had the grilled shrimp salad Good flavor but for a entree salad it was a bit small Plenty of shrimp and other items could have used some more lettuce We sat outside in the patio ish area but the plastic sides were closed because of wet weather A bit humid and warm but understandable since it was not a real room Barely waited two minutes for a table on a late August Friday night at about 7pm Nice wait staff albeit a bit spread thin Nice touch having Hershey s Kisses instead of mints on the way out Would have been 3 5 stars if Yelp let me but I ll round up for this one 
1x7RoP8Xy5vR0EOwetsuiw Princeton I recently joined a number of my work colleagues for lunch at nearby Ganges Generally I have a pretty poor opinion of Indian restaurants in the area The food usually is pretty underwhelming bland and appears to be put together by non chefs cooks who know the ingredients but really can t cook well they can do just enough to get by I will say that my standards for Indian food are extremely high since both my wife I can really cook good Indian food We had about 8 of us going to lunch Kedar Danielle and I left the office on time and waited and waited and waited for the others to turn up Turns out Bill kept everyone waiting I would have just left him behind Anyway onto the food We did the buffet which is the typical Indian lunch thing The assortment wasn t great They had the typical chicken tikka masala which seemed watered down a few vegetable dishes tandoori chicken usually the worst thing to eat in a buffet and Ganges did not disappoint There weren t any lamb dishes what the heck They did have masala dosa if requested which we obviously did But it took them forever to bring out the right chutney I was done with my dosa by the time it came out Dessert was way too sweet as is usual with Indian desserts We ordered the chai which was excessively milky and short on spices The others seemed to like this place somewhat more than I did All I have to say is either they don t know Indian food or their standards leave a lot to be desired I for one will not return www foodielifestyle com 
1Xc1QGvW64v8jFrnYTlPJA Princeton If I was rating this place solely on dessert I d give it a 4 The key lime pie was phenomenal and the peach raspberry cobbler great But alas I m not rating it only on dessert I had the Gaucho Steak which comes with corn cakes and sauteed onions The steak was tasty but the portion was small Most of my plate was taken up by three corn cakes and a ton of onions The corn cakes were literally corn and batter that was fried into a pseudo pancake They were extremely bland The tiny amount of steak I was given for 18 was good The only reason I m giving a 3 instead of a 2 is the sole appetizer I had that was great Their Korean Short Rib BBQ sliders were awesome No complaints there That bumps them back up to 3 status in the hope that perhaps some of their other menu items are better 
1XNjbKts-Tzw2DmSHw9sIA Princeton I ve had better It was edible but I wasn t really enjoying my food here 
1YB-1gzVPQw9ecPg4fa2KQ Princeton After picking up a water heater in Whiting we were hungry Ganges was en route had a few new reviews and Indian food sounded good Very friendly service It was a bit chilly near the A C so our server turned it down I left my sweater in the car Jim ordered a lassi which was tangy and not overly sweet We were off to a good start The Chicken 65 was interesting and good bright red pieces of chewy but tender chicken with mild to medium hot pan fried green chiles and crispy curry leaves Not very spicy but good We are not sure which poori we ordered or received What we got were crispy 2 puffs filled with chickpeas and onion topped with crunchy noodles and a sweet and tangy yogurt tamarind sauce which we scooped up it tasted like apricot and honey over a super tangy yogurt This may have been Dahi Sev Poori with chickpeas instead of potatoes Then our usual lamb saag though with a side of roti instead of naan There is heat in this one it builds up nicely 50 of the dish was lamb and it was not as tender as some places a knife was needed but the flavour was very good We overate picking at it for another 10 minutes after telling one another we were more than full The rice was good neither dry and crumbly nor mushy The spicy mint sauce was excellent nearly as good as Taj Mahal s in Brooklyn Including tax but not tip 33 with a full set of leftovers The service is very attentive but not in your face The server s will come by when you appear cold you don t have to call them over When the plates need changing someone will show up Ditto for water We didn t have to ask for anything Even perusing the menus we took our time and once we decided we were ready the server showed up This is awesome There are also Indian styled Chinese dishes served here which have gotten press recently and intrigue me They re also open past 9PM Yeah Open Tue Thu 11 30am 3pm 5 30pm 10pm Fri 11 30am 3pm 5 30pm 10 30pm Sat 11 30am 3 30pm 5 30pm 10 30pm 
1yNzvZkV-51fgmAVEwmskw Princeton This place is pretty much a middle of the road neighborhood favorite It s a nice go to if you really have no other choices or ideas on where to eat drink since princeton is lacking in the latter The menu is american favorites and nothing extraordinary but nothing particularly bad the bar is ok small and cramped though when crowded One time me and my friends wanted to get drinks and one of our group wanted to eat so we were seated in the dining area But since three of us weren t eating they kicked us out into the bar area where my friend had to eat her bowl of chili holding it while perched on a bar stool It was pretty ridiculous so it s deterred me from bringing a mix group of people ie people who have eaten and want a drink along with people who just want to drink it s either or They have an excellent sunday brunch however 
1Ys8c815E-opWSuYdXzQyg Princeton I didn t know what to expect when I walked into ONE 53 for dinner I had read very little about the restaurant online and didn t do my normal drool ritual while looking at the menu Overall the dinner was a pleasant surprise The appetizers were fresh and prepared well letting the ingredients themselves shine on the dish The clams were fresh and the sauce they sat in complimented them well but wasn t overly complex The beet salad was fresh and simply prepared The entrees were similar in design simple and straight forward with no fancy sauces to mask the meats I chose the chicken milanese which was lightly breaded not too oily and a controlled enough cook to keep the moistness in the chicken A fresh tomato salsa esque sauce accompanied it The chef s preparation was smart letting the breadcrumbs and capers in the tomato salsa provide the right amount of salt The other diners I was with got the burger which was cooked with just as much care The standout component on the dish was the truffle mayo aioli Silly to love a sauce but this is worth sticking in your purse and bringing it home with you Overall ONE 53 is a great place that pays a lot of attention to its dishes the meats sauces and components on it Every addition on the plate is purposeful and meant to add a taste or texture to the plate which is how plates should be made 
1yxx-2hJLYy6zE45t3CtRw Princeton Great Food I love the udon the combo plates and the sushi rolls They are always very busy and are very fresh Food is a good portion too on the combo plates They deliver pretty fast as well if you can t make it out to them This place is a win in my book Great spot for lunch or a great home delivery place for folks in the area 
1ZVs3pBkB57AtdzfE1yNiQ Princeton Thought I d give them another try at my sister s urging so I reluctantly agreed The place was packed and we had to wait about 40 minutes for our pizza We ordered a mushroom and onion pie and when it came to the table it was well done burnt When I made a comment to the waitress she got all snotty and told us that s what we asked for We did not I would never ask for my pizza to be well done only a fool would The edges of the pizza were actually black She then again with an attitude told us they d make us another pizza but we d have to wait another 40 minutes I said no because number one we did not want to wait and number 2 I knew that that the guy making the pizza would slap his Johnson on the dough and spit a juicy honker into the sauce I asked for my money back and got it I left a nickle for the half drank soda s and a condom on the table as a tip I would never want that waitress to breed As far as I am concerned I d die of starvation before ever coming back to this red neck dump We ended up getting a great hoagie at a hoagie shop in Princeton I can see by their overall rating of 3 5 that I am not the only one complaining and they ARE NOT the excellent place they once were And to the clown who said this is not a pizzeria and is a pizza joint is full of it Some of the best pizzas in NJ are to be had in Taverns 
1_CTHSMIC70pgSTdpcIKcQ Princeton From the outside Sushi Palace looks like the kind of place where the food should kill you The stripmall ambiance does NOT inspire a lot of confidence but having eaten here 4 5 times I have found that I really enjoy the food I definitely agree with some of the other reviews that the sushi isn t of the highest quality even though it s always fresh and safe For example the texture of the tuna roll is weird because the tuna is shredded and kind of pulpy rather than a solid block of meat However the sashimi and fried rolls are good and they have some really tasty and creative rolls that feature mango and avocado Moreover you can always just pig out on seaweed salad miso soup shrimp tempura edamame and pork shu mai like we do the sushi is almost an afterthought sometimes 
1_pjvYL-0eDq9jN0d2uR4Q Princeton Nice atmosphere quick and friendly service The food is a bit overpriced but it s nice for a happy hour 
1_zI7ZxDM5ikb_un-PQm1A Princeton Most of the stuff comes with salad bar so you don t need to order an appetizer just to stave off any intense hunger We realized this too late While the salad bar is somewhat limited you can make something decent and they have pre made salads potato salad apple salad etc The dressings aren t labeled either This is pretty much what you d expected for a mid range restaurant chain it does the job of feeding you but the food isn t majorly impressive in any way Chicken tenders 5 pieces Ketchup Couple pieces of lettuce Not much more Just as good as any fast food chain Chicken cajun gumbo heavy oily The sausage is funny tasting The shrimp overcooked A fairly large quantity of food Salsa Guac the guac is a little homogeneous not enough of that chunky avocado The salsa is too chunky simple tasteless basically diced tomato onion cilantro etc Not like a dip at all Free cheesy bread balls these were actually pretty good The bread had a decent crisp to it warm and soft on the inside good savory flavor Artichoke dip a little heavy a little salty Lava cake not super impressive The cake was a little dry 
20kLF7Fi0js45_CxcVQhhw Princeton We ordered Spicy Maki Combo and a Nabeyaki Udon The blandest Nabeyaki I ve ever tasted Whoever cooked this soup obviously read the description somewhere and tried to throw it together out of their not even following some kind of basic recipe instructions It was so awkwardly made and just completely wrong that I ve erased the memory out of my mind It was closer to a chinese hot pot with cabbage and noodles and no additional flavoring They had no clue what is Shichimi Nanami Togarashi or have anything similar to it to flavor the soup and make it less gross I felt taken advantage of Spicy Maki Combo was slightly below average compared to sushi around the area considering the sushi in the area isn t very good though there are a few shining exceptions Urban trash sushi with princeton prices not sure how this place will stay in business 
20oBZ45yo0wa0w9TJMNF7w Princeton Sushi is good Insults are free cash register at Sakura Express I think many people now consider Sakura Express an institution of Princeton as it is known for its bargain sushi and its owners who love to tell dirty jokes on you It s true that there are a lot of regulars who love Sakura but the number of university students who frequent Sakura has nosedived since last year Prices magically went up 30 50 over the summer and for many of us who walked into Sakura the first day back on campus ready for some good grub we were quite simply hit by sticker shock My friends walked out after seeing the new prices unable to comprehend such madness I suppose most would still consider Sakura a bargain but I long for the days when I could get 3 rolls for 12 now 16 a gyu don for 5 50 now 8 50 and a salmon teriyaki for 6 50 now 10 00 The food is and always has been generous but that is not to say the quality is good If you want quality go to Ajihei I still don t advocate Ichiban under any budget circumstance But for a budget sushi meal I infinitely prefer Teriyaki Boy The rolls at Sakura are messy with rice bursting out of its seams Moreover the pickled radishes I had at the salad bar today tasted like they had gone bad or been marinated in alcohol I love that stuff and I had to throw them all out How do you f up pickled vegetables Teriyaki Boy offers better made rolls and unlike Sakura prices haven t changed in the past 5 years Side note I would avoid kitchen entrees at T Boy though I suppose Sakura will continue to thrive despite the hike in prices since patrons are usually well to do residents supplemented by new waves of unknowing freshman Eventually old farts like me will graduate and nobody will remember the good ol days so I will immortalize it in Yelp 
239sJ63H0Lc2pmlF6hq9WQ Princeton Amazing Indian food Best spinach dal and dahi sev poori that I ve ever had My husband had a lamb dish that he immensely enjoyed The naan was also excellent I know it s just naan but I ve had bad naan before 
23A0Kc7CQtPx_o2faENIoA Princeton Went there for lunch for our anniversary It was WAY overpriced and worse yet I walked out hungry due to puny serving sizes I ordered the deckel for 26 the best part of a rib eye steak What came out were three tiny pieces of meat each the size of my thumb FOR 26 I complained to the waiter and the manager came over to offer something additional Nice gesture but what is this let s make a deal Besides I am a firm believer in restaurants especially high end ones putting their best foot forward So they wound up NOT bringing me any sides on the house nor even trying to make it up to us with a dessert on the house we ordered and paid for two desserts Besides the taste of the food was only ok Instead I suggest saving money having equally fine cuisine AND leaving on a full stomach by visiting Eno Terra in Princteon Kingston 
23xjJHSW5ENwZ8j4wboSmg Princeton This place isn t much to look at so get your food to go That being said the food is amazing One of the best cheesesteaks I ve ever had and probably the 2nd best from NJ White House in Atlantic City would be 1 The prices are more than fair and the portion sizes are huge An order of fries easily feeds 2 people Next time though I ll skip the extra peppers and onions on my cheesesteak Wasn t really worth the extra couple of bucks since I barely noticed them 
24wsea35vu7hs9WmKmOt8w Princeton I heart Teresa s It is one of the few restaurants in Princeton that is casual fun classy and AFFORDABLE all at the same time And it s absolutely delish Whenever I want to have a nice dinner out without breaking the bank my friends and I inevitably gravitate towards Teresa s charming friendly and totally delicious pastas pizzas They have two kitchens one open where they make all of their pizza and another in back where they handle all of the other foods If I m feeling broke I usually go for the pizzas as they are definitely on a lower price spectrum than the pastas The pizzas 9 13 are thin beauties with a slightly chewy crust with fresh high quality toppings Sometimes I wish the crust were slightly charred a la Old World but that is more a personal preference Usually though I go straight for the pastas 12 18 My favorite is the Conchiglie Balsamico a deliciously creamy dish with a tang of shell shaped pasta with slivers of asparagus and tender chicken It s a dish with innovative flavors though the sauce may not appeal to everyone I suggested it once to my mom s friend who wasn t a fan but everyone else I know has liked it I also like the Linguine Vongole and Penne all Arrabbiata with more straightforward flavors but cooked very well none the less They also like to use organic ingredients so don t be surprised if you see Raised Right chicken or Simply Grazin beef I think it s a little snobby but the names themselves are pretty humorous in and of themselves Also if you like nutella the dessert pizza is yummm Sure conceptually the dish is ridiculously simple but can you make a pizza crust like Teresa can No probably not In short while in NY I would probably rate Teresa s a solid 4 this is really as good as it gets without breaking the bank at Princeton 
24y-wk3YeQVXSbMubeCdhw Princeton I should confess that I am currently sprawled out on the sofa in my hotel room holding my tummy and making happy yummy noises This is due to the fact that we wandered into downtown Princeton tonight and ate dinner at the Witherspoon Grill The WG as the locals call it is located next to the library in the quaint little town surrounding the famous university Reservations are required for inside seating but they have a nice covered patio space which allows for al fresco dining Live jazz was playing inside so the ambience was quite nice despite the oppressive heat humidity My business partner and I took our clients to dinner and between the five of us we happily mowed our way through appetizers steaks chops sides and desserts over a leisurely evening Our server was terrific making many helpful suggestions filling the glasses and bread basket and enhancing the dining experience without disrupting our business conversations I started with a cup of lobster bisque which was perfectly seasoned with nice chunks of lobster meat in the soup That was followed by the dry aged strip steak seared on the outside for a nice crust and then pink and juicy in the center Creamed spinach for the side with a healthy dose of garlic I m not normally one for desert but our server recommended a vanilla caramel ice cream sprinkled with sea salt which was made across the street at an organic sweets shop The bill for the five of us was 250 which included the tip Certainly not an outrageous cost for such a terrific meal Great place for a dinner date or an expense account treat insert happy yummy noises here 
28DFLF0ufm1iZt6mGLo3VQ Princeton Elements was recommended to me by a good friend He would be pleased and not so pleased with my experience I had lunch The appetizer was really lovely a Dandelion Gazpacho which came with a preserved lemon ice cream hazelnut bits cucumber shavings and rosemary flowers Spectacular It was bitter and smooth the flower flavor was so delicate and gave the dish a great green snap The hazelnut added a little crunch along with two very crunchy croutons With this I had a glass of the NV Zardetto Prosecco which went perfectly as it was dry Then came the main course pork belly with shrimp The small variety of shrimp were perfectly cooked The spicy sauce was very spicy and the little on the plate went a long way There was a cashew butter sauce as well which had a nice cooling effect However I didn t understand the pork belly at all Most people love the crisp melt in your mouth quality of pork belly This was not crisp It was not seasoned It was like a lump of fat on the plate hard hard to chew not heated not easy to cut with the knife provided Such a shame I would give this restuarnt another chance Sous Chef Mike Ryan is part of the Williams Sonoma Sou Chef Series and I just got his recipe for Mushroom Soup which I can t wait to try Also the waiter rushed me out the door I hate when that happens So two bad marks on an otherwise great visit 
28UpfZDyuxAP3dz98f_XYg Princeton My wife and I have been recommending the Blue Point Grill for years The seafood is fresh and the prices are reasonable It addition the place is BYOB When dining here we usually start our meal with oysters which are excellent We have dined here over the years at least a dozen times Myself I usually opt for the Branzini which is a mild Mediterranean fish The place is rather small with seating outside during the summer when the weather permits Sometimes they also have small groups of musicians playing outside So you can enjoy a bottle of wine while waiting for your table Parking is usually hard to find on the street but they have a small parking on the side between the restaurant and the Ivy Inn which is next door The Ivy is a dive bar but you can get a good cocktail here before your meal Once seated you enjoy a great meal without being rushed for the next seating 
2A9Y3J2UIQi7DlTNTcAgOA Princeton Boring run down typical cheep chineese food service was slow at best We had to ask for more tea since after the food was delivered they never came back to the table Go elsewhere 
2Azc--Jtqb-Aj1qKTRT3Mg Princeton Very pleasant experience What you see is what you get Yes the price is on the high side but the quality and guilt free feeling you get after eating the pizza is worth the premium Would eat again 
2B2_LeFL7o_Qsj7dHXPecw Princeton Tasty and good A bit pricey 
2B3Vzn_AVR4-KW8jWb1iyA Princeton I work in town and have just started going here for lunch Although it is pretty crowded during the lunch rush it s perfect for a late 2 00 lunch I m hooked on the Pizzettas especially the one with Arugula Prosciutto I would highly recommend them if you want great food at a reasonable price 
2BkmyzwdEI8UVjCO2eXXFw Princeton yumm great chicken gyros under 5 cheese fries sandwiches and tons of other food they have a pretty cheap and fast to go their cheese steak is huge they have a decent drink selection and you can sit outside after you get your food on a nice day on the benches 
2brFXEBGBE9kmuNhIbx6Vw Princeton I think J B Winberie s was the very first restaurant I visited in Princeton some 20 years ago while there visiting former student It struck me then as it does now as the quintessential Ivy League college town eatery pub somehow exactly what you would think that would be with lot of wood and that pub in the cellar sort of feel Was back this time to visit yet another student so we stopped here for a quick meal on a Sunday evening Split a great salad and had a fabulous burger that was juicy and loaded with things that are particularly good for you The menu is quite extensive but with so many artsy restaurants in the neighborhood this doesn t seem like the place you d want to go for chicken cordon blue Not sure that was on the menu but you get my drift A really good sandwich burger and beer place is what THIS is 
2ClIBsWLfj_E15lePLxiIQ Princeton I had heard from several people that this place was really good I had lunch there on a Friday afternoon around 2pm and it was wonderful This place offers a much more refined experience than your average pizza shop It is relatively small however they offer outside seating in the back on the patio which is quite lovely The variety of choices is very nice and especially the fact that the owner seems to go out of his way to use ingredients that are natural and organic as much as possible My friend and I shared the Antonia la Caprisiossa pizza my half without the salami along with the heirloom beet salad Fresh crispy and delicious Along with Blueberry ice tea and a lemonade our total bill was 35 Service was really great and quite friendly Recommended 
2dLn6PZJaUqZViK1DHap8Q Princeton My husband and I ate here almost every Friday night this past Summer There was no wait then but we ve been afraid to try it now that the students are back in session The sushi quality is superb The kitchen can get backed up but the wait staff is lovely I m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the decor is lacking and the menu has no variety Given the setting it s a bit expensive 
2do-SE2Q3uFPNNrmpL-aXg Princeton I might not be an expert on Japanese food but I ve tried many restaurants in the area and this one cannot be beat in my book Maybe it s not authentic but I love their chicken teriyaki and they boast a huge menu of sushi that covers the gamut The staff are friendly and the sushi chef is a pro not to mention interesting to watch and interact with 
2EEifvHQqUwYA3Y4pVWphA Princeton wow The best Homemade pasta great food romantic and great wine list Love it 
2eLsbKIX0LerVrQwH2z4FQ Princeton This place isn t anything special but we find ourselves going there a lot because its one of the most convenient when walking around Princeton its not toooo stuffy although its still in Princeton so you know never have to wait for a table and for our single friends there is usually a crowd of other singles for them to mingle albeit cramped mingling with Beer isn t too expensive appetizers are good for vegetarians although I don t think I ve ordered anything but apps I like the cheese dip with apples Overall its a pretty casual place thats nice and centrally located 
2eQz7y4wtdhSBv3yhxf6eA Princeton Everyone s always talking about this place so I decided to finally try it I was expecting to be bedazzled by a sub but ended up being disappointed by a mediocre cheesesteak I don t get why this place is so hyped up I mean i ll try another sub next time perhaps one of the more famous ones but I m not a fan so far Maybe it s a Jersey thing 
2es3-bgTb5fYb8CMjR2HfQ Princeton Best restaurant in town and around Great food great staff Their cheese steak and wings are bomb 
2etLyfji3kY9VTh0UoVQxQ Princeton Main Street Bistro has been a longtime fixture at the Princeton Shopping center and continues to provide very good dining at a very fair price We go often to MSB to avoid the higher priced mediocrity you ll find in Princeton Favorites here include the lamb sliders really excellent the monthly changing of the menu to include new dishes outside dining in the warmer months and the new cabana bar to enjoy a drink or more 
2EvnNfRvIbKzWtvSbLA3ZQ Princeton This is my favorite steakhouse in the area I can honestly say I ve never had a bad meal here I usually get the prime rib and the KC fries are really good too The ambiance is nice as well Quiet and kind of swanky It s not the cheapest place you can find in the area that s one drawback I guess But compared to other high end steakhouses I prefer it 
2f23GlATB4KKhbQSL6Mo6A Princeton WOW what an experience The food and spirits were amazing Had the watermelon salad and morrocan scallops which was incredible For dessert had three tiny scoop of the most unbelievable bent spoon Creations Thought I had died and went to heaven Was not your run of the mill check either 125 00 for two with 2 drinks All in all a gastronomical treat 
2f_XKFMP7oiYIeBm7zsrqg Princeton 24 7 good coffee good drink selection salads sandwiches and pretty much every grocery item you can normally think of May I add that the hoagies sandwiches here are ridiculously good and cheap and they pretty much have everything you ll need including random items such as batteries and bug repellent It s a one stop shop with delicious hoagies Try one if you re in town 
2g0PDwuc1mKkIs_fij3jIA Princeton Nice servers but painfully slow Food is good but relatively overpriced fOr the area 
2gaIFNc2i-uz7AMVWLomHg Princeton Love their food stylish interior and the service is always great Love it here 
2gzJBxOO9NzVcBMtyEZO-A Princeton Pros Bartenders and Waitstaff are excellent Menu is dynamic and usually done well Managers seem to care which matters Obviously the alcohol is a draw but the food and open face chicken sandwich and calamari especially are brilliant Cons hard to get a seat they can get real snooty about bar area stools requiring full dinner orders Hostess quality is as bad as the bartender staff is good amazing to have such a disparity Price can vary rapidly across the menu Still a decent place if you have a reservation or can somehow catch it on a quiet night Decent people watching at worst part of a great princeton bar crawl at best 
2H6BBD0ylFGXQRgkfs376A Princeton The name of this restaurant kind of misled me to think of what I would imagine this place to be I thought this place was a noodle specialty place selling udon ramen wonton etc Instead this place is just a standard low end Chinese restaurant The place is not all that clean Waiters are rude and you feel rushed Food its meh All in all just a standard Chinese restaurant nothing special Don t waste your time here unless you are in the mood for cheap Chinese food FYI This place accepts cash only 
2hbrgmJaJKEVDlKjHNs-gw Princeton When you are in the burbs it s so hard to find a good restaurant among the landscape of chains I have been coming to Sahara Restaurant since I was little and it was my introduction to Middle Eastern food Perhaps my 4 star rating is slightly bias because of this connection to it but I still think the food is rather good I actually would probably rate it lower if it were the same place in the city but given the lack of good eats around here they get a boost I have never had a bad meal here but I dislike that they don t let you order sandwiches later in the day and that it must be platters Sometimes I m just not that hungry The decor has barely changed since I was a kid I remember they renovated at some point but it doesn t look that much better 
2JvmN5rziE-Wce7VdAWYFA Urbana I don t think I share the opinion of the other reviewers It looks okay but not super trendy This place is a ripoff and the food is just not that good The teppan is okay but they dump a bunch of sweet and sour sauce on everything The lunch buffet is not that good The Korean dishes are okay but I think I would rather go to B Won The sushi is okay but really expensive and not that good I would rather go here than Ko Fusion but that s not saying much 
2KVZMURKlYSyi2ueugc-0A Urbana I always enjoy the chipolte steak soft tacos and the black beans 
2lLxkoZYQzFhVGIGhr5wjA Urbana I was extremely disappointed by Bevier cafe during the 2012 summer On many occasions the food was inconsistently portioned or prepared For example the country fried steak on several occasions was extremely greasy with oil oozing off of batter a clear sign that it was not cooked at a high enough temperature When broccoli and beef over rice was offered take out orders simply were not portioned with enough food For a dish over 5 there should be more than two pieces of beef Items billed as hot sandwiches arrived cold with cheese not even partially melted As this is a student run enterprise let s hope that the Fall batch of students are more detail oriented and the quality improves 
2Mf3F2OuPgPUG9FF6MXrBw Urbana I am from Champaign raised there until the age of 20 when I escaped to Austin I still go back every year for Christmas to visit family and friends and when I do Seven Saints is a must hit place for food And I get the same thing every single time The Triple S Combo Platter One salmon slider BLT salad although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad sounds weird but was really tasty And the tomato basil soup This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off possibly a bad day But every year it always pleases me And the bill isn t so bad I don t really drink here but have had a mojito that was alright nothing special I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting Please stay in business Seven Saints otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won t be pretty 
2mZDfcy6E2SMaTv-UZWr1g Urbana Geovanti s is the best place on campus to get your deep fried grease fix Don t expect health food or vegetarian options because the very blue collar cooks throw everything in the deep fryer This place bills itself as a bar and grill but the nightlife is mediocre at best On Friday night usually there are usually 3 or 4 guys in the basement bar sipping cheap American light beer 
2N1FEdeZtlPMKALiUJeHXg Urbana I had heard about this place about 6 months before I tried it out and I m mad at myself for missing out for so long The food is affordable for a student on a budget and the atmosphere is perfect for a date or group outing It s the perfect place for students to bring their visiting parents too The beer comes in sizes ranging from 4oz to 16oz so you can try different brews if you re in the mood for that The Tomato Bread salad is absolutely phenomenal and I have added chicken to it and had that as my entree on more than one occasion This is one restaurant I really miss since graduating U of I and leaving the area 
2nj4SrKu7DS2q0qwpg-i9A Urbana It can be good it can be bad Never attempt to order food for delivery from here It will take well over an hour and be ice cold and mushy There is much better drunk food There is much better sober food Chipotle is better than this Qdoba 
2nSiqOVmLzsxRJQvwPkoRQ Urbana If you re looking for cheap authentic Mexican food this is the place Yeah the place isn t the greatest looking place to eat but the food is fresh and flavorful I really like the different choices of meat on the menu besides just chicken and beef My friends and I ordered some chips and guacamole as starters and the guacamole was very fresh In addition the place is also a grocery store with meat spices avocado and etc The price isn t too bad at the grocery store at all The avocado seems fresher than the ones you would buy at the big chain grocery stores If you want a recommendation on something from the grocery store I would ask the owner who works there He s super nice and friendly 
2NsQve6UYvWAsLZqZ9S2vQ Urbana I stopped in to try the lunch slice special It was as it is advertised 2 slices of either pepperoni sausage or cheese and a bottled drink for an even 5 I chose a slice of pepperoni sausage I am very picky when it comes to sausage on a pizza and this sausage was very good too me The pizza didn t remind me of Garcia s The two crusts and flavors are very different I really don t like Garcia s sausage at all I always pick if off The pizza left my hands and face feeling very greasy and that totally grossed me out They have no napkins so make sure you are prepared for that I would like to note that someone in our office ordered the Hawaiian pizza for delivery and I tried a slice of it and I thought it was really tasty but then again the grease is what mainly gets me down I would like to try the thin crust so I might change the star rating if I think it improves 
2nvpDDJb1Zlwai4YARGkfA Urbana During weekdays I often stop by Rainbow Garden to pick up food as it has bargain lunch prices and is one of the few options on Neil Street that isn t fast food For around 5 to 6 you can buy a lunch combination meal that consists of a generous portion of your chosen entree rice soup and an eggroll My personal favorites are the chicken and green beans barbecue pork and snow peas and cashew shrimp Some dishes I ve tried in the past have been a little too salty and oily the Szechuan vegetables come to mind but I ve enjoyed most of the dishes I ve ordered Of the Chinese restaurants currently in the Champaign Urbana area I would consider Rainbow Garden to be the best option for a date The outside of the restaurant might seem somewhat unimpressive and grungy but the interior has a very sophisticated atmosphere with white tablecloths and dark red walls By American standards the wait staff might seem rude at times but their cold disposition is considered formal and polite in Chinese culture A previous review complained that the staff is unaccommodating and will not make adjustments to orders However I have previously asked the owners about special items and they have been attentive and considerate of my requests Rainbow Garden has also offered a special menu of delicacies during previous celebrations of Chinese New Year though from what I ve heard they might not be repeating this menu in the future still I think it s worthwhile to check on any potential Chinese New Year specialties 
2O9bSy91psHETv8ujexk8g Urbana Um Pokey Sticks are just cheese bread in pseudo pizza form They re okay I m not overwhelmed I m not delighted But they do what they re supposed to do I guess as a U of I grad student I m supposed to be enamored with the Pokeytasticness but as a former fan of Gumby yeah that s right 1980s cartoons were fun growing up and a fan of pizza I am required to say it s only okay That said the staff is really friendly But um not the greatest thing ever I guess my friends Pokey Prickle and Goo should all show up but that s probably the only thing that would make it at least remotely interesting 
2OMolFA7cWd9qs_pzIXkHQ Urbana Love the specials The Cuban is the best 
2plItngALXg8Y9NIPCZ1xA Urbana This place was awesome The service was great and very friendly We went for early dinner and had cheeseburger fries shakes and biscuits and gravy Everything was really tasty although diner y so you know it s probably not the best thing to eat every day Very well priced under 20 for all this good stuff and close to campus Highly recommend 
2prwLPcQvNvJ8ErRG5jC_w Urbana I went there with my friends who loved to try Korean foods We have tried bulgogi Brittos Budaejjigae bibimbap and dduckboggi Brittos is quite interesting Totally new tastes I heard that they have these korean style brittos and tacos in CA Probably these are from CA Budaejjigae is awsome Enough amonut and yammy spicy But too little Korean dishes I hope they can make Dolsot bibimbap soon which is my all time favorate korean food Above of all of that very clean restaurant especially restroom which is very important to me Clean and enough space for gathering friends and yammy food I will be back there soon 
2r15uCVW7im7Amk_Yn7P_A Urbana Ate here Saturday evening 12 10 11 for dinner with my girlfriend Ordered the Cheese Curds as an appetizer my gf ordered the Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese and I had the Ribeye Steak sandwich We both had two drinks with our dinner Cheese curds came before the meal and they turned out to be pretty good Nothing to rave about but average At last our meal was delivered The bun for my Ribeye sandwich turned out to be what looked like Texas toast As I peeled back the bread to look at my sandwich I was in for a huge let down This was the absolute worst excuse for a ribeye steak sandwich My biggest complaint it was paper thin PAPER THIN Literately speaking my steak was no thicker than a cardboard coaster The price tag on this steak sandwich was 10 This is my biggest pet peeves when it comes to steak sandwiches I don t mind paying upwards of 15 for a steak sandwich but I expect good quality This was such a poor excuse for ribeye I had to eat it with the top piece of toast off just to taste the meat How dare they insult their customers with such a poor excuse for a steak sandwich My gf equally hated her grilled cheese for reasons she will explain in her own review Once the check arrived 52 we asked to speak with the manager We both expressed our concerns with Andy the manager We felt like after spending 50 we should leave the restaurant full and satisfied Instead we were leaving hungry miserable and downright insulted Andy rattled off various reason as to why my steak might have been a little on the thin side He apologized for the size of the steak and offered us 2 free drinks to make up for our poor experience REALLY We spent over 50 and all he was going to do was give us two free drinks No thanks We refused the free drinks and made sure he knew he just lost two customers for good I m not looking for a handout I m not looking for my money back but the way he handled our situation was horrible If a customer spends 50 in your restaurant and absolutely hated the food two drinks is not enough to make up for this I expected a credit or a gift card to come back and give Seven Saints another chance Now I will never be back I can find steak sandwiches comparable to the one I had at Seven Saints at Taffies or Steak n Shake Keep your two free drinks Just know we will spread the word to anyone who will listen I hope you handle future situations better 
2RyYX7jw24ChPxX-y5Y2KA Urbana I went for lunch here in December and was rather impressed by the food and service I recommended the place to my friends and we went there for dinner yesterday To my dismay the food was bad enough that I feel compelled to write this review My friend and I had the saffron risotto and it was horrible It wasn t creamy in fact it was soupy and bland The risotto itself was underwhelming with more green peas in it than actual rice grains The shrimp was overcooked and tough Worse I couldn t even taste a hint of saffron Needless to say we were not impressed Another friend had the mushroom and asparagus linguine with prosciutto The pasta was of an unappetizing soft texture and the dish was overly greasy The prosciutto tasted more like salted pork Their only redeeming feature was the crab cake appetizer I don t think I could recommend this place to anyone after what they served us for dinner yesterday Definitely not worth the price would have rather gone to Cafe Luna or Bacarro 
2S8_EB_uYhGUU7ywpsmXLg Urbana I m sorry everyone Maybe it s not fair that I review this as I love thin crust pizza so much Maybe it s also not fair that I was served after the pizza was delivered and then I waited in line for several minutes Maybe it was the ridiculous hype that everyone brought with it that was its downfall With those things in mind one of the worst pizzas ever I took a quick picture on my phone see http www yelp com biz_photos u8C8pRvaHXg3PgDrsUHJHQ select KEIMjrhuV466cpYyYI8nhw and sent it to a friend He wrote back calling it bread lasagna Maybe it wasn t very good because it had been sitting out for 5 or 10 minutes after being delivered It had almost no flavor though And it was ALL bread I ve had deep dish before that was much better I would be willing to try it again fresh at the restaurant if I didn t live 1000 miles away 
2SE8_qC3P2v-FvUO9Bxd-w Urbana It s all about customization here You can create one bowl of stir fry goodness or for 2 more an unlimited number of bowls After assembling various grains veggies and meat you have the option of putting other add ons into your meal represented by different colored sticks I ve always been a fan of the blue stick roti flatbread beware it is kinda greasy This Flat Top has a roomy interior but the L shaped buffet bar is cramped They always have exotic beverages here like desert pear pomegranate or chipotle pineapple lemonade margaritas and mojitos Refreshing and trendy 
2SudWi2937SYnbdS37HR8A Urbana I had 2 different beers they were both pretty good I ordered the mussels Over half were not open I sent them back Second time about 5 were not open not acceptable to me The broth was good however I also had the pepperoni pizza It was decent My bf got the cod it was very tasty Next time I will probably try an entree It was very busy when we went but we sat in the bar Service was good 
2t0WS5MyXJaPIg_obcO_gQ Urbana I must admit it is taking a little while for this place to grow on me but mainly because I like simple food without all of the frou frou fanfare But I thought it worth mentioning that I had a fantastic hangar steak and garlic mashed potatoes there recently Very simple just meat and potatoes It was great And the restaurants is very nice inside as well we like the bar area 
2tva8WYjM47XMhcJB4PyPA Urbana I was going to Zorba s to have gyros until I explored this place and I m regretful about the time which I wasted in Zorba s Niro s Gyros on University Ave is a great place to have gyros Fast and delicious Also cheap You pay less than 8 for a value meal Also they have a deal when you get 2 gyro sandwiches you can get 1 free Only disadvantage of the place is that they have no indoor area because they work like a take away Anyhow this is the best gyros place in C U area 
2U5JgzZzGO1_TPqiAIK_3Q Urbana I had a very pleasant experience here The hostess who sat us was very friendly and helpful The decor of the restaurant is trendy but also inviting and it is a comfortable place to eat The food was delicious and I had a fun experience putting it together I was nervous mixing so many sauces and ingredients at first but it all turned out to taste amazing together I don t think you can really go wrong when making it The servers were very friendly also and I would definitely come back again 
2UlPYBI_4PhW98GeG6IHEQ Urbana The Garlic Pork is very good My family picks this as one of their favorite places to eat 
2UuPd_qoH2O0mW_G-dBezw Urbana DO NOT go here if you are looking for some chrome and glass ubermodern quail egg topped with scallion serving trying too hard to be trendy cafe DO go here if you are looking for decent Midwestern breakfast served in a cozy albeit kitschy venue for a decent price Woo for 1 Yummy biscuits that are an option instead of toast 2 Tasty sounding pancake options including the special that day pumpkin 3 A place that I can get an old fashioned chocolate soda Hellllooooo Boo for 1 A waitress who mistook my coffee order I got regular instead of the cinnamon almond which was the special 2 A waitress who slops coffee all over the table when setting down our mugs and then never cleans it up but clearly eyeballs the running liquid several times when passing by 3 Regular coffee that was so weak it looked like broth when I added a dollop of cream 4 Cold hash browns not that I had room to eat them anyway I was assured that the service is usually much better and more friendly I guess they were caught off guard with the rush of Dad s Weekend Menu options were enticing so I ll be back 
2VbfYqqxIQp0mk8G1ozU_A Urbana I have been here three times The first time my experience was awful What I ordered was uneatable and I sent it back and asked that it not be returned We ordered the fried mushrooms as an appetizer and loved them The second visit I decided to play it safe and ordered a simple sandwich It was bland and I didn t enjoy it very much Again we ordered the mushrooms and they were fantastic The third visit was so much better I ordered the fish taco lunch combo with chips and salsa and French onion soup The French onion soup was really good They didn t throw a bunch of croutons in it which is a plus in my book The fish taco was really good too I asked for extra chipolte sauce which made it that much better The chips and salsa were OK The chips were good but the salsa was on the bland side I also think it is somewhat pricey for lunch If you are looking for a better lunch deal then go to Friday s where they offer a lot more lunch combos at a much better price I will go back here again Especially with a group so we can order the mushrooms again They are so good Word of warning though they are big and I think you get 6 or 8 of them You will need help eating them 
2vLFhsiRTlYH0gtbAAVy_w Urbana I m a little too young to remember this place as R R s and I had stopped working here by the time they brought the shark bowl back but I was one of the first employees of this place when it reopened FINALLY as Firehaus in 05 This bar took a long time to get on its feet and by then I was tired of not making any money due to lack of clientle so I had moved on But now it s kicking ass and taking names and has a whole lot of loyal customers and for that I give this bar all sorts of props Also I just said props Ew Anyway the really excellent thing about this bar is that it is CLEAN Clean clean clean Even on Unofficial which is arguably the dirtiest day on campus all year the bathrooms at Firehaus will be clean The layout isn t my favorite as there aren t a whole lot of places to sit but the beer garden is excellent and the buffalo chicken sandwich with pasta salad was pretty damned good Of all the Cochrane bars on campus this one is without a doubt the best 
2VlWeAemTOxCUcehPRJhKQ Urbana First the good 301 Mongolia has a cool atmosphere great selection of ingredients for their bowls and excellent cocktails Now the bad The sauces just weren t very flavorful My husband had to go back to the buffet several times to get more sauce just to try and get some flavor The roti bread was only ok Finally we both got bits of food that were not in our bowl not cool If I want Asian grill I ll probably just go to Flat Top 
2vOfSkP0-ROueOKRT6Tolw Urbana Wow I will certainly be coming back And I will edit this review as fits I m new in town and hadn t heard of this place but my date had been here once before and enjoyed it We went on a Monday evening It s a small restaurant and I ve heard people complain about how it is decorated and kept but I really liked it It was clean and neat and small inside though it is in a strip of bars and other neon lighted windows If you think you re in the wrong place you might not be Once you get inside however it s decorated like your classic Thai restaurant We got the summer rolls as an appetizer and that was the beginning of the yum experience Very fresh veggies in a light wrapping dipped in a spiced peanut sauce I didn t think it could get any tastier until I got my dish a house curry with tofu I forget the exact name of it now I ll edit this later for it The first one on the curry menu though it s really worth trying I got a 3 5 4 spicy rating yes I did ask for the 5 thank you very much I like how they have this scale to be honest Anyways delicious Perfectly spiced not just in a hot way but in a everything is done right down to the last grain of spice perfect I don t even know how to describe it aside from that The tofu was cooked perfectly as well We washed it down with oolong tea from bags but this wasn t sad enough to keep this place from five stars If you know my ratings you know that means that this place was INCREDIBLE The service was also excellent we had two young ladies as our waitresses because one was training and the other teaching Unlike many trainees our waitress was very professional even though it was apparent that she was new The waitresses were very attentive and the service overall was very fast but did not give up any quality for the speed Anyways this place is a must try Oh yeah if you try and Google map this you get real Siam over in Thailand Just a warning Thanks Google 
2VqKNvzXvoiZ0OQNLugGuw Urbana I am not vegan or vegetarian but my friend is so I went with him and thought I would try it I had the BBQ seitan and for someone who doesn t eat that type of thing normally it was actually pretty good It had the look feel and taste of bbq pork I also had a side salad that had a yummy herb vingearatte I don t think I would go back again because I like my meat but it was definitely tasty and if you are looking for a vegetarian type of place definitely go check it out 
2vvB41Zwx03u0F44sgy_8w Urbana If you re too lazy to read my novel no judgment here is a summary Seven Saints awesome I m sure you ve seen a lot of 5 star reviews on Yelp and thought to yourself this person s 5 star is probably a 3 in my book so I think you need a little back story to understand just how hard it is to score the coveted 5 red stars in my book I m high maintenance I m also spoiled I m from California where there are actually more than six places to choose from for cocktails and late night dining It s not that I don t love quaint little Champaign Urbana but if a place doesn t live up to your expectations there are not many other options to choose from Ask any of my friends they heard me complain about this for months when I first moved here over three years ago Then I found Seven Saints This place excels in everything I look for customer service quality product and environment As you can see from the pictures the ambiance is warm intimate and inviting The seating and decor create an environment that is perfect for enjoying time with a date group of friends coworkers and even people you don t really like but are forced to hang out with once in a while Their menu has what I like to think of as fancy versions of classic Midwestern treats They are famous for their sliders try the Black Jack Slider come back here and thank me Or go for the hat trick and add on the Salmon Slider and California Turkey Slider and thank me three times The lovely waitresses waiters are always friendly and attentive It s amazing how they stay on top of tables orders when it gets busy As for drinks I m just starting to learn about beer and they have a wide selection to choose from Tuesdays they have beer specials which is a great time to sample things I wouldn t normally order And now for my favorite part Whiskey Wednesday I ve waited over two years to write this review because I treated Whiskey Wednesday like Fight Club it s so awesome you aren t supposed to talk about it The guilt has pushed me and I feel it is now time to let those of you who don t know in on this marvelous secret every Wednesday they feature 50 off their whiskey menu That s right This isn t a fake out Miko s 50 off either This is an unbelievable selection of quality whiskeys from around the world for half the price They rotate weeks from North American Irish Bourbon and Scotch in addition to weekly featured bottles I m not cool enough to call myself a whiskey connoisseur but I am very stuck up about my whiskey The two Whiskey Wednesday bartenders are amazing and are always able to find new and exciting things for me behind the bar They REALLY know their stuff Try it Go in and pick any whiskey off the menu They can tell you about the grain barrels aging process blend everything I can t even remember what I had for lunch yesterday They are extremely helpful and know the full range of whiskey flavors I ve been in many times with friends who don t drink whiskey often or are just starting out and want to go easy It doesn t matter how experienced you are the Whiskey Wednesday boys will take care of you Andy is the general manager and I can never say too many good things about him At most other restaurants you ll see the manager walking around to check things out but that s about it Andy introduces himself and actually talks to the customers He is always around to make sure people have a good experience It s a pleasure to listen to him tell you about the history behind a specific bottle or cocktail If you ve seen him on the CBS morning show you can tell how passionate he is about what he does So yes I just gushed about Seven Saints but I mean every word of it The quality products excellent customer service are enough to satisfy this high maintenance Californian I m also narcissistic enough to believe you ll actually come back on here to thank me Seriously Go check them out I ll see you again soon 
2WF9GuHilZU3I7pH6eVpSg Urbana Breads are all very good The espresso is terrible 
2xofgnLiwp-6xwbvv3vagQ Urbana This place survives because it is on campus and very conveniently located it is also the only restaurant within striking distance of the university that serves wine and has cloth napkins which means that it is full of administrators and professors The food is not at all good but it has no competition if you need to take adults out to a semi decent restaurant you can walk to from campus You should definitely avoid anything involving duck as a topping because it basically comes out looking and tasting exactly like pastrami from Schnuck s If you like that ignore what I wrote 
2xvzpV7vr2Q-Lzafr8hr6Q Urbana I ve only ordered through delivery here but so far my experience with this place has been excellent The woman who normally takes my order over the phone also tends to be the person to deliver the food to me She is a sweetheart and when I ordered from a different phone number than I normally do she recognized my address right away when I gave it to her and asked how I was doing What a great memory and way to connect with your customers Now for the food I ve only ordered a couple dishes from here but I feel no need to change my order any time soon Mongolian beef and the General Tso s is the usual First of all I love that they make no questions about making things spicy extra spicy The mongolian beef is ordinarily not spicy but when I asked if they could add some spice they enthusiastically said yes I haven t ordered it unspicy since The beef is sooo tender and the sauce they cook it in is to die for I literally would eat it everyday if I had a heart of steel The General Tso s is pretty good although not outstanding It s a little too sweet and saucy for my taste but I like to have something to contrast the beef so this is usually what I go for The only other dish I ve ordered is the Fried Diced Chicken w Red Pepper It s pretty much a party in your mouth Super spicy just how I like it the chicken is cut up small covered in batter and deep fried almost like popcorn chicken and salty which is awesome with a plain white rice The only reason I don t order this all the time is because it s a little too spicy that I don t want to always regret eating it the next day So I can t speak for a ton of dishes but the ones I ve had thus far have been very palatable And the delivery service is great Woohoo 
2xWRGXZCQ7TXE2OZA3d_mQ Urbana Great atmosphere and excellent deserts 
2y0ArxjBh-JpADw6cPV4pw Urbana I had the greatest experience at Esquire We went for lunch and had a waiter who was friendly talkative and helpful but not overbearing Our food was delicious came hot and was inexpensive The BEST thing was that we were talking about how we love Strongbow on draft and our waiter chimed in that he thought Bentley s had it and actually CALLED over there to make sure It was a wonderful experience 
2YERaYxp46o_EeIBXf7gsQ Urbana Love their juicy beef rice but not the cold noodle It s nice that they have free spicy bean sprout soup all the time Price is fair and service isn t bad 
2yPyUGI90e3Mwb4-5xdUew Urbana Still good food like before the fire but the salads seem smaller The new modern style totally ruined the comfortable atmosphere 
2ztAvHzboE76ggv0hBIkOw Urbana Very good food lots of interesting choices that are not available anywhere else in town A funky atmosphere and unusual ordering process but the service is fine for what it is Don t eat here if you want the typical sit down with a waiter dining experience and don t eat here if you are unwilling to take a little time to parse the menu They have English translations of it but come with Chinese friends and have more fun figuring it all out 
3-hsH7e0xLT6om8aT5EkfQ Urbana I ve eaten here all throughout undergrad and stopped by again this past weekend while visiting campus My absolute favorite dish Indonesian Fried Rice did not disappoint think huge pieces of shrimp and chicken in a bed of delicious seasoned rice with a spicy kick and the perfect runny egg to top it off They have really good authentic Chinese dishes as well Mapo Tofu Crispy Tofu Pork and Bittermelon Three Cup Chicken The owner is incredibly nice and overall the service is very friendly If you are looking for a no fuss place and delish authentic Chinese food or their more American counterparts Cashew Chicken Orange Chicken etc for reasonable prices you ve come to the right place Cravings I love you 
30cfxSUC-qKouiNgwZuFuQ Urbana I ve eaten the brisket of Texas and the vinegared pork of North Carolina I ve savored the best meats in Memphis and met Kansas City s Arthur Bryant himself Li l Porgy s is the best barbeque I have ever had 
30w4hR6Iv2kczijAfPpsHg Urbana Even back home in the San Francisco Bay Area it s hard to find a lounge where good drinks small crowds great ambiance and plenty of good seating mesh The seating at Boltinis is comfortable and intimate Think black leather semi circle booths with high backs in the middle of the room Towards the back of the room are black leather rectangular IKEA couches with glass tables and candlelight everywhere The drinks are large mixed well strong and tasty Personally I prefer a perfect half dry half sweet vermouth gin martini shaken You CANNOT go wrong with the cheese plates here Make sure to come at least in a group of four so you can order the 3 cheese plate You choose from a cheese list and it is brought out with sliced baguettes toasted and non toasted fruit green apple slices grapes and olives I would highly recommend the gueyere euro cream and the cheese infused with port wine But seriously pick and choose to your hearts content because the pairing of great cheese with great drinks will make you feel reallll sexy I exposed my friends for the first time to Boltinis last weekend and they were highly impressed with the classy setting quick servers and amazing cheese and drinks Even on a hectic Saturday night we found a nice seating area in the back of the pit for all 8 of us Boltini Lounge is a place that should stay hidden thank God it s in dtown Champaign and not on campus for its adventurous sick of underage teenybopper gangsta wannabes discriminating clientele I tell my friends that Boltini Lounge is where the people sick of the same scene at Joe s Fubar or even SoMa turn to We will be there again tomorrow night for a birthday EDIT Only downside is that they don t serve wine So unfortunately you can t bring your own bottle of nice wine to enjoy here But I guess you re supposed to be here for the martinis right 
319tG93Pgs4_UG8tlc-pUA Urbana This was my favorite place to get Gyros in town Despite the heated debate over who had the best gyros Zorba s vs Niro s Gyros I always sided with Zorba s the fixins added to the gyro tomato onions and whatever else you wanted were always fresh and great quality something that NIro s seemed to lack on more than one occasion Zorba s had daily specials like Groovy Tuesdays one dollar off classic gyro meals which kept me coming back every Tuesday I attended classes at the University of Illinois However on Wednesday March 23 2011 Zorba s was affected by the fire that started in the apartments above the business As of now I don t know when if ever they ll re open their shop on Green St But here s to hoping 
32HO_usYTWH0FKmje4maVw Urbana I ordered 3 chinese dishes from this restaurant It was AWFUL The food had no flavor and the meat tasted horrible I ordered authentic Chinese dishes but it was awful I do not recommend at all I couldn t eat two of the dishes and the third one three cup chicken was decent but nothing to write home about 
33GaASlC7ALqpb2F23oIcg Urbana Solid cheap drunk food And when you re having a greasy day don t want to cook and want something different Their gyros are the only thing good 
34Ds_2o8diz_pWZpfp2NGA Urbana Unlimited soup and quality bulgogi bbq I m also a big fan of the bibimbap and uh the cold buckwheat noodles and pear I have no idea what it s called but it s delicious 
36BUCiTzUoCBdwmJp4WZsQ Urbana Is it just me or is the guy who works there an ass I don t know if he s trying to pull a Billy Goat s type of act but instead of being funny he just pisses me off Other than that though it s a good place to stop by after a night at the bars as it s right smack dab in the middle of Green Street and fulfills your alcohol induced craving for artery clogging grease I wouldn t stop by for food during the day as there are many more healthful choices around Champaign It appears that everyone else agrees since Big Mouth s is almost always completely empty during the day You get some good deals and the food isn t too bad but I still wish it hadn t replaced Sushi County 
36eIadOPNhw_tuRAySNVBg Urbana Look I don t live here and I know nothing about Antonio s Pizza I was interested in learning about their pizza and so I ordered some Thing is it never arrived About an hour after ordering we called We were assured it was running behind and the driver had left 40 min ago Well at this point we were looking forward to the prospect of 40 minute old pizza but not to worry it never showed up We tried calling several times afterwards and no one answered I sincerely hope everyone at Antonio s is well and that some tragic incident didn t interrupt our pizza but never before has pizza just not showed up At least the courtesy of a phone call you ask Nothing 
37kZLjdTb0NKYntA9XY5hg Urbana This review is on their breakfast only as I have never been there for anything else I have now had the pleasure of ordering all of the 5 burrito choices that must be made before 11 AM Some of my favorites include egg sausage jalapenos and a queso sauce The best things abou this place though is the great customer service When not busy I enjoy talking with one of the gentleman who are working When it is I normally read the student run campus newspaper The Daily Illini that they place on each of the tables or just enjoy the pandora station they have playing over the air For awhile when I was going more frequently one of the employees remembered my name They also have free wifi which is great For me one of the best grab and go or quick breakfast options on campus 
39M43t0qGJhH4D5f9UEURg Urbana Best Italian restaurant in Champaign Urbana Great food great atmosphere 
3aij1bgsE1AgA53IIE52dQ Urbana Arrived in Champaign late on Christmas Eve and the hotel had stopped serving food We hit the snow filled road to find some grub actually I was pining for a piece of pumpkin pie The Merry Ann s near our hotel was closed but we spied another one that was open 24 hours It was as if I d walked into a time warp the menu the decor and the pricing was unusual for this California gal I was thrilled to get a piece of pie and even happier for the 2 price There s nothing on a menu for 2 in California not even a sharing charge My partner had a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich with fries It may have been the processed American cheese slices but she was hungry I m glad I wasn t too hungry because the vegetarian options were quite limited and if I d stuck to my veganism I d be SOL 
3AmrQUGQ9B60Sourn5g10Q Urbana Pretty awesome Mediterranean food for Champaign I ve only been here once but my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it Our food came quickly and while we were waiting we watched what seemed to be a Middle Eastern version of MTV which was pretty entertaining We also didn t spend that much but walked out with a ton of food leftover enough for us to eat an entire lunch the next day The only downside of this place for me at least was the atmosphere and decorations I thought it was a little weird and disconnected but if you come in for a quick bite and just want some good food it s a nice spot to go 
3AtqdrOXEJWfDwFddGuemA Urbana I love this place Plenty of people have written about the food too many amazing dishes to list but I could live on the sweet potato fries and the ribs and the beer the selection is so good and it rotates and it s so cold and delicious But once you get spoiled enough by the food and you start to take it for granted because after all you know that it will be fantastic and you don t care if you have to wait and you don t even care if you have to sit at the weird little time out table in the very back you start to ask yourself the hard questions What exactly is it that makes this place so amazing What is the one ingredient that brings it all into harmony Well after twenty visits I ve figure it out It s that waiter You know the one The ironic hipster with the glasses and the longish hair who knows every single thing about all of the beer selections and all of the food and who is probably the guy responsible for the fact that Tom Waits is playing and you can just hear it under the really loud sound of the game on the tv at the bar This guy is free from the shackles of his hipster tribe because he s nice He s kind He will figure you out and he will use this knowledge responsibly This guy will tell you everything you need to know He will not patronize you rush you brush you off or forget your table He will shine his magical hipster doofus sparkle charm on you He is the patron saint of this restaurant Go there and ask him to tell you what to eat and what to drink Obey him Thank him Seriously who is this guy I love this guy 
3AzM1iJkdD5wg4s2j26usQ Urbana One of my favorite restaurants in town Not only their ribs are good but the sweet potato fries are awesome 
3b-FgrFl3PaTaodB4WxgSw Urbana Great Chinese I think it was a bit over hyped for me and so I was let down a bit but it s better than anything else I ve had in Chambana 
3bEK8B4XOdKgaR1a7s4hrg Urbana I had to restrain myself from writing this review right after eating here for dinner last night because I was afraid my distended tummy and satisfied tastebuds would ve influenced my review Well This place is great Very good tapas considering this is Urbana Champaign A tad expensive a 76 bill for three but that doesn t stop me from planning to make the rare excursion back Last night my sister mom and I headed down to V Picasso with reservations at 6 PM NO NEED FOR RESERVATIONS at that time my god there were like three tables filled It s a very pretty place all dark and sleek with lighted candles on each table There are two places to sit an actual dining area with plushy red booths and small tables and then a sports bar like area which unfortunately got filled with rowdy drunk college guys as the night went on Our server Audrey was incredibly helpful with the menu and her suggestions for the dates and churros were wonderfully enjoyed We ordered about 8 dishes including spinach croquettes the aforementioned bacon wrapped dates grilled zucchini blackened cod tempura shrimp the specialty for the night shrimp ceviche green string beans lavendar creme brulee and creme filled mini churros The Bad green beans tempura shrimp and shrimp ceviche The green beans were just blah with slivers of almonds A waste of 5 The tempura shrimp was redeemed only because of the delicious red pepper aioli that I swear I would take a bath in it was so good The shrimp ceviche oh the ceviche WHAT THE HECK A weird amalgam of tomatoes and olive and roasted red peppers and jalapenos blegh No Do not recommend The Oh So Good the dates ooh the dates and the spinach croquettes the COD The dates were stuffed with gorgonzola cheese and walnuts and then wrapped in crispy sweet bacon I don t like gorgonzola blue cheese at all but these I devoured these babies I dreamed about those dates last night Really The spinach croquette oozed with cheese and wilted spinach and they changed it a bit so instead of two greasy cakes out came out three crispy morsels Yum And finally blackened cod that was nestled on top of this tomato reduction that was slightly spicy Mmm I was never a fan of blackened fish but it was deliciously crusted in spices I need to go back and try the other tapas 
3cfDIpHMS9UGD4oWWhjFYQ Urbana It was meh the food was too salty and frankly the quality was just not worth the price BYOB is a nice feature which earned them 3 stars instead of 2 but I am guessing they are just waiting to get their liquor license until they start charging exorbitant amounts of money for drinks The price is a sticking point with me because this summer when they were transforming the creperie to this new place I kept hearing how they were going to serve real french food with local ingredients for a more reasonable cost compared to the creperie This has really not panned out I loved the creperie and I thought the food and service matched the prices they charged This place not only has meh food but the service was also not as good first evening chaos maybe I will give them a second chance but it will be with reservation and they will have to excel to make me change my opinion 
3CII2Sc82TCdp6YlXLqeFQ Urbana This used to be a decent Indian restaurant but the last time I went mid summer the food was so greasy it was practically swimming I hope it was a one time thing because I m not inclined to go back especially now that South Indian food is available in Champaign 
3csMOXAC_wj9y3nsFkvJfg Urbana This place seemed to be the fun college hang out bar The place where the frat boys come to hang out and scan the ladies up and down I am not a frat boy I did not come here to hit on ladies I felt old here Though the bartender was nice and offered some suggestions to my friend on where he could meet some ladies to hook up with Mercifully I got to go back to the hotel and get myself to bed 
3D7cpqT0DrpCRAVBq5sp3A Urbana I agree with many of the criticisms listed by other reviewers chips not great some dishes can be bland etc but Fiesta is still my favorite Mexican place in CU I am a vegetarian and I love that they have such a good variety of dishes available without meat I particularly love the chimichangas I also am not a fan of refried beans so I love that Fiesta has the option of black beans for all their dishes It is definitely a comfort food type of restaurant for me cheap and cozy and consistent 
3Dvpmw8FRNu7mAtyShDgcA Urbana My girlfriend and I thought this place was pretty good Seeing that everyone was complaining about the prices and saying that it was overrated we came in with low expectations We only had sushi off the 1 menu and some how we ended up spending over 50 we ordered Nobilo wine and a few appetizers as well We enjoyed the sushi so much that we got a second order of sushi Being from California the prices of the sushi were really no surprise to us The place was pretty clean and the decor was very modern There was seating out side but my girlfriend and I still haven t acclimated to the humidity so we resorted to the indoor conditioning Overall a pretty cool trendy place to get a sushi fix if you need it 
3EoXaS1Lo4PWmFaIaSPHRA Urbana As good as a cheap and greasy breakfast gets Very friendly staff and it really feels like a neighborhood restaurant The breakfast special with coffee is a fantastic deal and the refills keep coming Better food than Merry Ann s in some ways since it is the same type of food but Sam s is only open during the day I ll hopefully get a chance to go back for dinner Overall this is one of the best of breed for greasy delicious breakfast food at low low prices 
3fVqJwreWFYzDz6r_zwEhw Urbana Service 5 stars food 2 stars atmosphere 2 stars Overall 2 5 stars 
3gD1EdYsfWnGq4aC5eVnQw Urbana Good burgers good beer Need more 
3GL6ComZwJR1pfNNtthNQQ Urbana After a disappointing visit to Murphy s on Wednesday evening for a burger I decided to try Legend s on my way out of town late Thursday afternoon I was not disappointed It s a bar bar food beer booths and stools The food is actually quite good This was probably my 3rd or 4th visit and it will now be my go to spot for a burger when I m in Champaign Did I say that the girls here were much much more attractive than over at Murphy s 
3GoqoHTJQIKY8M9aS4P_qg Urbana This is a truck parked at the corner of State and Bradley They usually set up on Fridays starting just before noon Things are little slow in the winter so they are irregular and you just have to see if they are set up I picked up 3 platters of ribs and tips a couple weeks ago for my family and we have been craving them ever since Tender juicy meat that falls off the bone nicely seasoned with sauce on the side The sauce is tomato based like something off the shelf but nothing I m familiar with probably customized a bit It s mild sweet sour tangy but not hot spicy I happen to like it a lot but I know others want more heat The ribs and tips platter is 8 and enough to serve 2 people or 1 very hungry person Comes with bread and chips These ribs are great and I can t stop thinking about getting more Just the smell is awesome In fact these guys have no signage the smell is what sells it I understand they also do catering You can find their number if you do some deep Googling but I ll leave it off here in case they don t want too many random calls 
3hgXz2oaUhxl0Bk7v41nGQ Urbana Pricey but amazing Everything I ve ever had there is top notch And when you re there for brunch you get bottomless MUFFINS And they re amazing muffins Try the pupusa if they still have it on the menu I think the menu changes a lot This place TROUNCES Radio Maria Trounces I can t believe more people don t go here I suppose it may be due to its location which is a bit lonely 
3IVxsS8mgqQyP99NhTP20Q Urbana Just discovered this place in the sport where Zyggyz used to be I ve only been there twice but I ve been impressed both times Being a vegan I ve ordered the Penang Curry w tofu twice and it has been ready in less than 10 minutes every time It is the best Penang curry you can get on Green St as far as I know the only thing missing is that it could use some more veggies like peas and carrots perhaps The spicy scale is between 1 6 and I like spicy food and a 5 works fine for me Big bottles of Sriracha are available if that s your thing For beverages they keep many pitchers of ice water ready for self service and as someone who likes to drink a lot of water with their meals this truly is a nice touch and I wish more places did this I hate having to wait to have someone refill my water and it s a lot easier to have a pitcher at your table if you are among a group or to just be able to stand up and refill your cup on your own As far a service I m going to second what most people have been saying very friendly service and always with a smile As stated previously the dish that I usually get comes out quick but the times I ve been there haven t been very busy Pricing is 8 10 dollars for an entree which might be a bit steep but the portions are adequate and not too filling Overall great Thai food and an excellent lunch option 
3IX2rHHZD0wDlZu6yencXQ Urbana I ve gotten takeout from this place twice now szechuan chicken dinner combo and I must say I have been impressed Not your typical greasy joint although it has the same menu as one the food was cooked to order with good quality chicken and veggies that still had a decent bit of crunch You can sub the egg roll for wonton soup for 85 cents so I did It was yummy and definitely hit the spot The only downside is that the dinner combos are just under 8 bucks which is a bit high but considering the quality I think this will move up in the it s late and I don t have any food at home rotation 
3j4OaMZypWylr7EuJ8IUNw Urbana Good food overall Offers a wide variety of dishes to pick from and all the vegetarian curries taste good I would rate it a zillion times better than the lame Basmati that it used to be earlier However i wouldnt recommend any dish that involves meat chicken lamb I auways end up finishing the whole dish leaving all the meat aside It feels like huge bland chunks of cisco meat that taste no better than rubber had been dumped into the gravy sauce curry that you ordered for and then served Now i stick to vegetarian food when ever i visit this place Note good cust service 
3JWwfZ2Wlz1Nw4qTFdxmiA Urbana I ll start with my negative feedback The service was very slow and the guacamole for appetizer was really bad They used way too much cumin I basically felt like I was eating straight cumin However the sangria is great although quite strong My favorite item was the main course I ordered the scallops and shrimp and thought it was wonderful Perfectly cooked and a lot of great flavors It s a little pricey but the main entree was worth it My husband had the pork tenderloin and thought it was great Skip the guacamole but get the scallops and shrimp dish 
3k0HVp_ntwg6khsLQYquFQ Urbana This is a real gem Probably the most consistently good food in CU Lunch brings nice grilled or deli type sandwiches and there are veg options Dinner is much more interesting with pastas nice fish and meat entree specials and wonderful thin crust pizzas baked in hot ovens Desserts are also very good I am less into fondue exceot for chocolate dessert fondue but this is the place to go for that The ambiance is eclectic and European Families will feel welcome Service can be a little ragged sometimes a student group of 15 or large party will materialize and that can have a rather deleterious effect on service when there are only 2 servers on the floor which is often the case at night Even so I have never had a meal here that was less than very good and many that were excellent 
3L7_YrqUjNI9ZmzD_kV3Cw Urbana I stopped into Esquire Lounge for a couple hours in the evening while waiting for the 7 59 PM Amtrak train back to Chicago This place is right across the street from the station I sat by myself at the bar but there were plenty of others riding solo as well It was THAT kind of place where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows Actually it was much more than that this place seems to have a little bit of everything There are pool tables in the back so you can get that sort of crowd There are larger tables as well so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away There are a good amount of TV s so there were some people watching the evening college football games There are decent sized booths so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops And there s a jukebox so some people are silently rocking out to the classics And perhaps best of all there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem Although he didn t get the words right I gave him an A for effort The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends and even the students are cool with the townies The beer selection was surprisingly good There were a lot of good import options available although I stuck with 2 25 Bud Light drafts Remember I was taking the Amtrak home so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend They have 1 50 PBR drafts too which is what the locals stuck to The food was pretty good as well I had a simple cheeseburger and fries Although not my favorite burger fries combo it was definitely worth the 4 50 I paid The fixin s table they have is nothing more than onions pickles and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces Nothing special there But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself I guess The charm of this place lies in the characters that visit and for that alone I am giving a 5 star rating The cheap food and beer is an added bonus And I almost forgot free peanuts If I return to Champaign any time soon I will definitely be back to this place 
3Lh0k2s5MWemzhIEbXrDuQ Urbana Update 6 20 I thought I d give the impasta another try We had a guest from out of town and thought we d go out rather than spend the night in the kitchen As we went to our seats we noticed an overabundance of drinking and little eating As we scooted into our booth the ladies next to us had to bowls of pasta that for lack of a better description looked dead They were lifeless unappealing and bland So we sat looked over the menu talked about drinks and wine and sat Twenty minutes later we decide to get up even though several people had looked our way No bread no water no hello nothing As we left we were stopped However too little too late We won t be back 
3LlFgFPTqXEHyEQRl951ww Urbana This is a strange place but it has its pleasures It is a cafeteria with extremely plain mid Midwestern offerings My take It is what it is Sometimes I want Midwestern cafeteria comfort food If I do it is OK to come here But if I m honest I can t tell you that this is a good restaurant Hence the two star rating Five funny things about it 1 It s male It is always full of scientists and engineers from the Beckman and CSL Perhaps for that reason it is one of the few establishments that I have entered on a busy day and noticed that of the 20 patrons there are zero women 2 It s university run Since it is run by the university a sign says that you can pay by university purchase order if you want to I have never seen anyone do this 3 The secret garden You can eat in a garden that almost no one uses or knows about to find it you must leave via the West door It is dedicated to women in science 4 The regulars Some people show up at the counter and are served without ordering I asked a staff member about this and she said He s been wanting the mac and cheese for thirteen years 5 The almost free salad I stuff as much into the container as I can and yet after it is weighed I am charged something like 82 cents Dressing extra Although it is a very plain salad bar Most of the food is actually prepared at a food service warehouse somewhere else I asked when I saw tortilla crusted tilapia with long grain wild rice and Kyoto mixed vegetables and the lemon mist cake Once you see the place you ll have a hard time imagining them preparing the tilapia and baking the cake from scratch in the back room and it turns out they don t But both dishes are OK Some of the offerings don t bother Cream based soups are a disgusting glop Some of the naming conventions on the menu make me smile with white sauce Ground beef steak a hamburger patty Some things Heck yeah Jambalaya is good The pot roast is good The hamburger ground beef steak is good I agree with Sarah H the pecan cranberry chicken salad is the big winner Delicious And the staff are delightful They ll loan you money They ll change the dishes around for you They ll sneak you extra food and not charge you for it if you are even a little nice to them You can check the menu online before you go http www beckman illinois edu cafe Note that they run out of their main dishes almost every day usually after about 90 minutes In sum It s a strange little cafeteria But it may be worth visiting at least once just to hang around a weird cafeteria full of weird scientists 
3LRTJwUcNGM2nqq87nl6-w Urbana Luna has excellent food I ve always had a good time every time I ve been Dinner is tapas and various entree s it changes regularly I ve only gone when I expect to spend a good deal of money but I ve always found it delicious I prefer to go for the chef s choice special when I can Less decisions for me and a wide variety of good tapas I ve also been for lunch its less pricy but still delicious I didn t expect to be wowed but I would say their lunch hamburger is the best in town
