2pUQd9pbBCm1bTZvcF9-Vg CMU CLOSED This place is gone 
2PwfA6NVfVCF2xDdwfAWlQ CMU I walked in here expecting to find another vintage store with marked up merchandise But I was pleasantly surprised to see a variety of cute things at very fair prices I think this store has a lot of potential like any vintage consignment shop sometimes you leave with nothing other times you leave with a lot They also have apparel for men According to their website they will buy clothes for 30 of the retail price in cash It s a nice option in addition to donating your stuff Overall I think it s a cute store reasonable prices Definitely worth dropping in from time to time 
2Q0rrAKuhQpOPkYLQc1SiA CMU Great Remodel Place looks fantastic Great Service Waitress was on her game and seemed to know the name of some of the people at the other tables Good food The Buffalo chicken salad was good and the honey buns are delicious My associate had eggs and bacon and said the eggs were perfect and you could tell they were fresh not out of a box Later our waitress confirmed that and went on to explain how they work with local farmers to make everything as fresh as possible The rolls from the bakery were fresh and good Enjoyed the coffee too For the price it can t be beat 
2qLS8_bNwnXdZAPBPr2WvA CMU Always a pleasure to eat in a Japanese owned sushi restaurant Ambience is bucolic weird description I know but the atmosphere was very calming Lots of thought goes into the presentation My friend ordered the blackened cod which was served on an expertly fashioned banana leaf 
2qtSXz-Y3TArXHB6CTEFaA CMU Today is Valentine s Day Or as men like to call it Extortion Day Jay Leno 5 Reasons Why I m in LOVE with Dave Andy s Birthday Cake Ice Cream cue cheesy love song 1 It was oh so delicious to the last lick Lick 2 It made me feel like a kid again o 3 It had itty bitty chunks of cake frosting and sprinkles mixed in Oh wee 4 Even during the dead of winter brr I still enjoyed it 5 Its been over a week since I first had it and I m still craving it Rawr Heavenly homemade ice cream can be devoured at Dave Andy s In addition to birthday cake I recommend cookies cream Straight up deliciousness Serendipitously found this little ice cream shop on Yelp decided to give it a try and boy am I glad we did It was fate It was love at first lick Swoooon 
2rIJ4m_JiLWtHZKhAJo1-w CMU Amazing food Really enjoyed the complexity of these dishes Very unique and the service was fantastic I ll definitely return here again 
2rq5ZDSRSWJ26cMb9PzlKg CMU Surprisingly good food for such an oddly uninviting storefront Pick up order was ready within 10 minutes of my phone call which involves silly levels of efficiency Squid salad wasn t so spicy but was really good Sliced ginger was a little strong but squid was actually tender Laos spearmint came with cubed chicken zucchini carrots broccoli standard veggies Not a very strongly flavored dish I didn t think I d ever use the word subtle for a takeout place but it s appropriate Avocado shake was like any other avocado shake except for a few ice chunks that hadn t been blended in all the way Really good for Pittsburgh extra points for being 2 blocks away and cheapish 
2S6J97DCyncmBdEj-XMNuw CMU The falafel was dry and not very crisp I got a falafel wrap and it was more salad iceberg lettuce and few tomatoes cucumbers than falafel I only counted 2 falafel balls Overall wasn t impressed and wouldn t go back unless desperate 
2sfdovJgU_cQCbfGOAeEBw CMU Wow this was good A group of 6 of us went last night showing up with our own case of beer We essentially ordered enough varied entrees for the table to create our own buffet I don t have a refined Indian food palate so I usually stick to the safe stuff BUT I will tell you the Chicken tika masala was one of the best that I ve ever had Plates were licked clean the sauce was so amazing The Vindaloo was also great we ordered it super spicy and it delivered Saag Paneer was better than most places as well very rich and delicious I really enjoyed that this was in an old house converted to a restaurant Many of the Indian places in pittsburgh don t pay much attention to ambiance or setting Tamarind gives it a little more attention apologies if I ve butchered the spelling of any Indian dishes 
2sMMj16R0mDYXZWn917KbA CMU Lulu s noodles is in an extremely convenient location for students coming from CMU so it should be no surprise that most weekdays around lunch time the place is packed The few times I have been there I have found the food to be okay nothing to write home about The Pho was utterly terrible and the various noodle dishes only passable The biggest problem though has been with the service You place your order at the counter and they are supposed to bring it to you Several times I ve found myself forgotten and having to go back to ask where my food is All in all it will do in a pinch if you re a CMU student otherwise steer clear 
2SpTiuAGViE1cXo4UaDcwQ CMU We got here pretty early so we managed to snag a table upstairs on the heated patio deck Service was pretty good considering they were fairly busy It seems like a fun place to hang out The scene was younger looking professionals or older looking students The food was not impressive The pizza was extremely greasy and lacking flavor The pizza rolls were really just egg rolls with peperoni and cheese which was disappointing since PGH typically excels at their specialties We also ordered the pierogis which were pretty good as far as this dish goes Drink prices were fair there was a lot of space and they had music It was pretty crowded by the time we left I would say this is a great place for drinking and meeting up with friends or strangers but I wouldn t suggest eating here 
2srFCtHwMrGmQvgvglUVxg CMU Apparently I will do anything for a well dressed salad Their salad is fantastic and so is the bread that comes with it However the first floor and bathrooms ALWAYS smell like sewage The last time I was there the ceiling was leaking and kept dripping on us and bc the restaurant was packed we had to demand to be moved to another table In fact this restaurant always feels straight up dirty The food is just alright but there are a few standout items like the omelette and the wedding soup 
2sVy8HRsYWgSaZYAmWlzzQ CMU Super duper into this place You only have to get as much or as little as you want The raspberry pomegranate and the honeydew are all great They have amazing toppings as well Love all the yummy fruit Wish they always had certain flavors though 
2T9u3ZqVPAqNInNzoVCmbg CMU A decent deli for Pittsburgh but this place is no match for other deli s around the country It will never be a Brent s LA They have a huge menu with very reasonable prices The staff is very friendly I started off with a bowl of matzo ball soup This was one of the worst bowls that I have every have 2 lumps of matzo balls in chicken broth There was no carrots noodles chicken or flavor I ordered the corned beef and latkes for dinner The latkes were excellent served with applesauce and sour cream The Noodle Kugel side that I ordered was OK but not great definitely didn t taste homemade The corned beef was very average and looked and tasted closer to grocery store quality than deli quality I saw some of the sandwiches that others ordered reuben vs rachel coleslaw instead of sauerkraut They looked very good Are there no bakeries in Pittsburgh They get their deserts from New York German Chocolate cake Carrot Cheesecake Key Lime Pie Coconut Cake and Red Velvet cake 
2TpXJcqf7ngYTm0TBRGdmw CMU Service 2 5 stars out of 5 Food 2 5 stars Price 4 stars easily under 10 person Atmosphere 1 stars unless you like shouting and being cold A number of people have said that this a great place for college students to get decent cheap food I completely concur My low marks come from the fact that I don t want food that is just decent or cheap I want it to be tasty and I m willing to pay for that Also it felt like a college cafeteria the stereo was loudly playing poppy dance hip hop and rock songs So I m getting a whole bunch of pop lyrics layered with everyone around me shouting over the music I could barely hear my wife right across the table There seemed to be a cool breeze blowing across my legs from somewhere Perhaps it was from the 8 inch hole in the wall behind us The food was greasy yet satisfying The white rice was a bit chewier than I like it At least the tea was tasty and stayed nice and hot 
2ubE0lsnvRAH0P91eNrkKw CMU Gene s was my favorite local bar when I lived in Oakland Mainly because I was broke and the drinks were cheap Is it still dollar Iron City drafts all day every day Good crowd full of regulars not just strictly Pitt students I d call it the Cheers of South Oakland 
2uKYrNvSbB1rsxwDbkvrfw CMU I went with an out of town friend for lunch and wish I had taken her elsewhere Our waitress looked half asleep and was not knowledgeable about the menu I got a Pizza Margherita and the center was actually soggy How did they mess that up My friend said her sandwich was good but neither of us took the leftovers home with us Meh 
2uU0emx-VgBKcykDZlxVOg CMU This is like being in a movie about a diner minus the fake quality Awesome people watching I recommend the fried green tomatoes and the hot brown These might be okay in the light of day Other things not so much 
2UXxwmiWryDVohr_rRZRPg CMU Great healthy and fresh food I highly recommend for lunch but sometimes the wait can be a little long Garden veggie goat cheese chicken and salads are a good bet A little more expensive than some chain restaurants for lunch but worth it 
2vb-yQxNqheNNf5RTprIuA CMU Once upon a time this place used to be great Like when they first opened It pretty much went downhill right around the time they started to branch out and open their other locations They couldn t make the cupcakes in the Murray Ave location anymore if I recall correctly so they began to outsource to their other location and as a result things just weren t fresh anymore I will miss being able to go here with my mum on our neighborhood walkabouts but only by a little bit They just lost it 
2vc__5mZ2auEaban26OHzg CMU Typical dinner place on the level of a good Applebees with great Margaritas 
2VgNk6xKxRWBOG439d1-XQ CMU I have been going to this GE for my whole life and believe me before they remodeled it it sucked much more Still there are problems For instance There are never enough employees working at one time I have NEVER seen all the lanes open For a market district that has a million lanes it s understandable to have 3 4 closed lanes when it is slow Fine The Squirrel Hill Eagle sees lane closings often leaving only 2 available not including self checkout Ah but when you do get to a register you can forget about the happy greeting or any greeting at all I have been told to hurry up by bad mouthed cashiers who want to go on break Thought there are a couple great managers for those that know Sarah who has been there forever but the rest are surly unkempt mean people The stock what stock Though their selection on nonperishable is usually fine you can forget about freshness anywhere but the deli nice group at the deli Fish is NOT I repeat not fresh Mold can be found on almost everything in the produce department I am meat connoisseur and even their top quality beef is a joke try Fillet Mignon that has the diameter of a silver dollar with heavy marbling The bakery is above average But damn is it convenient For many older adults and students without cars it is very hard to complain about much more It s there for good 
2vHRbe8yT_ScIdpKeZZ2Hw CMU I love me a tasty yogurt treat made just the way I like it I was disappointed with the loitering college students outside of this location however 
2vorMacViz0_Bf53nzBukA CMU So I ve given it a few more tries and there s no denying they make great espresso They re also very friendly The only thing holding me back from a higher rating is that I m not a fan of live music in coffee shops It s a bit intrusive and awkward however that s simply my opinion 
2xky7lSAo1AkpI2vrBYGOQ CMU Good storage units appears to be locally run decent all around I stored all of my stuff here for 2 months between apartments It was convenient that they re a uhaul rental location as well so when I moved out I just rented a uhaul from there and put everything in it on the spot However all the uhual trucks and the fact that they re on a hill can make the parking lot somewhat difficult to navigate Note that while they don t have great weekend hours once you have your storage unit you can get a passcode for 24 hour access to the building I moved everything in on Memorial Day when the office was closed but with the passcode it was no problem My only significant annoyance was in setting up my storage unit reservation I had to call several times to confirm and work out details and they often seemed very rushed on the phone Also note all storage units are paid on a monthly basis So I ended up paying for 3 months even though I only used 2 months and a week I think most places are like this just good to know going in 
2Y-GvAY3gKJJoDgAMSvsMg CMU We received good service and the food was good and consistent and the prices were reasonable Based on our experience with a few high end restaurants while in Pittsburgh this warrants 4 stars 
2YjlZbQBCYu5lCzsQCeQuA CMU I only stopped into the cute little shop for a quick gelato with a friend and I m glad that I did Its a very cute shop that offers food and gelato I tried the Mango Gelato and also the Salted Caramel Gelato and it was good I ll def revisit I d be very curious to try some of the tasty flat breads that were coming out of the kitchen area 
2ym-eeiBpKub6lmzdovd7Q CMU Nice selection of items good pricing and friendly atmosphere We ll be back 
2yr_PT9p_M1pZZmupRLwQQ CMU I was expecting a lot more from JT but realized that it is a restaurant that serves both chinese and korean but not in a fusion type of way It merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu The idea was cute They even have typical chinese lunch specials The deco needs upgrading and dusting some lighting or even natural light its like walking in a cave and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air I had a craving for comfort food and ordered Jajangmyeon and grilled calamari The tea and water was served as I sat down I went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people The calamari came out promptly and the Jajangmyeon took a little longer The portions were huge What took the longest and annoyed me the most I was the only one left at the restaurant was waiting for the check Why does waiting for the check take 45 minutes They never came the clear the table or walked by so that I could signal that I needed the check I should have just walked out The food was okay but I seriously needed to get in and out of there in a certain time frame that they didn t help with You may want to consider going when you have a 2 hour lunch break 
2ZV9nuYkoB2MXgHNxqk5hw CMU As you have read from all of the other reviews the service at Brasserie 33 stinks That s all you can really say Some say if you are looking for gourmet not service go here Seriously If I m spending the money on a roasted chicken I should get served in an appropriate amount of time I shouldn t have to wave down a water boy for a refill of water I shouldn t have to flag down a server just for my check our dinner plates were taken away 30 minutes prior no one asked if we wanted dessert The food Yes it s good The service will keep me from going back I can get better service at Denny s 
2Zvoz_89Xa1rwsE9wjA5Kw CMU I moved to Bloomfield in April and being Italian and loving Italian food I thought that Little Italy would be a good fit I was wrong Until tonight I have found that every Italian restaurant I ve tried has left much to be desired from Del s atrocious food to the over hyped Pleasure Bar I had not found an Italian joint I liked Lombardozzi I have not clue why I had not tried you until tonight I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal We started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection and no rubbery feel which is a positive because 99 of places outside the east coast can t to calamari to save their lives I had the gnocchi with red sauce only sauce option which kind of irks me because gnocchi is great with a pesto with meatballs The gnocchi is homemade and to die for and the sauce is pretty good too I m a sauce snob nobody beats my mothers or grandmothers and the meatballs were as good as I remembered Great food experience but the service was at best bad The waitress took over five minutes to get our drink order and just kind of seemed annoyed at the whole working thing I will be back because there is no Italian food in Bloomfield that even comes close to Lombardozzi 
2_Mssa9TjCxdS9MVleSLiA CMU Today was my third time eating something from Szmidt s and it keeps getting better From a plain turkey or tuna salad sandwich to what is probably the best chicken salad I ve ever had mango and feta everything is so fresh and delicious My husband has tried the Sanchez rage which is ridiculous but amazing and absolutely loved it The bread is to die for as well Fresh thick slices of homemade rye bread or homemade white rolls I m kind of concerned that this is literally at the end of my street I will probably be there way too often 
3-9KGPAv5BB-88dmcts1xQ CMU This is a great BYO spot with outdoor seating on Ellsworth The menu isn t very extensive but what they do have is very good and the prices are perfect Their lamb for the gyros and gyro salads is very flavorful and they give you a lot The service was a little slow but it was nice to not be interrupted constantly while eating It was a very relaxing meal and I will absolutely be going back I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were just a few more apps and or entrees to choose from It is definitely worth a try 
3-AkxDzgfA_xR41I0k7Xtg CMU Excellent lunch and desert crepes in a fun atmosphere Super tasty but a bit pricey and the place is usually quite crowded As long as you re not in a hurry this place is great Try a cappuccino with your lunch 
3-d70ebdrrTF_Blnybdy3Q CMU Do not go here if you are on a budget and or really hungry However if you have an expense account or are a guest of someone with an expense account as I was last night than this is a good option In fact this is the best sushi I ve had in Pittsburgh Umi is a part of the admirable big burrito group It s located above Soba It s up two long sets of stairs so if you are bringing someone handicapable or elderly they ll have trouble navigating the double staircases As I was walking up the stairs last night I noticed the painted large waves on the walls I believe Umi is japanese for big wave maybe Our reservation was for 6 30 and initially they only had the tatami tables where you sit on the ground and your feet dangle in a hole in the floor These tables are probably okay for date night but would have been weird with two business associates Luckily a table opened up If it s this busy on a Tuesday I suggest a reservations Anyways the rest of the space is very nice with a sushi bar with about 5 seats as soon as you enter and very warm colors with a few scuptures and a waterfall in the middle of the dining room The service was pretty good There was nothing particularly memorable I started with a Mark West Chardonnay which was okay and priced under 10 They also have a good selection of warm and cold sake I started with the white tuna sashimi which was a few slices of super fresh melt in your mouth tuna with a nice soy sauce and just the right amount of wasabi Matt tried the shrimp tempura which was perfectly breaded quickly fried light shrimp with veggies This was a good deal at 12 Keith had the lobster soup which had a few big chunks of lobster and a nice broth I ordered the toro tartar with caviar which was probably a teaspoon of super creamy fatty tuna and a touch of caviar This was really rich and one of the most expensive teaspoon serving I ve ever had at 21 for such a small amount Keith had some noodle dish which he said was good and actually was pretty reasonable but again it s noodles Matt ordered the strip steak tataki which was about 1 1 2 ounces of prime steak served with a sweet soy sauce It was delicious but again 20 for less than a 2 oz serving I stuck with sashimi The lobster sashimi was great and had some type of flavored sauce instead of just soy The salmon and tuna were also amazing They were cut perfectly and tasted like they were just pulled from the sea Overall a really good sashimi dinner however I have to admit I did stop for pizza a few hours later 
325t7hB5zAwRMbkRAE3qSg CMU I ll echo the finally good BBQ in Pittsburgh sentiment albeit with less experience hunting after the first few rave reviews I read on other places came up with disappointment Never again will I miss BBQ in this town Yinzburgh just does it right by the meat this is meat that tastes like meat and not like sauce You can tell they are cooking with love because the favors are all there and the staff is clearly proud of their product I m solidly hooked on the honey mustard sauce but all three are downright tasty Do yourself a favor and at least give them a try you won t regret it and I can bet you ll be as hooked as I am 
32GjJfEmo9IYikCoL_4hxA CMU Wasn t that hungry and was looking for a good places for alcohol and appetizers and stumbled upon Harris Fun times NICE Unique selection of beers I m no expert but I hadn t heard of 3 4 of them and the waiter recommended a tasty blueberry one Decent spicy mussels Not the best I ve ever had but be honest with yourself you re not going to find awesome seafood in Pittsburgh Wasn t rubbery at all and the sauce was nice Tasty perfectly sized bite sized cheeseburger appetizers Wings that weren t too greasy yet very flavorful We were there for bacon night Who would have thought eating strips of plain ol bacon would be good It is Nice patio Not too packed so you can talk yet busy enough that you feel like you re part of the action Friendly attentive helpful waiter WEIRD Took forever to get drinks and food My coworker said the wings weren t legit jerk chicken like advertised The patio was a little too romantic Meaning it was so dark I couldn t read the menu except by holding it up to the little candle at our table Ditto when we went inside for a bit Maybe that d be awesome if I was on a sexy date instead of with two coworker dudes I wasn t All in all I d come back if I was looking for a date place to have a light dinner or a place to chill with some close friends 
337YaOav-gpRyuoqNMPrKQ CMU I have been looking for a great place to get a pedicure around my neighborhood and this is my go to A couple of my friends and I popped in to get pedicures on a Saturday afternoon The wait was short and they were able to take all three of us at basically the same time It was a good pedi Long enough time spent on my nails as well as the massage and grooming They were not too invasive at all I did not flinch once and they did not dig into my skin or nails too much They removed enough excess skin cuticles and calluses but did not once make me uncomfortable in doing so The paint job was good and has lasted over 2 weeks already They were quick but not too quick And 25 is one of the better prices I have seen for what you get The atmosphere is a bit lacking Not a whole of magazines around or I think I just missed them as I was with friends The inside of the salon is generic and unconsidered in any spa type feel The service matches the decor generic and sufficient No one is going hand you a glass of water or anything like some salons do Accessibility is pretty good for me I can walk there from Friendship and there is also street parking on Center Do not try to park in the Panera lot One thing to remember is that though they take cards tips must be in cash so bring a few dollars Overall this is a great place for a regular pedi not a place to necessarily pamper yourself to the max 
344x0dQQGm8j-hP0x5OYsQ CMU Good burgers and mac cheese 
34zz_4mS152QUqDI3jy47w CMU Sandwich quality is equivalent to make it yourself at home except I could do it better Maybe I should have opted for one of the oven roasted but the regular sandwiches were overpriced The tomato bisque was good and would be the only reason I would ever return The service was less than helpful It s okay if you don t know the answer but it d be nice if they asked someone else instead of disregarding my question and giving me something I told them I didn t want Also if you re vegan the options are really limited to essentially soup or chili I was expecting a lot more variety since the logo and name imply a healthier alternative but like everything else it was a disappointment The price is equivalent to panera which is overpriced but the quality and service do not make up for such high prices Looks like I ll be sticking to Panera or even subway At least subway charges a decent price and actually offers more flavor 
36f9yNCsWB7-QUJoUiczqA CMU This is usually where we stay when visiting the niece in Pittsburgh because of it s convenient location to the university The rates are reasonable and they will often upgrade you to whatever the level is that includes a free continental breakfast Restaurant on site isn t worth the trip even though I was told on my recent visit there is a new chef I went into the restaurant just to check it out and looked over the menu Eh I also endured the buffet breakfast which is OK but nothing to rave about They have a cocktail bar where you can also order off the menu The bartenders seem like they re working in slow motion and you have to track someone down for a refill or to square up your bill The house wines are not worth your hard earned money stay away Valet parking is convenient and the valet staff is very affable and helpful Valet parking is 17 day ouch Rooms are clean nothing special and the beds are actually quite comfy If you re just looking for a decent place to lay you head down for a night or two this place meets the that need 
37dQoA_1pf-3JfxvxUyvVw CMU Mediocre food and tacky decor would be the most generous way of describing this place Convenience to Pitt may be the only thing this place has going for it and perhaps they re hoping that your average student isn t discerning enough to notice that everything else is lacking My chicken parmesan was dry and bland and it came with a side of heavily salted boiled or steamed vegetables summer squash and zucchini So heavily salted that I m retching a little thinking about them The waitress seated us under the air conditioner and when we asked to move because were so cold she commented on the fact that we weren t the first party she had to move as a result Why she couldn t have seated us elsewhere in the mostly empty restaurant is beyond me This place was a poor welcome to Italian food in Pittsburgh and I can only hope my next experience is better 
37KzgNPozbRpixRH9kUH3A CMU Service was incredible I ordered the hotcakes with strawberries that they re known for and a side of the lyonnaise potatoes to try them Those potatoes are delicious The hotcakes are very good as well Give them a try 
37WueYIeisAVl-jRI_LVXg CMU Our reservation was originally scheduled at 830 though we werent seated until nearly 930 i was an out of towner and felt no need to sugar coat how i felt about being made to wait on a leather couch for an hour after 2 glasses of Piscoe when we were seated our wait staff and the host profusely appologized for the wait they were very attentive thereafter and comped our first few rounds but i think it was because i pushed my boobs up mentioned that they should the food presentation was excellent and the taste was slightly above average the shrimp and grits were subpar the Frog was more fishy than i think was acceptable and covered in fava beans although we ordered no salads we were comped one of every one on the menu the duck was excellent as a main course i ordered the suckling pig the meat was tendor and well executed though i thought it looked more like mousakka i was really happy with the presentation i thought for sure i was going to be seeing a little Wilber or Babe on my plate after witnessing what the frog legs looked like Dessert was great im a big softy for creme brulee and they had their own version of tapioca creme brulee French press to cap off the night after all my free Piscoes was excellent All in all if we hadnt been comped so much i think our tab would have been close to 4 or 500 for the 3 of us our bill ran about 160 so i was content 
38pKA0FNdWix12Cr6LjJJg CMU I never appreciate people who use a Groupon right at the expiration date and expect great service at a fraction of true cost These are the same people who come into the grocery store at closing and expect the meat department to be open the people in line ahead of you who forget their prescription at the pharmacy and expect the intern to deal with it the people who scream when their salad has raisins instead of craisins In short these people want impeccable service at a price point lower than Supercuts I have been waxed in 3 states and 4 different cities I have been to upscale and working class salons I ve had my lip swollen an bruised by waxers before But I can say without hesitation that Ron is at the top of his profession Yes the shop is small The floors are worn But it s clean and well kept If I wanted to pay 50 for an eyebrow wax I would go to a ridiculous medi spa in Shadyside But I value affordability competence and quick service I don t need to be pampered I just need my hair but not all of it gone quickly and painlessly And that s what Ron s good at He makes minimal small talk he always hands a mirror over and says I ll be taking this off okay to ensure there are no misunderstandings If you re looking for a therapy session go elsewhere Or better yet take a long walk off a short pier But if you value precision and competence on your grooming this is your mecca 
38YM64TDEgh3jh_v-2GsyQ CMU Get a square pizza and a family of four can eat for days 
39Eae8MDotuvd-zvO2QhKw CMU This hotel has so much potential and looks like it was Staff very nice furnishings and decor very nice but you can see the building and mechanicals crumble in front of you 
39OnPB3xLzLU8Vd-ppW71A CMU its a alright place servers are wonderful but didn t quite enjoy the food 
3a4Arz49wCDwCSOf-Yz2Dw CMU Really great option for cantonese food in Oakland I ve never ordered from the buffet it doesn t look too good but they make an a ok congee no donuts unfortunately reasonably good roast duck pork and the fish maw soup is also very nice It s near my work and I like coming here for a late lunch when it s not crowded The interior is kind of beat drop ceiling battered furniture etc but I really like the laid back atmosphere This is my favorite place for a secret 90 minute leisurely lunch on a weekday with friends and sharing a few dishes Just arrive after 1pm 
3Alivwef_atDoRNZDhdYfw CMU If you like thin New York style pizza this is the place to go The slices are huge The dining area was clean and the people working there were friendly and helpful It was probably one of the best slices of pizza I ve gotten in Pittsburgh Believe me I ve eaten a lot of pizza 
3AmE8bFv2EEZPJ0D9ZRU0Q CMU I haven t eaten here since they moved locations but I am surprised at how many people rate this place as 5 stars Sure you can get a sushi roll for 4 but it has 15 micrograms of fish in it These were the smallest rolls I have ever seen anywhere Come on people I know Pittsburgh doesn t have much Asian cuisine but when you ve tasted the nectar of real sushi you ll realize how much this place doesn t compare Then update your review My friend and I were completely disappointed when we ate here Plus the service was horrible that night 
3aozkaXNQX4Cpbah3JqoTw CMU Out of my three day 3 state bar crawl this was my favorite bar Service was good the beer selection wasnt amazing but okay and they had shuffle board But what sold me was the Silky s had that homey feel to it 
3ASyX-fKAhHuOhT_IWRO_g CMU This place is a dump I guess if you really want to go to a hookah cafe and can t make it over to hookah bookah this has to be your only choice I think it s dirty and overpriced If you are coming into the city for a hookah lounge just do yourself and your group a favor and stay away from this one Take a ride down to E Carson and go to Hookah Bookah Much better 
3b2ebIafYE1c3DOXyFMtPg CMU Uncle Sams used to be a major part of my diet I lived right around the corner The subs are good but tend to induce comas and heart attacks The bread is nice and generally the ingredients are fresh The inside is clean and friendly The only real complaint I have is that most of the subs all taste the same maybe it s the shared grill which isn t bad just boring 
3BJfMSecJqtFuIQVrxnYfw CMU I was here today for lunch Our waitress was brand new and so we had to be a little patient but she was very friendly and will catch on quickly That said I have no complaints about the service but the food was not anything to write home about I ve eaten here a few times in the past and I recommend going with one of their top sellers noted on the menu they seem to be top sellers for a reason Deviating from those doesn t pay off But they do have outdoor seating and it is a great place for people watching 
3c1yP93FdZOh7SaNtwaZUA CMU One of my favs in pgh I usually get girasole salad with chicken but they have seasonal specials and it is just an awesome place 
3cL1VzM07QxyBKXRcxrITA CMU I ve never been to F F for the late night half price food but have been there a couple times for dinner and drinks The beer selection is awesome I personally love the fire baked brie which comes out nice and warm and has honey drizzled all over it When you cut the breading the cheese just melts out I m a big fan of the Porky s Revenge Pizza and the Filler Up pizza The burgers are decent and I usually get the sweet potato fries with them because they are so much better than regular fries Overall a good place to eat If you do want to go for half price late night special make sure you get there early because there is usually a line outside 
3CtYULgHhN-MXus_QoNA0A CMU Strolling around Pittsburgh for my first time every and this was the place I arrived at thanks for the recommendation fellow Yelpers The service was very friendly and attentive The manager owner was also extra nice The fried mozzarella with balsamic vinegar was an interesting touch I had never seen before The balsamic added a little more fun and flavor to what s normally a pretty standard dish The gnocchi with prosciutto and white wine sauce was very delicious but a little heavy for me The bread served before the appetizers was bland and uninteresting The olive oil had some peppers and spices in it that I didn t care for The atmosphere was very intimate and charming with dark lighting and small eating areas The paper table settings were kinda neat they weren t too casual 
3cyJd-Jc_JjFQTPiwRfseA CMU As a Greenfield resident and the grand daughter of a Philadelphia butcher I have to support this place The food is really good and the staff is super friendly I think the perogies are one of the best in Pittsburgh and the Fredo Goombah is my fave sandwich on the menu Everything is really fresh and they actually have a really good canned soda selection I m lucky to have them right down the street 
3c_6OguTwKChp_4j4mU_QQ CMU I feel like I have to say Every time I get a sandwich here now that I know to ignore the rotisserie chicken it is completely awesome We had a bit of a weird waitress last time we were there though 
3d4ih51RCg4_HVpA-RULdA CMU Good quality good price Not very spicy Cute waitress 
3D9KN_jX4LOomntxR7fqAw CMU This place is awesome They have a great beer selection the food is just right and the staff is super nice Definitely consider going to Hough s if you are in the area 
3dG09sT_-z5zNdSS5aLvzg CMU I have a hard time being in Oakland and not stopping at Dave and Andy s Their yogurts have a great texture and are allegedly 97 less fatty ha than the ice cream As long as they have a chocolate based yogurt flavor in stock I m a happy lady 
3dJqBRcMTKrzA9vVGqrxBA CMU Ahhh Waffallonia The stuff dreams are made of I had eagerly been awaiting the opening of Waffallonia for months as I had heard they would be serving liege style waffles Having seen several glowing reviews about them throughout several publications they were certainly hyped up quite a bit before I finally went I finally made it out for a mini Squirrel Hill Day aka Diabetes Day a trip that consisted of Rita s Waffallonia and bubble tea and indulged myself in some incredible Belgian dessert waffles Waffallonia certainly lived up to the hype Their waffles are slightly crispy on the outside as they have a caramelized exterior and a soft warm interior I got a waffle with Biscoff and whipped cream both of which slowly melted into the crevices and into my heart Seeing as this was the first time I d ever had Biscoff spread I was INSTANTLY HOOKED To this day I go to Waffallonia on a regular basis just to buy a jar of the stuff Only setback is that it s REALLY tiny with very few seats Then again I kind of find that sort of thing cozy and urban Don t worry the prices are decent and it never gets too crowded 
3DUAUUxe-fRdwYCcaHYMGA CMU Cute place Cute cupcakes Nice people However the vegan option is usually disappointing and plainly decorated I ve tried many different flavours of Dozen cupcakes at various functions but the only ones I really liked were the lemon Tiffany blue ones This is coming from someone who almost only eats chocolate desserts However none of the other cupcakes have blown my hair back I didn t like the Cosmo cupcake that some people seem to love Granted they look good but I found them to be dry and not very yummy 
3DVdzuc_9ccSQWUpio8Jqw CMU Four stars because this place is an institution Not just fries but a BAG of fries Be prepared to share with everyone you know and even someone you don t know The pizzas also aren t bad especially for the price but late at night be prepared to wait awhile while all the other drunken patrons are getting their own food Oh the store is not the best place to actually eat you food but just take it home and start that second party 
3eB_UFH1L02b2rDHczKq9A CMU Best brownies ever It was my office for months Don t bring your big group or loud b 
3EhTpK18c7G3f2CMYVQxDg CMU Gyros baba ganoush falafel baklava were all excellent Will definitely visit again 
3epA4He7OjHrHUIicI761w CMU What makes Qdoba better than Chipotle You can get queso on your burrito Seriously Chipotle why no queso That seems pretty standard to me Qdoba is just a chain and it s owned by McDonald s Despite both of these issues their burritos are just awesome Simply effing delicious And filling to boot 
3ePKD6-pUaLc1-F-_jkBdg CMU What a gorgeous place It s full of inspiration for the artist in all of us and I must have spent a solid four hours in there The butterfly room is beautiful and there are so many that it s not hard to find a few to take snapshots of I went with a friend and we were blown away by the Dale Chihuly pieces in there as well Overall a beautiful way to spend an afternoon 
3Er-IaRcV9BgDcqCwHCLOQ CMU BEST place i ve eaten in Pittsburgh in years The service was great try to sit near the back of the restaurant it s cozier The menu was local fresh and delicious i had a steak my husband had fish and chips and our other guest gluten free and vegetarian had a personally created dish that she loved the dessert was great except for that it slipped off of its pedestal as it was being served it was repaired and it was in the end a funny moment they do french press coffee for dessert a nice signature item i would eat here everyday if i could afford to do so definitely check it out 
3eTfDmHO2tpa58GHbIIU1w CMU I love this place mostly because it means I don t have to deal with the oversaturation of bars in the South Side The squirrel cage as some affectionately call it really is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh because it s a little dive y but still hip and has nice booths to sit in where you can just get a cheap pitcher or two and chill with your buds It s also great for people watching 
3e_Pp9StwyQ-WxujFiunwg CMU Thursday night Bites and Brews was buzzing with business My friends and I stood in the doorway shifting our weight uncertain of what to do No one had greeted us Do we seat ourselves we asked a waitress as she rushed past us Uh yeah she shot over her shoulder So we seated ourselves And then the same waitress came over to our table Can I get you something to drink Umm We paused Maybe a nanosecond too long Your options are on the chalkboard she spat and probably would have added idiots to that statement if she hadn t wanted a tip Oh uh She stared at us her eyes nervously glancing around the restaurant Something was up After a minute we ordered drinks and then took a look at the checklist menu a novel idea for a restaurant that is ostensibly DIY The drinks arrived We finished our checklists The waitress whisked the checklists away to the kitchen And that s when the minutes whisked away too Ten minutes Twenty minutes Thirty minutes Forty minutes A different waitress buzzed by us Then our waitress Then another one Suddenly there seemed to be eighteen waitresses in the restaurant We stopped one Where was our food She looked at us and her eyes shifted over to the kitchen There in front of the restaurant a waitress was hollering at a cook What do you mean you flipped it she screamed They ve been waiting forever The argument shifted locations to the front of the bar to doorway to the back kitchen then back to the floor It was a Battle Royale Our ersatz waitress glanced back at us Uh there s a bit of a problem in the kitchen tonight So she brought us another round of beer After an hour our food arrived It was okay Not great Certainly not wait for an hour great or even wait for an hour good at that But it was food And we were hungry And with the exception of our first round of drinks the entire bill was comped So Win win I guess 
3FjYs5JCeCvCSIZ2xJgQbw CMU Awesome place Small friendly super cheap and super big portions The appetizer eggplant is large enough to serve as a meal with some left over for tomorrow s lunch 
3FLszYxuXrxgGN34mdNElQ CMU I wish I could give it 4 and a half stars instead of just 4 But anyway This place has been around for a while now I am surprised it was able to stay in business considering how many other businesses have gone under on the same street The food is really really good It s Thai but also sort of Malaysian or something I am not 100 on that But it s definitely Thai and maybe something else There is a lot of seafood used in their dishes and same with fruit and spicy flavors Whoever came up with a lot of the appetizers really knows how to blend flavors together harmoniously To drink I always order either mango juice Thai Iced Tea or hot floral tea To eat my favorite dish is the Siam Paragon This is also my mom s favorite And I would like to point out that she does not even LIKE Thai food and she loves to eat here Their coconut rice is TO DIE FOR It s SO tasty and sweet almost like a dessert I ve also tried Haw Moork Fish Salmon Rolls Spring Rolls and the Spicy Siam Mussels on the half shell I am sure I ve tried a few other of their tapas too but it s been a while so the names aren t coming to me as I type this But basically it s all really good A lot of dishes have some spiciness to them so if you don t like spicy foods then you might wanna steer clear or play it safe and order something not so spicy like spring rolls or pad Thai I ve had their Red Curry with chicken and their chicken Pad Thai Both are really tasty The mildest level for the red curry is still a little bit spicy though The tapas are the best though and if you are undecided try the Siam Paragon and the Spring Rolls with chicken or veggies if you prefer Those are both tried true dishes I ve never really tried their alcoholic drinks so I can t comment on those or the desserts I REALLY love their interior too Easily one of the most romantic interiors in town or at least in the Sq Hill area The lighting decor and the waterfall by the door all very nice for a night out Regarding the prices pretty affordable if you order 3 4 appetizers and split among you and one other person or more My mom and I spent about 35 total for the both of us including a tip for our meal and we were pretty filled two mango juices coconut rice side order siam paragon mussels on the half shell spring rolls and salmon rolls The only reason why the Silk Elephant did not get 5 5 stars is due to the service It can be really really REALLY slow in there sometimes even when there aren t many other people eating there Once you place your order it seems to speed up a bit though 
3fvlOaVNHerW1qPJEs5QdA CMU What was supposed to be Pad Thai ended up being some bland noodles drowned in a big mess of bean sprouts and tofu and may be oyser sauce Fishy more chum than Pad Thai Chicken Noodle dish was mushy and reeked of rancidity and fish stock as well Food order came in after no more than 2 minutes of placing the order I really was wondering if he mixed our order with someone else s Anyway gave the usual tip because waitress was pleasent but not going back 
3fYbpoKNY5Oet5azQVQeEg CMU Pros free unlimited wifi now Very long spacious lots of lighting a fireplace Lots of seating lots of outlets a large garage door that opens to the street for people watching and a breeze A room that can be reserved for group gatherings the Japanese barista makes ridiculously delicious lattes with adorable latte art Cons Drip coffee is super watered down The other baristas aren t nearly as good as the Japanese man The bathrooms are constantly disgusting and reek of piss It looks like they only clean it maybe once every 2 3 days at best Definitely will continue frequenting this location since it s so great for getting a lot of work done but damn those bathrooms 
3GbUSh3vWJtzJu9FDwB1Vw CMU Totally delicious Ditto everyone who has mentioned the waffle cones they are heavenly I had the cookie dough ice cream which has chunks the size of a small country 
3GUi-Y8YmMHoBpqjQ4NCYQ CMU We went tonight with our 2 year old daughter and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner We shared the appetizer sampler and the dips were fresh with great pita We also ordered a small Greek salad which was large enough to share with a tasty fresh cheese and a nice light vinaigrette Right now there aren t many entrees but my wife ordered the traditional shish kabob and I had the chicken kabob platters These came with more salad on the side and were also good For dessert we tried the pistachio wrap which was warm and delicious They also added a new rice pudding which was wonderful with a nice hint of citrus and just the right amount of cinnamon The service was friendly and attentive and they were clearly happy to have a young toddler We noticed a steady stream of take out traffic as well We will definitely go back again 
3gv9LKjWMZbRJZIeGisFrg CMU They changed the menu up a lot recently taking some of my favorites off of it though they claim that I can still get it by ordering the specific ingredients It s not the same Downstairs has normal tables upstairs is a bar they claim the downstairs is open til 9pm every day but they usually close it by 7 Upstairs you can order off the menu til 11 and it s 21 after 10 They have pool and darts but it s not great for atmosphere 
3gY5aBnd3eYZU4RLojXhZQ CMU I was looking forward to visiting Legume because of its great reviews but was really underwhelmed For starters my friend and I the crudite appetizer The selection of vegetables was interesting but for the amount that were on the plate more of the dipping sauce would have been nice I was surprise by ALL OF THE LAMB on the menu but visited the website once I was back home and realized that there s a relationship with a butcher that involves lamb Still three lamb entrees while there s no chicken and other obvious proteins is a little weird Also the lamb was not prepared that well What was really disappointing though were the two dead fruit flies in my Four Roses The waiter actually returned to the table after taking my drink back to the bar to ask me if I still wanted the Four Roses why was there something wrong with it They brought a replacement but I was surprised I wasn t comped for the drink Also by definition this place is not a bistro but whatever I really wanted to like this place With the exception of the drink containing dead bugs the wait staff was great and I did think they had a nice selection of wines 
3H0WWG7eKDtyX232KFQm9w CMU Ok I know what people are going to say How could you give The Porch only 3 stars Went here for brunch today and the meal had two sides the really good and the bad What we sampled Farm Bread with honey butter apple butter and blueberry preserves Today s farm bread was homemade english muffins and the order came with 2 whole english muffins The muffins were delicious especially enhanced with the different butters and preserves Bianca Pizza Fig Jam Goat Cheese Mozzarella Arugula Truffle oil This was my order and I was pretty disappointed I love all of the things that this pizza promised but I don t think that it delivered Overall the pizza had way to much fig jam and the taste was overwhelming and I wasn t able to taste the other flavors Burger Roasted Red Peppers Caramelizied Onions and a Fried Egg on a Brioche Bun This burger was awesome The burger was cooked rare though we requested medium rare but it was so good it didn t matter Also the egg was perfectly cooked This was messy and delicious in all the right ways Cast iron pork belly Possibly the most disappointing dish of all It was a small cast iron skillet with 10 small chunks of pork belly that were so overcooked they were almost impossible to eat I would probably return for dinner to see what they are able to do but I don t know about brunch The service was good and our waitress fulfilled every request that we had The place was bustling with small and large groups and the noise level was moderate I also liked the decor and the towels for napkins 
3h8xSndUf9lwggWXAt9Jug CMU Doc s is a decent place in the Spring and Summer when their 2nd floor upstairs patio is open They have reasonably priced pitchers of beer and well drinks It s nice to sit outside and relax after a long day of school or work The beer selection isn t that great and the upstairs bar is not full Sometimes their drink specials are served in tiny plastic cups The service can also be rather slow I am not a big fan of their food pizzas are bland and the burgers overcooked although it is nice to split an appetizer with a group of people 
3HfJA3eImZa-48BVFYN-WA CMU I am really lucky to have Phantom of the Attic as my LCS i e local comic shop as it is less than a block from where I work On my breaks insert laughter here I wander into PotA and get lost in the displays One thing I am really impressed with is the layout and feel of the space It is modern and clean unlike even the best comic shops I ve been to and the displays are set up really well making it easy to look at their offerings You ll find a wide array of current and back issues as well as omnibus collections graphic novels books posters movies some toys tee shirts and more Being the serious Star Wars and Doctor Who fan that I am I am usually sad to see that there aren t a lot of figures representing these two franchises but we can t all be pleased However what is pleasing is the staff of PotA who are friendly and very willing to help and answer any questions you might have Some good things to know in general Parking is on the street and depending on the time of day or day of the week may be hard to come by Don t be thwarted from your quarry look down one of the smaller streets just off of Craig for a spot but be sure to mind the signs as parking authorities are heavy in the area 
3HYelLNiRYkGOyMlr41B2g CMU I used to be a regular at Harris Grill until I moved a bit further away but I still try to return for the I Can Haz Bacon Cheesburger and Bacon night Where else can you go on a Tuesday and order a side of bacon with your meal While Harris isn t the only place in Pittsburgh where you can get your drinks delivered to you by a cute hipster waitstaff it certainly has one of the widest best beer selections in the city I ve also heard tell that the frozen cosmos are quite good 
3IFiQt5xjSfFmtmz86B9Gg CMU A Shadyside staple this place is great for lunch while shopping Walnut dinner or late night Last night my friends and I stopped here and it was at it s usual capacity upstairs and downstairs with decent music playing It s a good local bar nothing too crazy going on and good for a final stop before heading home 
3iH3II21ouXaTQaDN1dT0w CMU For my 100th review I m taking it back home Girasole is a lovely little italian restaurant tucked away in a basement on Copeland Street They have outdoor seating that is secluded from all the hustle and bustle on Walnut Street so it s definitely ideal for a date in the summer Our service was wonderful and the waitstaff was incredibly attentive My friend and I split a bottle of chianti and started off with some delicious escarole and beans The escarole was still slightly al dente and was swimming in a pool of beans with garlicy plump fresh tomatoes We asked for extra bread twice to sop up all of the juicy goodness We also split the bruschetta which came styled with ricotta cheese It was also delicious I picked the spinach and ricotta ravioli which were large little pillows of warm goodness I think there were only 4 but they were huge and also swimming in another delicious sauce The herbs were so fresh and delightful in this dish Everything at Girasole is rustic and bursting with flavor Anytime I m home I come back for an enjoyable meal in the sun Classic Italian food 
3IIZxw-PS7fqkRPAq4qX1A CMU The boy and I were visiting his brother and sister in law who have recently moved to Pittsburg During our day long visit to the Carnegie Museums we decided to stop and have lunch here rather than wander the city looking for food The boy had the steak sandwich which he said was a little greasy but yummy I had the petite salad and mushroom soup it came with a cute little bread bun The salad was prettily presented but the carrot curlicues were very challenging to eat gracefully The soup was very good and the combo only cost 5 We sat by the window which presented a nice view of the fountain and the street 
3iNM5vT33PhjmXC7jglusw CMU Not sure what is it about this location but it s small the people that work here are super unfriendly and the service here is horrible I came here shopping with my bf s little sisters and I wanted a volumizing mascara that would give me a fake lash look When I asked the woman at the counter she looked at me as if I were crazy and had no idea what I was talking about Then she brought me a mascara expert who also looked at me with confusion The awkwardness continued as she told me about 3 favorite mascaras and when I said great thanks she stood there a little too close to me then asked well uh u don t need me to put it on for you right in a somewhat condescending rude and supremely awkward way I m like what is going on here Sephora twilight zone When I finally have the opportunity to try the mascaras on myself another employee was standing a few feet away watching me like a hawk I saw her just staring at me out of the corner of my eye I guess it s fine to watch your customers but perhaps she could have been a little more discrete Finally I settled on a mascara sampler kit but the one I was given had a broken seal When I went to pay for my item I asked the sales associate if I could have a new unopened kit She also looked at me as if she didn t know what I was talking about When I explained that the seal was broken and showed her that she very rudely scoffed well sometimes the seals bend over I kindly asked her if she would please look to see if there was another one that didn t have a broken seal It s your job to help the customer She looked so angry having to go and check I almost wanted to just leave and I really would have if the kit weren t such a great deal that is where the 2 stars comes from When she finally came back and I paid for the item she refused to look at me I paid and got out of there as quickly as I could Please don t spend your money at the Shadyside Sephora 
3IujN2K4EedrfFUJ_dWPcQ CMU I can understand why some people might love this place but it just wasn t for me I had a Groupon and decided to try it out for dinner on a Friday night with the boyfriend I made a reservation but the restaurant wasn t crowded at all The menu was simple with a lot of delicious sounding dishes none of which were vegetarian The pasta of the day was a seafood pasta so that wouldn t work either I asked the waiter what he recommended thinking he might be able to work something out with the pasta but no such luck He suggested soup a salad and a vegetable We both ordered the special soup potato leek a salad with goat cheese and a side of asparagus and green beans I had a 10 glass of Malbec which was pretty decent We started off with some crostinis and butter followed by the soup which was delicious Our salad and vegetables came out next Everything was done very well especially the goat cheese which came baked on bread with the salad The service was just okay Our waiter was super attentive at first then we didn t see him at all after he took our order Our food was brought out by 2 different people our water filled by another and still another brought our check over Nobody came by to see how our meal was or ask if we needed anything I probably won t return given the limited menu options for myself The bar area looked nice so maybe I ll stop in for a glass of wine in the future 
3Iz0TOvR1HTa9iCfr7gVQQ CMU Us lucky Carnegie Mellon students could get into this museum for free sooo I managed to make it here once a year Looking back I probably should have gone way more The architecture of the building is so open airy and bright I love the layout and the gigantic staircase up to the galleries My favorite part the gigantic room with all the dinosaur skeletons and the last room in the art galleries with the modern art there s a really neat blue painting with concentric circles which tricks your eyes into thinking it s breathing crazy 
3j-bT_0Us5t7fE_68iFDAQ CMU Four words bring me to Gullifty s Kenny Blake improv night Kenny will jam for a bit on sax with the band then invite whoever brought an instrument to join in Any jazz night in Pittsburgh will have high standards due to the city s rich history in the genre and Kenny never disappoints It s always an interesting experience As far as food goes the cobb salad has been consistently good and all of the fried appetizers are as good as any diner s I don t eat sweets often so I can t speak for the so called famous desserts Others have complained about the decor but I find the hideousness of it somehow charming 
3j4UQBduNU7jXvBCJoK5rQ CMU I ve noticed this place while driving to the South Side via Greenfield Ave One evening the boyfriend and I were looking for a bite to eat but neither of could decide where to go On a whim I pulled up to Szmidt s and man I m glad I did The aroma of all the spices and fresh bread when you walk in the door is intensely pleasing The deli case is filled with various fresh pasta salads and sides that include grape leaves pickled cucumber slices mac n cheese with jalapeno apricot glazed meatloaf potato salad tuna salad haluski looked amazing I will definitely be back to try it and various other items that evade my memory at the moment Have I mentioned that everything is made in house Breads salads sides and pierogies ALL home made Speaking of pierogies all your classics are here Potato cheddar potato kraut potato jalapeno sausage and plain kraut 4 95 6 8 95 12 In addition to these are New World Pierogies 5 45 6 9 95 12 Reuben thanksgiving with turkey gravy southwest chicken with cilantro lime sour cream buffalo chicken with bleu cheese cheese steak with horseradish sour cream and bacon cheeseburger with rage sauce They also offer sweet pierogies like apple mango granny smith apple pie and a seasonal special So much deliciousness in one place we didn t know where to begin After thinking long and hard I finally decided on a spinach feta doughbie think stromboli and Justin opted for the Frankie sliced turkey breast ginger mustard glazed ham maplewood bacon american cheese mayo lettuce and tomato all on a toasted homemade bun While our food was being prepared we chatted with the owner I told him we ve been living here for a year now and can t believe we never heard of his place then he informed us that they just opened up a month ago and offered us some samples from the deli case We had a little scoop of potato salad better than my mom s sorry ma 4 grape leaves the best I ve had and I do love me some dolmas sweet cucumber slices JB was a huge fan and now wants me to try my hand at recreating them at home so he can have them all the time and ziti pasta salad which is great WITH the cuke slices Everything we had was exquisite The entire experience was pleasurable The shop owner was personable and inviting the shop is darling and homey with pictures of the family hung on the walls and the food is delectable and very affordable Sorry for such a lengthy review but I just can t say enough good things about Szmidt s If you happen to find yourself in the Greenfield Squirrel Hill area do yourself a favor and give this place a chance 
3JswcgV_MZg--az3bTo7Fw CMU Best sushi I ve had in Pittsburgh The white tuna was great The portions are very small so we kept ordering more and more dishes as we ate 
3kBfvZKxuVKRF68CFUTthg CMU My husband and I adore this place Despite having been incredible fans of Dozen we had them cater our wedding brunches we never went to their Squirrel Hill location But then we discovered Waffalonia and go pretty much once a week It is the perfect opportunity to go on a short walk and eat some absolutely delicious waffles I actually don t mind the seating I don t think the store owners really intend for the restaurant to be a place where you hang out indefinitely with your friends Could it be that Sure But by depriving you of proper seating options which btw I can t say has ever bothered me my husband and I hang out in there with no problems whatsoever they make you focus on what s important and that is how freaking delicious their offerings are My husband and I talk until we get the waffles and then there s just silent munching and mooning over the waffles until they are all gone And then we start talking again usually about how awesome the waffles are and how glad we are that there s a place like this in Squirrel Hill Just as a funny side note for those of us who grew up in the 80s try to think of the Animaniacs song but with Waffalonia instead 
3kITHcAISh6qLUGuz-NXuA CMU I really like this place Its owned by a husband and wife They both do an excellent job I recommend going doing the week bc I think its just the two of them and it can get busy 
3KMsvJmgdI9ZY3aIu5CA0A CMU This is a cute place to stop to grab a bite to eat We ate here for a tiny snack after our Phipps flower trip so I cannot fully rate the place because all we got was a Hummus wrap and a green been salad However they were both delicious I loved my green beans There were onions and cranberries within the green bean salad which added a very delicious part to the plate The atmosphere of this place is also fantastic It is very trendy and clean One can see the cleanness based off the fact there is 5 different kinds of cans for garbage Very cool and very trendy I wish more places were like this I want to come back here and actually have a real lunch so I can actually have a good opinion but based on what I experienced I would definitely come back 
3l2gBOvvjUr-F-z-N2Z3Fg CMU I ve never been to the one in Oakland But there IS one in the Southside which is great The space is open and has really clean lines The staff is always super nice I just had my birthday dinner there a couple of weeks ago The fact that it is BYOB is fantastic too Jamesons and wine woo I am a big fan of Middle Eastern food The gyro yee rro meat doesn t seem processed and isn t greasy like most places Yes roll those r s rrr The dish that keeps me coming back is the hummus madamas The chick peas are whole with lemon juice olive oil cilantro i think tomatoes etc Healthy and refreshing dish The platters are great especially the kebabs and cuts of lamb The lamb is always cooked really well with absolute tenderness I m not a big fan of the chicken though I remember it being a tad dry Considering I was down six shots of irish whiskey and four ipa s I can t recall too well It s a great environment for large groups or even an initmate date 
3Lie0rrPAx0RvCpEx9oh0w CMU I love this place because it is consistently a 5 star restaurant Every time you walk through the door you know that you will be having an absolutely superb meal The servers are perfectly attentive without being overbearing They re knowledgeable friendly and pleasantly enthusiastic The food is always fresh well matched flavors and they love to use simple ingredients that create a well balanced course Did I mention their dessert is absolutely to die for Oh coffee too I cannot wait to try the spring menu I ll definitely be bringing a nice bottle of wine and relaxing for awhile 
3M5-gdFyiSGuqSuSCxRf4A CMU I m not sure what I was expecting but I was expecting something other than what it was I guess this is Pittsburgh s equivalent to the Buffalo Exchange They had awesome options for Halloween Like tons and tons of clothing for Halloween costumes They also had a great selection of jackets But it was just sooo crowded on the day I went And also the prices were a bit meh for second hand Like a scarf 12 A scarf that can probably be bought from a street vendor for 5 I was able to find a lovely lace dress a boyfriend cardigan and sheath dress though And the damage was around 50 So not bad 
3n-0DB0jA6T4qUL-bCo7tw CMU Another one of my favorite escape from Pittsburgh locations This small Thai restaurant off the beaten path of Forbes Ave and looking pretty ghetto from the outside is one of the coolest places for dinner in whole city If you like tea and I do they have an entirely separate tea menu with a fairly large collection Also you can never ever ever go wrong with the Ice Tea of the Day So awesome Almost all the food is good here however my favorites were the singapore night noodles the pad thai i know and my all time winner the chicken with string bean which actually comes with more than one string bean As mentioned this place is BYOW and many people do You get an eclectic crowd of college students professors and other academic types mixed in with some curious locals It s all pretty affordable too 
3n1FQU5hcie08KXyP7JHJA CMU Noodles Company is a chain restaurant yes but as far as I m concerned it s a welcome addition to the available array of Oakland eateries It s kind of like Chipotle for noodles you pick from a menu that has menu noodle dishes that fall into American Asian or Mediterranean categories I have tried a couple different things here and so far everything has been pretty good The Penne Rosa is definitely my favorite The only downside is that the restaurant is ALWAYS packed and pretty loud but things move quickly even so If you re in Oakland and feel like you ve tried everything around stop here You won t be sorry 
3NAqabPCZ67Tt9Q8azdh7w CMU This place is fantastic The owner greeted us as we walked in as did several other patrons this was our first visit and they made us feel like regulars It s a small place but the easy sense of community prevents one from feeling cramped The owner asked us for feedback as we ate rather than how do you like it which I appreciated And my feedback was this is delicious Can I move in I would gladly live in their basement if I could smell that pastrami every day I had their version of a Reuben housemade everything even the bread Excellent decision on my part My fianc had their Szmidt sandwich to which he added a fried egg This is an option on any of their sandwiches They ll also make you any combination sandwich you like Their pierogies are very popular and I cursed myself for having eaten breakfast hours earlier as that bowl of cereal prevented me from being able to order some of their dessert pierogies So go to Szmidt s I ll see you there 
3NfxR-Gq4AmtYrpG2seE7g CMU Nom Nom Nom Nom This place is delightful As a hardcore Thai fan I frequently shun Chinese food Mostly because I feel the bland ameri chinese is greasy and unsatisfying This place however blew me away with their authentic Sichuan food Who knew Chinese food was this good Damn those restaurants that try to placate the American palate The millions of dried red chillies that were scattered through a pan of flaming fish calling to me with their flavorful spicy and tender meat that had layers and layers of flavor This place is just around the corner from us so we ll definitely be keeping it as a go to Tip You ll have to ask for the Sichuan menu they won t automatically give it to you Also the servers will give you plenty of tips on what is good and what are the most popular dishes that people order 
3Nhj2XcR1OJCnN9aPIY3HA CMU Ahh PHI bar my bar A true dive bar with a mix of locals and CMU kids slumming it together and sometimes to hilarious effects The beer is cheap the pizza greasy and the fries crunchy I love the specials such as 4 Yuengling pitchers on Thurs and 6 Blue Moon pitchers on Wednesday The pints aren t too expensive either especially the Yuengling The bar tenders can seem a bit cold until you start chatting them up and then they give you all sorts of under the counter specials Be wary of Friday nights which is 1 well drinks and the place resembles the black hole of Calcutta with beggars traded out for frat boys in polos and flip flops The minimum for credit cards is 10 but there is an ATM around the corner so never fear and I always order more than that anyway 
3NLzZTxqeB10lL5ZWd4qWQ CMU Well my update has half of my original rating Not because of their food but because of the service My friend booked her birthday party there this past Saturday night in their tavern room When we got there the room that was supposed to be set up for her party and guests was completely full of other restaurant patrons She had called in advance to confirm party details and they assured her that everything would be fine Not the case when we got there The person she set the party up with wasn t working that night and it took the hostess 15 minutes to find his note that was left about the party It took another hour for them to clear somewhat of an area for the party which was now squeezed into the bar area The whole area never fully got cleared out for her party and we had to share space with people who they had sat in that hour that we had waited for it to clear out They also put only one server on staff which was insanity and chaos because there were 30 of us at this party I think she got 1 out of every 4 drink orders correct I would still go here to eat for dinner but I would never recommend it to anyone looking to have a party or event here 
3oAQpVb-DqAWe4gpFob9cw CMU Do you want to be shitface drunk off of one drink and you only have 10 go to Mardis Gras Their drinks are military grade weapons that is how strong they are This bar is unlike every other bar in shadyside it s dark and it has cool round booths the bartender should be a national treasure he is awesome bring cash you can t use your card there Oh you will smell like smoke when you leave this place is full of smoke It s likely the least sexy bar in all of pgh but its one of my favorites 
3OCqp1Bo7UoiL_dhnKMqBQ CMU I ve had some of the best loose leaf tea here I ve had mixed luck with the food one dinner was excellent whereas a lunch seemed too salty Definitely better to eat here rather than take out as I think the take out suffers For what it s worth they do have beer and wine I m not super excited about this place but I would probably go back if others wanted to go i e I doubt if I would choose it myself again 
3OXEm-fPpZ4DQ9dwgRyG6g CMU You only come here for one reason the 5 large cheese pizza It s carry out only and anyone who lives within a 4 block radius of this place knows all about this The pizza isn t that great but if it s midnight you re piss drunk and need some food this is where you come 
3Oyt3E1BWDIO0-eEV8od0A CMU Shaved ice is one of my favorite Taiwanese treats but unlike bubble tea or Taiwanese savory snacks or dim sum it s harder to to find in the U S Stores that focus on shaved ice are rare even in cities like NYC and LA This is why I m thrilled that a shaved ice place opened up within walking distance to my home But first let me back up a step here Shaved ice is basically a plate of finely grated ice with syrups condensed milk and additional toppings such as sweet red beans fruit etc It s like a more fanciful snow cone for a more international take on the same basic concept see http www nytimes com 2010 06 16 dining 16ice html pagewanted all What I liked about the newly opened Cool Ice Taipei they make a satisfying plate of snow ice that is their machine produces ice shavings with a finer fluffier texture than what you get from a coarse hard snow cone CIT offers several flavored ice base milk matcha Japanese green tea or fruit The toppings are sweet but not overly so I wish that the menu were a bit broader for example it d be nice if they d let customers pick their own toppings rather than offering just eight standard sets most of the standard sets have just one or two toppings I also wish that the prices were lower an albeit large plate will run you between 6 50 8 50 CIT also offers a variety of tea drinks and some savory Taiwanese dishes I ve not yet had the chance to try but they ve at least piqued my interest In terms of its space the store could have used a bit more remodeling rather than just inherit everything from Pamela s The vibe feels a bit off In that respect CIT could have taken a pointer or two from its neighbor Rose Tea Cafe Overall CIT did not disappoint They may have a few more wrinkles to work out in the interim I hope they succeed 
3oZQyluDNKqQL6wwZSYHyw CMU Classy place low lighting and candlelit white clothed tables I got the crispy spelt dish I asked for no cheese which was this layered entree of savory spelt crackers and sauteed greens every component was delicious and the dish overall was a good balanced of flavor and texture and seasoned well Sticking to the veg dishes about 15 makes this restaurant a very deliciously affordable upscale experience Highly recommended 
3p37CToxlfadSTt5-sSBqA CMU Delicious green tea latte and tea mulled apple cider Cozy atmosphere generally quiet would recommend for reading or studying and enjoying good tea 
3pf1Ng-yGWj2bxM2cbf9IQ CMU This is a pretty good quality Indian I didn t have the buffet but I ordered off the menu I had the lamb vindaloo with an onion kulcha the vindaloo was spicy and sour as I expected 
3PxgDmqZgcDxXkfRrHzLrQ CMU Tokyo is a great place to get some hard to find japanese ingredients The bento boxes are delicious and inexpensive Store is clean and the workers are very friendly They have a good selection of things that are difficult to find in the city like yuzu and ginko nuts and fresh shiso leaves lotus root etc They also have a good supply of sushi grade fish gindara kimche and other picked items like plums Very good it also happens to be right across the street from Umi which I can also say has excellent sit down food Try the omekasi you wont be dissapointed 
3QETU8ow3V3leHa4feoHuw CMU Don t be deceived by the nondescript PAMELA S RESTAURANT sign in the sketchy font out front The interior of this place is cozily modern and the food is fantastic Home fries cooked to a mealy perfection then smashed before frying in order to maximize their crisp able surface area They must put some kind of cheese in them to get it that lovely golden brown color and perfectly crunchy texture Hotcakes kind of like a thick crepe but better Each bite is different sometimes sweet sometimes a little saltier fruitier other times crunchier Delicious every single time Omelettes Their egg white omelettes do a great job posing as normal eggs The fillings are fresh and flavorful without overpowering the flavor of the egg Toast Yes even their toast is excellent Crisp on the outside soft and fluffy on the inside And their toast comes pre buttered taking care of that pesky cold butter on hard toast problem It s greasy spoon brunch fare at its very best My parents ate here two days in a row which says a lot because they re Asians from Asia and typically don t like greasy American style brunch foods I m an Asian from America and typically don t like to agree with my parents but I ll make an exception for Pamela s This place is amazing 
3Qoe--earCdwz5gm92bUpA CMU I m a Starbucks fan I must say I LOVE the S S location as well as this one The folks who work here every time have greeted me with a big smile They are patient as I am very quiet in the AM and usually need to repeat myself Within one week they picked up on my drink and make it just as I like There is one employee who got my drink wrong however I have seen them strive in the month since my switch from S S to Bloomfield I may be getting the wrong impression but I feel like they work well as a team ever with a struggling player I will continue to happily go there There s something to be said about the location too The cleanliness is on point and the high ceilings are very attractive And can we talk about how they re by the devilish Paddy Cakes Enjoy 
3Qxey1kw_vVoDV_lMSq1Lw CMU Istanbul is full of friendly and attentive staff that honestly seem like they enjoy what they are doing The food was fresh hot and delicious It also helps that it won t bust your budget if you enjoy yourself and have an appetizer dinner and desert Just don t forget your own wine This place is definitely on my list if I want to grab a quick dinner for take out on my way home 
3r6Fc683e3gVFZCc0p7Kew CMU Sometimes you need a little karaoke and sometimes you need a lot It was that kind of Saturday A couple of weeks ago I decided to put together a little karaoke event dubbed Whitney oke I think you get it you smart Yelper you All Whitney Houston all the time Usually my crew heads to Duke s Station in Bethel Park far but ribs that make you wanna smack somebody they re that good but we decided to keep it local and head to Stinky s on Hatfield in L ville for their weekly Saturday karaoke What this genius me didn t count on was that when the Pens play the karaoke machine doesn t Sad So we headed to Nico s Recovery Room in Bloomfield not my our favorite place AT ALL but desperate times Unfortunately as is usually the case with Nico s there was nowhere to sit and the cloud of smoke was intoxicating So I turned to Yelp The first place to pop up in my search was Green Pepper a little Korean joint in Squirrel Hill Having never been I called to check on the karaoke details Darren came to know his name later answered the phone and explained that karaoke is free until 10pm but after that would cost 1 25 minute So um that took me a solid 5 minutes to understand I think I asked him at least 4 times Poor guy I d blame booze but I was stone sober at this point I just didn t get it We decided it was worth it especially given that there were 10 people in our party We arrived to an absolutely empty restaurant and were VERY pleasantly surprised to discover a plush leather couch lined karaoke ROOM with a big tv a nice fancy microphone internet access based karaoke software and none of those strange kiddos from Nico s to judge our Whitney antics We set the clock and decided to spend one hour singin our little Whitney hearts out total 80 It might seem like a lot to pay for karaoke but the service was great and the camaraderie well that was priceless Can t wait to go back Britney oke anyone 
3rkjksvCBJ4BIVw6msy3Sw CMU As much of a fan I am of Marriott properties this one is a disappointment Management was great Breakfast was passable But the unforgivable discrepancy was in the bathroom Dirty towel hanging behind the door A used washcloth on top of the shower curtain plainly visible to the naked eye Unacceptable I d expect this at a by the hour trucker motel next to a Walmart Not at an urban Residence Inn and worst of all at any Marriott property 
3rs122F9OVhiVnK-lQ00zQ CMU The low overall rating in my opinion is a totally inaccurate summary of the JCC They provide a TON of different services having to swipe your card twice at the door or finding a broken treadmill should not be the basis for a bad review of a large organization that provides childcare gym space cultural activities classes lecturers festivals it s so much more than what people are describing here I go to the gym at the JCC because I live extremely nearby It is incredibly convenient for me I think the price is reasonable and you can get a couple s membership that is cheaper than two single memberships As a young adult couple we pay 71 a month only slightly more than a single membership so that s a great deal Especially coming from Chicago 35 a month is nothing We don t have the more expensive upgraded membership so we use the standard locker room if you have the fancy membership you use the adults only locker room with a hot tub and TV and couches and stuff but it s totally fine Sure there are kids scampering around but please remember this is a community center not just a gym so there are kids changing for swim lessons and things like that I think the gym facilities are great and I have no idea what anybody would complain about Even at peak hours after 5pm on weekdays I can almost always get right on a treadmill The only exception to this was the first months of the year when New Years Resolution folks swarmed the gym But that will happen anywhere so it isn t the JCC s fault Generally there is no line of people waiting for cardio equipment Any gym where I can immediately get on a treadmill at 530 pm is a miracle in my book in Chicago not a chance The treadmills and ellipticals I think have individual TVs you can bring in headphones and watch TV while you run Some of the audio outlets can get wonky at times but you can almost always find a treadmill with one that works perfectly I think the weight room is well equipped It isn t the biggest ever but honestly it isn t ever crowded so clearly they have all the equipment to meet the demand I do a wide variety of upper and lower body exercises there are several machines for all muscle groups and lots of free weights Occasionally a machine is broken but not nearly as often as other commenters have said We like the staff at the JCC one of the guys in the cardio room always remembers us and our names and tells us when a new machine has come in so we can try it I ve never worked with a personal trainer I have no idea how good they are I know they all have various types of accreditation and degrees in sports medicine and exercise science you can look online and see their qualifications I probably won t be trying their training just because I m confident in my workout routine as it is I did take a group exercise class once 5 each unless you have a fancy membership and it kicked my BUTT in a good way so my impression of the classes is positive Like with any gym when you join there are rules about payment early cancellation that kind of thing Just ask in advance and get it in writing Don t try to cancel halfway through the year and expect them to stop billing you immediately be smart take the initiative and plan in advance if you know you need to cut out of your contract early They told me upon signing that they prefer year contracts but they are willing to work with people who need to cut out early for reasons that can t be helped like moving but you need to be proactive about it Just a pet peeve of mine when people complain about this the gym I used to go to in Chicago had some weird rule where you had to write a letter to the corporate headquarters to cancel Everyone on Yelp was writing reviews like I can t cancel they keep charging me this gym suuuuucks but if you just read your contract or you know ASK a little in advance you can learn how to do it without getting overcharged I haven t engaged in many of their community activities since I m pretty much an atheist and not super connected to Jewish culture but we did stop by their Israel Independence Day Festival they had a petting zoo and they ve had lots of other cool things going on for community members The JCC supports health community involvement child development it s way more than just a place for you to work out 
3rYHES8dgWy3yv2KpZkS1w CMU Woah Thank goodness for yelp That s how I learned about this breakfast gem The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast but before I did I did a quick Yelp search We headed to Pamela s as soon as I saw the reviews There were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down Here s my only complaint We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line which was a bit rude The seating is tight but the atmosphere diner esque Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art some for sale no less The menu while not particularly health conscious was heavy on eggs and pancakes We went with the specialty pancakes banana walnut and choc chip Both were delicious I really wanted to and tried to finish mine but I just couldn t man up The other complaint which is of no fault of the restaurant was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene Despite the deliciousness of the food things got tense for a while I think the next time I have a serious pankcake hankering I ll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela s 
3stg18QQVIyM5inHlp_6-w CMU I lived outside of New York for 7 years We went to theaters clubs restaurants yet I NEVER went to any of the museums or any of the tourist sights Why Because I could do that anytime right Then I left and I look back and think Why the hell didn t I go to the Empire State building Now every time I go back to NY I try to knock off at least one tourist thing and one museum in addition to the usual list of restaurants etc I realized I was about to fall in to the same trap here in Pittsburgh I ve been here a year and eaten about about every conceivable restaurant in the city been to most of the bars but I haven t been to many of the attractions that people talk about that make the city so great So I have made a list a list of things to do in Pittsburgh if I were a tourist And every Saturday I will do at least One Cool Thing in Pittsburgh Today was day one and today was THE CARNEGIE MUSEUMS in Oakland My first comment is man am I tired That is one big museum We started out by visiting the Biennial exhibition a collection of Pittsburgh Artists The work was mixed the photography exhibition was strong I was a little underwhelmed by some of the other work but either way it was awesome to see the work on display and it speaks to the vibrant arts scene here The layout of the permanent collection is one of the most logical and easily flowing I ve ever seen And the collections while not huge are all solid Definitely the right pieces for someone who wants a nice overview of a period of time We were already tired by the time we got through the second floor we never did go down to one collection and decided we had to at least check out the dinosaurs Awesome Got some geological history on the way By the time we saw the T Rex we were both in need of a beer As we walked out we upgraded our tickets to a dual membership We ll definitely be back Can t wait to see what s next on the list 
3Td3gFki2Ii2Ex-ysM9FKA CMU Massive servings friendly folks First timer Decent meal all around I had the Reuben one of my favorite sandwiches so I had to try it here Great big tasty bread toasted not grilled yummy kraut and cheese But the corned beef well they didn t cook it there Must have come in with the rest of the cold cuts Not the reubens I m used to I will come by for the veal parm though There s enough quality to bring me back 
3tkFXMACrnhx2rx_DbXXyw CMU Nice selection of brews and good food Gets crowded during games and on weekends but its a pleasant crowd 
3TMX3My2HXNOQ3B4zu8mTg CMU Tasty and healthy frozen yogurt Tastes a lot like ice cream but has much less sugar and fat Only 90 calories for a small size 16 kinds of fresh toppings you can add such as berries pineapple and nuts A little bit on the pricey side A small size is 3 this is about half size as a cold stone small size ice cream One topping for 1 Three toppings for 1 99 
0TbcoJh2vw3Ey_VFx1OczA Columbia Pros I enjoyed my short stay at this salon My stylist was Janet I arrived at the Salon around 2 00pm and my hair was finished at 3 15pm Great timing My hair turned out very beautiful and shiny The service cost was only 20 for a wash set and deep conditioner However I did bring my own conditioner Everyone was polite and did their best to make me feel comfortable There is also a barber shop within the salon Cons This salon is not upscale in regards to its physical condition however they are very comparable to other salons within the area They did not provide me with a cape before washing my hair so my clothing was splashed with water Overall I was impressed with my stylist Janet and I would definitely return to this salon 
0tcxtoau4SlHWrpnosiAQQ Columbia There is only one reason I ever go to Apple Tree the chipotle chicken Strokos Milano s Subsconscious Westside and HamDel all have salad bars And while you ll probably get more food at Westside and better value at Milano s the chipotle chicken just makes my salad so much better than the surrounding delis that I ll always pick Apple Tree first Everything else about it is average typical NY corner market The lines for the cash register could be less awkwardly structured but that s a small gripe Story one time I dumped my entire salad on the floor of my friend s apartment He picked through it and ate the chipotle chicken off the floor The chicken is that good Or I need new friends 
0TeNSlvvHa7W8OlCiSCJTw Columbia Picked a good day to come Monday Taco flight day So I was able to order four different tacos to try chicken carne asada chorizo and carnitas for 12 They also had a beer flight but im not into beer so I skipped They had a good selection of margaritas but no specials on them They also had negra modelo on tap which my bf loves The decor is cute and colorful with images of La Loteria Luchadores etc The taco I liked best was the carne asada but did not LOVE it They also offer three tacos for 11 75 for LUNCH I dont think I could order 2tacos for 8 50 that s 4 25 per taco yikes I would return for a snack but not a complete meal I would like to see some drink specials that would entice me to come back Not my favorite taco place but somewhere I can return to if the mood strikes 
0tgsiDq5G8lDZL7oNLdDTw Columbia When it comes to ingesting raw fish and other questionable ingredients you had better investigate the place that is producing such items first before you do so Taking my own advice I ordered from Suma after I d read the Yelp reviews thoroughly And my investigation yielded mostly accurate results Yes the sushi is decent and yes they do deliver However had it not been for the wasabi that came with my Spider Rolls no not spider deep fried crab cucumber lettuce and avocado then I would ve been a little disappointed But it was definitely fresh I ll give them that And 9 for 5 rolls isn t TOO bad but a lot of their other items are higher priced However the delivery time was not what I expected it to be given the fact that I live a grand total of two blocks away Maybe it was the snow storm A lot of other reviews have mentioned how much they like this place in the absence of any other real alternative and while I d agree that this probably one of the only places in the area that you can get decent sushi I don t normally award more stars for a oh you didn t suck as badly as I thought you were going to award On days like today where I barricaded myself indoors I d order from Suma again But when the summertime hits I ll walk the 10 blocks down to Whole Foods and buy their sushi instead 
0tPFjaaZsElx6X49Yf6n1g Columbia Based on our visit today this newly opened restaurant places above Ozen and Asia Kan in the Asian fusion sushi delivery arena The restaurant is a pleasant addition to the Harlem Morningside area The atmosphere and type of food are nothing new except for the addition of hibachi Did not try the hibachi but will definitely go back to try it In general there were no surprises PROS bigger portions both the dinner dish of a Thai curry and the sashimi entree were surprisingly generous even the sushi a la carte seemed to have slightly larger portion sizes fresher fish than usual including the scallops and sea urchin which are prone to tasting off pricing fair CONS timing still a little off a bit of a wait for food dishes did not arrive together staff seems a bit hasty and not quite on the ball yet my friend had to ask for cutlery which was delivered in two parts The appetizer to get rock shrimp Delicious and crispy coated in a pleasing mayo spicy sauce Currently I think this place does rank higher than the average sushi place The only question is can they keep up the good work They ve only been open for 3 days 
0U0_O_7JSbpf9nHrpHJT-g Columbia I see that there is a lot of mix reviews on this place The only reason I didn t give this place a 5 star is because the restaurant was so packed that my friend and I had to sit at tall seats by a small counter The service was alright We went for brunch I had the sweet potato waffles which was pretty good and my friend had the baked vanilla bean brulee bread toast which was heavenly We also ordered the turkey sausage but it was very dry For a more thorough review check my blog http greenmilktea wordpress com 
0u1mypdyNJghC20NkyEPbg Columbia Been there twice and ordered from them I have no problem with the food The corn with the cheese and the spices is amazing I ve tried the chorizo tacos and the pork butt don t ask tacos which were also tasty Additionally their house margarita is good especially with the smoky salt rim That being said it is beyond me why you can t get chips and salsa at a time other than fiesta hour Seriously I think we talked the waiter into it the first time we went but it shouldn t require a drawn out conversation to obtain chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant 
0uBxHmkg_QhZK1K_NILmsA Columbia Went there on sunday with my two coworkers and first thing host said was you have 20 minutes to order before we close the kitchen We thought ok we want coffee and desert anyways We sat down and 35 minutes later we asked a waitress if she can help us because no one came to us and she had the worst attitude asked us what coffee we wanted and we asked to please see menu She actually never came back Bus boy started sweeping under our feet while we were still sitting at the table We decided to address this to the host and she kept talking on the phone smiled and said sorry So thank you for the free water and bread and the worst service I have ever received Mc Donalds and Burger King provide better service I would never ever come back or recommend anyone to go there Thank God I did not spend a penny 
0ucn52zcu0VH2Bq0nQBT9A Columbia what you order is not what you get You want french toast with blueberries strawberries and seasonal fruit like the menu lists Order that and you will receive a few blueberries and a ton of gross lardy filler in between 2 pieces of greasy bread for 15 Mention to the rude waitress that it is uh different from the menu and you will hear too rich for you huh coffee is NASTY But enjoy it because it wil never get refilled and yes you pay for that Over and over people write this place is out of ingredients and it is true But they dont have the decency to tell you that their new method is making something else gross and giving it to you You can go up to Tom s and have 6 french toast You can go to many places on the UWS and get great french toast Avoid this place at all costs I left 25 lighter and hungry They charge downtown Manhattan prices but give you something Bubba from Arkansas made from the left over swine fat Avoid 
0uTB94ar2sXGJY74NPy5iA Columbia I ve come here a couple times for brunch I have had a variety of dishes the waffles used in the eggs benedict are a bit too big and overwelming The service is kind of sucky but I usually go just to pick up some pastries I only like the brioche Definitely a hit and miss kind of place But there s wifi if you want to get some work done 
0UU3JV2Od0sc5CyWWfcU5g Columbia Why isn t there an option to give ZERO starts Worst place I have EVER experienced in my life I walked in and wanted to cry it was so bad Yeah it s cheap but the website lies The pictures are decieving and its is just gross If you want to get scabies or some nasty foot fungus because the shower floors are BROWN then stay there Seriously i would not recommend this place for ANYONE 
0uWiHQafTFHRn_7HD2YIaA Columbia BIGGGG good NY experience but the pizza was alriiiiight nothing spectacular I like my pizza cheesier quality was a little low too much flour remained on the crusts and bottom I would go to say you ve experienced a pizza slice that big but DO remember that heartburn will occur Also skip on fries over greased straight out of freezer didn t enjoy it 
0uwoSMsZQFKK-SrLbZb4GQ Columbia Good service decent eats and unlimited refills on coffee Not bad I had heard that this place was a good place to study I did get quite a bit of work done but I m not sure I d come back just to work While the small cozy tables and dim lighting are certainly conducive to intimate conversation I felt a little awkward sitting there with a laptop And room to spread out some papers and set down my coffee Forget about it I left as soon as I finished what I needed to do since there were so many people just standing around waiting for an open table 
0v27guP0PiiJoKcedHzTow Columbia GF and I order Thai market for delivery yay they deliver to us all the way up at 123rd and 8th I very much enjoyed my beef Pad See Ew Noodles were cooked just right and the flavoring was delicious My GF s panang curry with shrimp was delicious and the rice was great too I had not objections to the portion size of my beef Pad See Ew nor did my GF for her panang curry as other reviewers have complained about The delivery service was fast and reliable The reason this is four stars instead of five is that we were both disappointed by the Papaya Salad Just didn t taste right for some reason 
0v5q1C4meOZ2zjWR_qHfjw Columbia Expensive often poor selection and sometimes you seem to be spending a lot of money for very poor quality On top of this before everyone migrated back to Westside market across the street the lines were awful Even if I went there first thing in the morning I had to wait far too long to cash out It should not take 10 minutes to buy milk at 9am on a weekday morning To be honest the only good thing about the place was using my green points to buy Mint Choc Chip HaganDas Ice Cream for 2 per pint But now they ve been used up and I ll never go back 
0V7ClzhhAHBv81e146cOPw Columbia Prices on produce are often the best in the area Buy what s in season and you should be good to go They also have a large selection of groceries including lots of cheeses and a deli too They always have plenty of cashiers so you get in and out with almost no wait A pretty good operation compared to many grocery stores in NYC 
0VlUm-cz0nEfzBwmW5ZpKA Columbia This is one of the few wine bars that I ve been to that caters to every mood if you just want to have a glass of wine on the way home after a hard day at work this is a place where you can shimmy up to the bar by yourself and decompress If you want a spot for a date you can grab a table in the corner and make it a night or a preview depending on how you feel Want to gossip and cut up with a group of your girlfriends they ve got you on that too And the wine selection is extensive and it s thought out and it s always evolving and remaining relevant Which is what you want in a wine bar That and delicious olives Check on both 
0vMt3iVzNWcge96yCsArzw Columbia First off This is not a flashy restaurant I probably wouldn t have gone here had the owner not come up to me while I was looking at the menu for V T and Columbia Cottage and asked me and my family to come in and try his place because it was family friendly I m glad he did This place is like the traditional americanized mexican food restaurant with a cuban puerto rican dominican influence that is common here in New York due to those communities being well established here The beans are black not pinto but that s ok because they do a competant job preparing the food I was pleased to see that they serve breakfast including chorizo with eggs which used to be impossible to find in manhattan I m definately going to come back and try it The service was good There wern t too many people in the place so the Owner waited on us and was very attentive The owner even offered to deliver to people in line for the Concert For Peace at Saint John the Divine accrosss the street The guacamole was fresh the rice had NOT been sitting around for hours and everything seemed made to order with fresh ingredients I especially liked that they didn t pile a mountain of cheese on everything and were confisdent in the flavor of the food itself Like I said this place is not flashy I didn t order anything to drink other than a jarritos but this is not a place where you would go to have drinks with dinner If you want that kind of Mexican food experience go downtown or to Hell s Kitchen This isn t a margarita bar or a beer joint so don t expect to come in and see or be a drunk college girl dancing on the tables 
0w0Jbjj3y6jRxR8aJojVQw Columbia Ok I ve never actually been there but the two most difficult things about moving to Hamilton Heights have been the commute to the gym and the lack of delivery that isn t either pizza or fried chicken both good in their own right but a girl needs her sushi Anyway Saga saved my sanity their sushi is fresh and affordable and to top it off they also have an extensive Vietnamese menu reminds me of the days when I used to live near Saigon Grill Oh and there is no delivery charge below 200th street 
0W88biFbzMfiyZ-SvS0v7g Columbia My friends and I had tickets to see Tracy Morgan at the Apollo so we stopped here for a quick dinner before the show The dining room is small but is dimly lit I think it would be a nice place for an unpretentious date So my friends had seen Melbas on the Food Network show Bobby Flay s Throwdown where they competed to see who had the better chicken and waffles So we went there with great expectations and wanting to try the famous dish Well when I first received my plate I thought boy I m going to be hungry And as I slowly ate my waffle I thought this is pretty good but I didn t think the fried chicken was anything to write home about However the whole is greater than the sum of its parts When you combine the two and eat them in one bite now that is a good dish I don t know what it is about the crispy chicken skin maybe all the grease but it makes the waffle that much better Oh and by the way the dish was surprisingly filling 
0WD9kfa8-Qv3N0fsbzxb1A Columbia I ve been eating there since I was 5 I recommend their eggplant garlic pizza 
0Wj7jiSfvb4NvXw0uH-BDQ Columbia My go to lunch spot for hot and cold subs They have a broad array of selections with a 5 special every day The line can be pretty long during the lunch rush but if you stick with non peak times you ll get in and out quickly 
0wLlKm2ngvf7BN33VMX0YA Columbia Wow Some of the best pastries I have ever eaten I am a big fan of Silver Moon and still am but this place is better Yes better You need to give it a try You will not be disappointed 
0WoRFFPC6zW0cSRVvoSB2Q Columbia Thanks to Yelpers everywhere for pointing out this UPWS bagel haven Took a dozen chewy holes home with me this weekend Despite wanting to I didn t take a bite out of each and every one of them The 2 that I had were delicious The line outside on a weekend morning was somehow a sign of good things to come Definitely give it a try for a New Yawk bagel 
0WRO6ydIa80voAud5Rhpng Columbia Zoma presents a somber escape from the street although the ebony hued bar back lit liquor shelves stone tiles and vast candle lit white walls strike one initially as somewhat incongruous more like a bar in a posh boutique hotel than a local family restaurant Nevertheless the warmth and attention from the staff helps remove any trepidation the severe ambiance might have imbued The two of us shared a combination platter served with ample portions of beef lamb collard greens and spicy red lentils The lentils and beef were our favorite followed by the collard greens The lamb was our least favorite as the meat overpowered the other flavors Overall the sauces were well prepared and balanced In addition they also served a side of chili sauce that combined cardamon and chili to make for a rich and flavorful accompaniment This was our second time at the restaurant and I m sure will be back again 
0wXS5LCNsOoPnPMLS95BUw Columbia Great laid back spot What lured me in where the 20 cent wings because I love wingsss The place is not that big and can get really crowded but they have some seating towards the back of the bar as well as some in the front They also have boardgames you can play while enjoying a cold one 
0WYjPMbl_lmXnI_XHAhoVw Columbia Massawa is not a core shaker but a really decent place to get your Ethiopian fix I ve seen Eritrean and Ethiopian people eat here so I suppose it s somewhat authentic though I m no expert I rather liked the spiciness of their tebsi special and the buttery laced texture of the stewed pumpkin Their lentils and carrot sides are okay The most important thing I must say is the fact that their injera is hot wonderfully tangy and layered on the plate Plus they don t take forever to bring you more Zoma an Ethiopian place with raving reviews on Yelp could learn a lesson or two from Massawa Massawa may not be as hip but it s more genuine and understands exactly what I need comfort I like my injera piping hot and plated with decent portions of what I ordered 
0x3LSFmAtI3i1vu3BPCOHA Columbia I liked it I can t find one thing to complain about Food service and price were all on the money 
0x4tejZ_Yh0eLA4MA_SsgQ Columbia Love the calzones love the garlic knots love the atmosphere The only complaint is that the food can be a little bit bland but that s fine because they provide you with any salt or peppers or cheese you need to spice it up I visit every time I m in NYC 
0XaWwIZnqBo-BKfVaNFamg Columbia Three stars mainly for the food proximity to my house and the fact that it owns Caf Fresh the establishment that used to be there a hundred times over The food is consistently good and I like the space even though it s typically pretty dead which makes the lukewarm service a lot more prominent than it otherwise would be I ve been there for lunch and dinner lunch seemed overpriced 10 for a sandwich I still don t get that but dinner usually has the prix fixe option for 15 which is a good deal all things considered On the other hand the service I would agree is usually subpar I ve only ever seen three servers and none of them are particularly warm or gregarious I usually feel like I m being rushed by the waitstaff which isn t a good feeling when you just want to have a leisurely meal with a book The food comes out quickly enough but I have consistently felt like the waitstaff couldn t care less C mon guys you don t have enough traffic to warrant the I m tired complaint cheer up a bit My other main beef is that the hours in the summer are really inconsistent Morningside Heights is one of those neighborhoods that does suffer from the lack of students in the summer but it really would be nice if they posted clearer year round hours for those of us who stick around 
0xe26dYPnri1PLIwB5Fldw Columbia I was prepared not to like it since I read many negative reviews Thought the service was nice It wasn t that crowded when we went though I ordered the chicken bail creme spinach savory crepe I liked it Could have used more basil creme since it waskinda dry for me bbut I thought it was probably healthier My friend had the French toast and dessert crepe He like them Though nothing earth shattering All theitems were made fresh Note the place was not crowded 
0XGDgJPpJ0pKqBy_MSR_tw Columbia Hey they play at least ten different types of music or so Ted Panken Mitch Goldman and Liz are cool and Phil Schapp and Sid Gribitz are knowledgable I have even woken early on Fridays to listen to the hip hop show Added bonus they don t ask for money on the air at least not on a regular basis like most other non commerical stations Thanks Peter Jennings 
0xhaAujcxUhbgFS1yv4BsQ Columbia Avoid the pharmacy at all costs 
0Y06btNzORHQUDT-wkQ9XA Columbia I live 2 blocks away and don t feel I exploit this park enough The view is beautiful the closeness to the water relaxing the length functional to outdoor physical activity the space never too crowded Totally underrated and left out by 99 of nyc visitors thanks God Yes I m a fan 
0ycw9KpXLs3Vs0_LK0I8Nw Columbia Typical dive bar with pool table downstairs dance floor About 12 different kinds of beer on tap 
0YfvPvcuQLCe9Nv9JbjqBg Columbia Second best garlic knots in the city The pizza is nothing special but it s consistent not too expensive and pretty yummy But for me going for pizza is always about the garlic knots 
0Z--a_IE8VrEEVqExpH7Og Columbia Had a delicous meal here The B combition is very filling as well as the appetizers The only drag was the spicy crepe pancake it was very greasy Overall this is a great restuarant 
0zhOXSTbf-Hl6iIMZUr0gg Columbia The ambiance is wonderful and some but not all of the staff know their wine and liquors inside out I love the Friday night tastings However the delivery the last time I tried it which I confess was about five months ago maybe things have improved takes around an hour which considering my proximity to the store doesn t make much sense I also think they took a real hit when Tyrone left he s one of those guys who forms bonds with the customers and knows both your tastes and the merchandise well enough to recommend solid alternatives if they happen to be out of what you wanted 
0zilPkz-V3eJLL4hf6JfkQ Columbia Oh my God How do you even begin to describe Baby GIrl s Bubbles and Cleaners They come to my apartment about once every two weeks I give them a bag overflowing with dirty clothes They come back 24 hours later right on time sometimes early with my socks all matched up my underwear folded to perfection and my shirts neatly washed and dried and all my garments wrapped in plastic to protect it from the elements Baby Girl I love you and I won t ever leave you 
0ZjKpIEVwo_4-0VsoEoMWQ Columbia Barry Bonds Jason Giambi Koronet Slice Gigantic pizza slices for 3 That s all you need to know 
0zpp5Aga__7c82UxDLOYHg Columbia As other yelpers have said it s a good college bar with a decent beer selection and a wide array of mixed drinks I got the Caipirinha expecting it to be watered down but they definitely don t skimp on the alcohol which is a plus Waiters bartenders are nice enough Some minor complaints are that yet again as everyone has said it is small Be sure to go in there knowing that there are only two unisex bathrooms with gigantic lines to get in You ll be holding it in for the majority of the night but the cramped space helps with that 
0zZm8zQEIOtyf7W3e8tAtg Columbia For the honey tej wine this places gets 5 stars The food is good but I felt that their tibs wett was average And why was the injera cold I expected more for the hype that Zoma received That said I ll probably come back with friends as I do feel that the place is a great intro into Ethiopian food Will update more later when I go back 
0zZs2Np3s7mKS117VVWpIA Columbia Oh how I wish Toast was good We live on the same block and I pass by it whenever I head out of my apartment We couldve had a great relationship Alas the burgers are nothing special and they always forget ingredients when you order takeout 
0z_avI8DqFsO1i2sj75jmA Columbia The atmosphere is a high end diner with outdoor seating and part of the menu is written on mirrors around the restaurant creating an almost Parisian ambiance The food is noticeably better and therefore more expensive than Tom s Restaurant but on a sunny afternoon it is worth it I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich which included swiss cheddar cheeses and tomatoes and fries I have always found that the secret to a good grilled cheese sandwich is the tomato and so I commend Deluxe for getting that right I believe everyone at the table enjoyed their sandwiches too but just to warn you If you arrive around 11 45am or even right at noon for lunch and you shouldn t have a problem Show up at 1 15 and you ll be waiting until tea time 
0_2-rjEMdkVHUEnr-qWbKw Columbia Average Japanese sushi place Nothing special but it wasn t horrible either 
0_9fPRaoB_Xp-ix4syb_8Q Columbia The food only tastes somewhat decent when you re raving drunk Sober it s pretty bad The only saving grace is the BLT Milkshakes should be split between three an order for one will make you sick Try the pistachio or strawberry milkshakes if you must order one Remember Seinfeld didn t actually shoot the interior for a good reason nothing special here 
0_rtJS3NmadjRKZ_JBWHbw Columbia IN SHORT There are other better Mexican restaurants in the city But if you do come here get something cheap and just enjoy their free chips salsa and perhaps try their ice cold margarita A few friends from college and I came here for dinner because we couldn t settle on a restaurant in Morningside Heights or any other restaurant in the vincinity Although the atmosphere was nice and the margarita looked good I didn t try one the food here is simply average The chicken burrito that I ordered tasted bland and so was the beef burrito that my friend got and seriously I did not feel like I was eating in a Mexican restaurant However I definitely enjoyed their unlimited you can always ask for refills chips salsa but these fill you up pretty quickly I thought the service was pretty decent The waiters are always getting us water and refilling our chips Okay place if you just want to talk get some drinks and snack on something which you can do at home as well while catching up with friends 
0_xQH_zT364wYJr-XRluWw Columbia There s nothing bad to say about this place I went here on a Tuesday night It s a small restaurant front so it s easy to miss Once inside the restaurant is about the size of a shoe box By 8pm there wasn t a table that was empty and yet we still felt like we had plenty of space to enjoy each others company without feeling rushed The place is essentially run by one guy who is the host waiter and bus boy The kitchen is well non existent I saw one guy in the back throwing appetizers and main courses into an over sized toaster oven But don t let that scare you away because the quality of the food is not compromised at all this way Some other high points is that it s BYO with no corkage fee That s tough to come by in the city Although I have to mention you get plastic wine glasses at this place but to be honest who cares If you go between 6 8 you get an appetizer and main course for 20 Considering that their duck main course is 20 alone this makes for a great deal for those on a budget I d definitely go back for some more toaster oven goodness 
0_ziEfyEGNSgHIBUgurnBA Columbia Honestly Ollie s is pretty good chinese food If you re in the neighborhood and craving chinese just do it All you hataz it s chinese food don t expect a big production It s salty saucy and sometimes greasy just eat it 
1-IBKvePBi8I5Yaw8AnnJg Columbia Cheap fast and pretty good is exactly what this place is I went about 4 months ago and haven t been back however I would go if it were convenient I really did love their chips which was a sweet potato fry type food It is worth trying but not something I will go out of my way for 
1-iNhZ0gVUKquHKqjIRA0A Columbia Great prices amazing food Careful with the lasagna as it weighs about 5 pounds but it s SO good As are all the other dishes hearty is definitely the word for this spot 
1-KzpFxU2K6hhDwAPuS0Gg Columbia This is a cool after work spot The drinks are reasonable and the food is great The place is pretty small so get there early so you can get a seat The music is always pumping They play a mixture of Hip Hop R B and old school The crowd is cool and the bartenders are helpful and friendly 
1-QpjnfETt_7tvDrxjX8CA Columbia Harlem Skin Clinic gives special and individual attention to their costumers which I have not experienced at any other salon or center over the past 6 years of getting waxed They were able to accommodate my schedule and even stayed open way past their operating hours due to a small delay in the appointment time All staff that I have so far met are friendly and easy to talk to I hope to have another service from them soon 
10BsdKHLeUSXjN-UORjoqQ Columbia HOLY F CHICKEN F GYRO OK so I work nearby on broadway and was looking for something different to eat that wouldn t break my pockets I saw this place on yelp and I always walk past on my way to the 1 train so I thought I d try it FRIGGGGGIN AWESOME HANDS DOWN best gyro I ve EVER eaten taste fresh from the chicken to the veggies to the bread I should buy my Boyfriend one for dinner as this one will last me through lunch and dinner this is just tooo amazing I will definitely be going back on a regular basis 
10bUMV6Zp2eUPTQQeLQBhg Columbia I wish there were more late night places like this in Boston What can I say It s Indian in a burrito a burrito Make sure you get the hot sauce but be careful because it s pretty spicy Therefore if you don t love spicy foods then ask for it on the side 
10km-ai0ywWj72-2G0jQCA Columbia When you re inside it you re actually outside again it is so big Outside I was listening to music and I found my mp3 player to be reporting it had zero flash available zero flash free and zero files when I turned it back on after I exited the church This left me without my perfect set of music for the rest of my trip Why God why 
10_ue8r3eSfjL-rrFN7CYg Columbia A few other graduate students and I ordered from this place to help fuel our end of the semester celebration We were amazed that they would deliver until 12 on a weeknight and we had a strong craving for Mexican food We also heard that they deliver margaritas in hilarious Chinese restaurant soup containers which was an added plus We ordered delivery which was a mistake Ridiculously crappy service and the fact that it was only a mediocre value kill this place for me The menu has a large variety of options but in my opinion prices were jacked about a dollar or two higher than what was fair and this takes a toll on the poor graduate student s budget Even though we made sure to repeat our order three times and have it repeated back to us to ensure it was understood they still mixed up two of my friend s orders and if one were a vegetarian it could have been the difference between dinner and no dinner Also they tacked on a mysterious delivery charge that caused my 10 Nachos to spike up to 16 when all was said and done and the delivery charge was split between 3 people There was absolutely nothing special about the food The best part about my meal was a wedge of avocado my friend had on the side of her burrito that she gave to me so I probably could have walked to Appletree Market bought an avocado and saved myself 12 I will likely never order from this place ever again and I d only halfheartedly recommend it if it s late at night you re desperate for takeout and nothing else is open 
1115SCacjD9Fg1vagoGhWg Columbia They have a wonderful free wine tasting every Friday night and in better weather often have wine tours to the Hudson Valley I get their online newsletter to keep up 
11ljGnDIQtK87-vSfgHDdQ Columbia Hmm with so many good brunch places in the area I hardly think KU is worthy of the hoards of people it attracts I ordered the woodstock pancakes and they were good but a bit dry My friend s dish some sort of egg item was also pretty average Sadly overpriced and overhyped 
11XVh_L411bku81z0rSBcg Columbia Love this place feels like Italy a happy homey atmosphere great food at a good price The lamb chops are the BEST 
12880KfSR5A7rF3mu_jH8w Columbia While the lunch specials are awesome I absolutely cannot bring myself to give Saga any more stars just because the service is atrocious and I get the distinct impression that the waiters think their customers are complete dummies This didn t stop me from going to Saga until I came here with a couple of other people about a week ago and have since vowed never to return My friend found a 2 inch plastic shard in his papaya salad We informed the waitress who offered to bring us a newly made dish Friend didn t mind the plastic that much it looked clean but he accepted her offer Waitress waited about 5 minutes and brought out another plate of papaya salad However it immediately became clear that she didn t notice my friend had already dumped half of his dressing onto the first version of the dish Thus when we received the new salad and found some dressing pooling at the bottom of the plate tasted dressing in the soggy papaya shreds themselves and noticed someone had placed some not marinated by salad dressing papaya shreds on top of the marinated shreds so that the salad initially appeared fresh and crisp it was pretty clear what the servers had done Lame If plastic shards don t scare you and you end up eating here get the bun xao apparently Saga s most popular dish la sa ga chicken and noodles cooked in coconut broth very filling sate sweet peanut butter sauce or curry Their sushi doesn t taste that great and I m wary of the quality considering the customer service 
12GDPqkc9CXKE6cFE5qIvA Columbia Toast and I have a history You see there was a time when I thought I could handle Lex s Long Island Iced Tea Challenge The challenge was hard fought but somewhere amidst the 4th pint of well spirits and soda something happened Something blurry and dizzy And then I woke up on the floor of the bathroom at 5am with 26 text messages and an angry Lex knocking at the door I was arrested on Halloween just outside the front doors of the establishment I have dated women I ve met there bonded with friends and even met one of my closest cohorts at the restaurant Good times aside Toast isn t anything particularly special in and of itself For the Manhattan School of Music alum however its appeal can t be denied As the best local watering hole near the campus Toast has served students well in their after school revelry for years Judged purely as a restaurant and bar Toast comes out just above average The seating is uncomfortable and there is never enough room the bar is too small and the atmosphere is well forgettable That aside it is indeed homely They make a mean burger even if the fries suck They have great beers on tap and the prices are just right So my advice to you Don t go out of your way to visit Toast but if you live in the area or happen to be an MSM student drink up and enjoy 
12GsaBPLWWrc8MrCm9s9jQ Columbia Maybe the waitress recognized me All I can say is that at 11 25 am I decided to give them another chance I was starving I sat down 11 26 my order was taken at 11 35 I ordered Lentil Soup and Quiche Lorraine both daily specials I walked out at 11 54 still starving there were less that 15 customers in the restaurant and there was plenty of staff My waitress was having a great conversation with the bartender though I went to Vine good service no problem Sigh 
136Ch7L0nMpuHTJNdLReXQ Columbia Love the triangle rice balls Things tend to be on the expensive side but the sale items are great Check out line can be pretty slow sometimes 
13FfpXRC-I8BeQtvKOtdIw Columbia Friday 5 to 7 2 draft beers From here it is all down hill A mixture of Columbia students and regulars from around the corner the atmosphere in this cave like bar is no place to take a date find a date nor intrduce to someone you are trying to impress Friday at 5pm BYOF bring your own friends 10 good times 
13SCOUyXmwMJLRvgLBE3nQ Columbia This place boasts that it s more than just the Seinfeld diner It s menu brags about having the freshest and finest ingredients available The soggy tuna melt and undercooked fries suggest anything but fresh and the Seinfeld gear for sale imply it really is just the Seinfeld diner Also the staff hussles you like they got a line down to Hell s Kitchen even though it s only half full 
145-CcHnrnAIZ7GV5f6iwg Columbia I love this place and I actually think it s hands down the best soul food in Harlem That s not to say that some of the others aren t good but they are the only ones who get the spirit right and I think they just have the best food There are a lot of complaints about the wait and I ll be honest I m not a planner and I ve taken people here when I have the urge and have ended up having to wait longer than I would have liked even with a reservation But if you have ever eaten in New York you know the deal Furthermore the dining room is really small and I think this is one of the few times that the phrase intimate setting really does fit For two years I ve supported the restaurant because each time I ve gone I ve had fun It s one of the few places where you can go an eat and meet new people while enjoying a fine meal Perhaps the intimate setting plays a role in that If you re not a people person I wouldn t recommend going on Monday night or anytime someone is having a birthday the whole restaurant sings But this is what really makes this place standout At least for me it s more than just is the food good the service has got to work and here the service is peerless in Harlem Sure the wait may be long but once you take a seat you ll experience the finest service in Harlem Now the food I ve had lots of things on the menu but the chicken and waffles are great I don t like fruit at all but Melba has me craving for the strawberry butter with my waffles Now to be fair it s not a full waffle they are three small waffles which is fine by me because the bird is really the star of the show The crispy outer and juicy inner is exactly what fried chicken should taste like and when the syrup from the waffles manages to stick to the skin that s when the magic begins I love the macaroni and cheese but this is really a matter of taste I love how cheesy it is But those who don t like it I understand why I also love the catfish and the sauce they have on the side is delicious The potato salad and greens are also delicious I ve had the tilapia and it was ok and I m not really a fan of the spinach But those are my only two complaints The cocktails are also delicious If you want a full experience in Harlem this is the place to go I d say it offers the second best atmosphere yea that place with the Red awning may have them beat on atmosphere by a hair But I definitely prefer the food here 
14GWV_GGskgWUJJ0mShWmg Columbia Big slice but not very tasty Plus homeless guy allowed to go thru trash several times for slices and shake spices on not pleasant to watch while eating 
14Qc-G_2me9PZq0qhNGd_A Columbia OH MY FOODGASM I love bagels I used to get the double pack of bagels from Costco toast it and load on some Philadelphia cream cheese and call it a delicious bagel Man was I naive When I came to New York there were 3 things I HAD to eat cheesecake pizza and bagels I LOVE cheesecake and pizza I only added bagels to my list because they are well known in New York I kept asking myself how good could a bagel be 5 STARS GOOD Absolute Bagels you have turned me into a bagel snob The bagels are so fresh Lightly toasted on the outside but incredible soft in the inside Oh and the spreads are so rich I got both the lox and chive and garlic and both were excellent 
14y1yCQ_nuvdYkGUvzJQUQ Columbia I ve put off reviewing SIP because I don t want more people going there There I said it On the other hand I would like it to stay in business and while I ve struggled long and hard with the dichotomy of my feelings here I am What a great break from my usual Columbia University food crawl The music is always good and by good I mean good if you were born before 1985 and partied to real music I m not being ageist Well ok fine I am The music is even better if you happen to be in the neighborhood at night because they have DJs who spin the aforementioned good music nightly The food is on point and if you come Mondays it s half off Tuesdays wine is half off with 2 food orders You get free tapas if you come for after work drinks for happy hour 5 7 See where I m going with this Cheap food cheap liquor and free tapas What s not to love Well The space isn t big the tables are small tips are automatically added to your bill And that puts some people off I personally don t care I prefer not to do math when I ve been drinking to completely be honest and the service is ALWAYS impeccable so they deserve it thankyouverymuch 
15Cex1Kg-1fxwQ0PW0yEKA Columbia The thing that stood out the most here bad service like really really really bad service The WORST I ve ever had Granted we were here on a busy Sunday brunch time But when we were seated it took them 10 min to acknowledge us with no water on the table no utensils either We had to ask for water twice before it was brought out please sir some water I ordered a sweet crepe that did not come with any sides so I asked if I could have potatoes on the side You would think I grew a second head from the way the waiter reacted from my question it took him a long time to realize what I was asking no you can t have potatoes with your crepe but I will pay extra no it doesn t come with potatoes Our utensils were also supplied to us AFTER our crepes arrived on the table The dining room area also gets very smoky to the point where it is noticeably smelly I ve also noticed the lingering smell on my clothing for the rest of the day Not pleasant The crepes however were excellent I had the raisin almond and apple crepe They cook all of the fillings with the crepes so I was pleasantly surprised by my melted sweet apple filling However my boyfriend did not enjoy finding his smoked salmon crepe cooked through I would give Crepes on Columbus a second chance I think it might have been a bad service day for them 
15MASdG9-_w3lo8Mf0lMZg Columbia Just got delivery from Taqueria for the first time It came very quickly even at peak dinner time on Friday night And the food was still hot I knew you would never let me down Taqueria 
15vhCmOF5fja2StXeMFkOQ Columbia Their chicken and beef shawerma is really good My favorite dish is The Works with added chicken or beef You get some salad and from protein in your system I ve been there quiet a few times and I still like it 
16a4Z-RD6B7jJKCQhGDyjw Columbia I met four of my friends here a few weeks ago The food was good but the service was just eh We arrived and there was a group of five there before us but I wasn t sure how the tables worked so I looked around and went to sit at a table for four and grab an extra chair Don t do that this is a place where they seat you It doesn t seem like when you first walk in and most BBQ places I ve been too are seat yourself Eventually the five in front of us get seated and then my friends and i get seated They did have sweet tea which is a win for everyone and it was homemade and not that nasty processed stuff I had a pork BBQ sandwich which was really tasty with a side of baked beans I remember not enjoying the baked beans as much as I wish I had but my friends got mac and cheese and that was well worth it The sweet tea and mac and cheese are tasty and the food is good so worth a check out 
16G8frLFptB0zT2lWVhPaQ Columbia Red and white interior brick walls and candles that set a romantic feeling when you walk in Def a date place We had the best seats in the house because we were the first to show up The show lasts an hour and there are not much options on the menu for food but for drinks there are a lot of pages Come on Thursdays I overheard one of the players on this day was nominated an oscar award Appetizers Roasted Corn Soup Creamy corn soup Nothing fab Crostini YUMMY Little pearl onions that keep dropping from the crostini when I take a bite along with the peas Nice mixture of flavors with crunch Entrees Black Truffle Coq Au Vin We ordered this dish to have the mash potatoes veggies and the sauce The mash potatoes were the soft crushed type and we mixed the veggies and sauce with our rice dish b c it was too boring to us The chicken fed my dog and stray cats and they loved it p Hand Cut Semolina Pasta It reminded me of lasagna This dish was dry and boring too Vegetarian Spring Risotto Mushrooms does wonders to a dish Again we were not so happy with the flavors so we added the veggies and sauce from the chicken dish It did not have a creamy consistency like it was suppose to Dessert Fresh Berry Shortcake First time I had shortcake and I wasn t so impressed by it The serving was not proportional The cake overpowered the filling Peach Upside down cake First time I had this too and I enjoyed it But after having a few more bites it tasted sickening The show was good but the food was not Our server was terrible too He had the worse attitude 
16gLyBFKvTm8bOhOg7JPmw Columbia Not a bad place to go with friends if you re looking for something close to campus Food is alright and prices are reasonable I always order the bento box and they give A LOT It s definitely worth it though Service is pretty fast and attentative but sometimes the place gets so loud that you really have to speak up to hear anybody Not somewhere I prefer but if you want to make a quick decision about where to go for dinner this is the place 
16howGeGR-YrH_BQljy25g Columbia We went here on a Scoutmob deal and really liked it The food was good not amazing although I ve probably never had a better Tiramisu in my life OK only in Italy I have The octopus was cooked perfectly so I would recommend that and if you want to try something a little different the fried artichokes on tahini was pretty good too I definitely would come back here if not for the food then for the ambiance It was very romantic and cozy and reminded me of good little restaurants in Europe Overall a really good find in our area 
16jDU9fe-zuc4WtDHSycMg Columbia Only one thing to order here ladies and gents the bibimbap is somewhat passable I never eat anything else at Mill A lot of people hate on Mill but really there s no other Korean food until 32nd St There s usually no wait here the interior is dimly lit almost but not quite to the point of being romantic The Mill your only option for Korean food not cooked by Chinese people in the UWS 
16lGjtls-rwrbNJFdl0KYg Columbia I like this small Italian spot It s cozy intimate ambience is comforting to even those far from the Italian culture Food proportions are a little smaller than used to but very good The staff is friendly and welcoming They do however have a limited menu so don t expect to get the usual from other Italian franchises like Olive Garden or others Meal prices are really good as well Relatively cheap prices from what I am used to especially from a upscale restaurant Overall great place to eat with friends or the special someone Full bar is available 
16PWskwUh_gkIsYYXz5vZw Columbia As an expert of brunch spots I would say this restaurant was average in service not a typical comfortable brunch environment and certainly not meant for rowdy drinking but above average in terms of the food quality and options This place is a lot fancier then the usual brunch spot and it threw me off This means that A You feel the need to wear real clothes and brush your hair at 10am on a sunday and B If you become intoxicated due to the unlimited mimosas you will feel very uncomfortable and weary about making sure you don t speak too loudly or appear drunk because no one else is For me the fact that I didn t feel comfortable ask for multiple refills and felt the need to maintain a good posture because there were elderly people and children brunching as well was a bit of a downer The only negative was that if you wanted to get the fixe brunch with the unlimited drinks the options of your meal were very limited I believe there were 5 choices They are all good options and good for veggs too but you can t be too picky The food was very good the burger was especially well cooked and very big the mushroom omlette was good and the corn beef hash was satisfying and unique with it cooked on a skillet with eggs The menu had a good selection with healthy and unique combinations for breakfast if you re not doing the fixe menu and they also had an extensive wine selection I may go back but not to drink and I would probably bring my parents because the average age of customers in the place was approx 45 
16RnE3ulM4e6Ni-AkfWEiA Columbia The place is really clean looking and filled with very nice looking sweets and pastries I picked up a cake and baklava the owner is Greek I believe for my friend s birthday and everyone was satisfied with the selections The cashier even gave us free paper plates and plastic utensils enough for about 30 people Definitely recommended 
16Z-T5ariYys3O1zjPPEkg Columbia This is a great lunch place Don t get too excited because there aren t any places to sit Perhaps they can invest in a little outside seating area I know it s just a market but it has the potential to be a little cafe Plus you can t just sell delicious food and expect people to wait until they get back to their offices to eat What if they want to eat it right there and then You have to provide adequate space for them to do so Ridiculous Well the food is good but needs a few adjustments Today I had the 1 2 lb of the spinach tomato and feta pasta and the 1 4 lb of tomato basil mozzarella salad Both delicious However the salad wasn t salty enough and the pasta was a little too salty My suggestion take some of the salt you used for the pasta and put it on the salad I know I m a genius Yesterday I had the mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich with balsamic vinegar I hated the bread It was some sort of a cheesy bread with olivey stuff on it Not good They should switch it with the bread they use for the mozzarella tomato basil and chicken sandwich I think that would be a more successful combination And on tuesday I had the spicy salmon sushi You really have to like salmon to order this for lunch No I mean really like it because there is a half a ton of salmon in each sushi bite But on a brighter note the sushi rice was cooked perfectly unlike the sushi in Morton Williams or in M2M which are a block away from this joint Despite all of my complaints I still gave this place 4 stars because I ll be back there tomorrow and I don t want anyone spitting in my tomato basil mozzarella concoction Not that they have in the past I m just saying 
16z1e99mnUalUcZIQKWj3g Columbia Yes it is true The spicy special is awesome I ve ordered it 4 times now and it is consistently good It comes toasted and warm though it maintains integrity after cooling down If you call ahead and order 10 minutes before pickup they ll have it ready for you So you cut down on the time spent hanging around the store Then walk across the street to the sculpture garden next to St John s Cathedral Unwrap your sandwich and enjoy the moment This is a great sandwich to pick up on your way to the park the airport or wherever Transports easily for a meal on the go 
16ZF7RK9MSNCxasGJsVYAA Columbia Okay so the majority of their wines may be on the pricey side But sometimes a ginormous selection is worth just that Beside the insanely expensive juice is a treasure trove of fantastic values Anything you want from the old world is here along with new world gems as well The Betts and Scholl Grenache The Chronique is unbelievable at 28 a bottle If you ve never had Grenache before you don t know what you re missing Think of it as Pinot Noir s warm climate cousin and if you get off on new world Pinots this one is sure to float your boat About the cheapest you ll find here is 8 a bottle but if you spend a few bucks more the selections in the 10 15 range rock hard core Crazy juice like Loire Valley Malbec and some obscure Bobal from Argentina are available for your consumption If you find yourself staring at the shelves of wine like they re written in Egyptian hieroglyphics make sure and talk to Victor as he knows his shit and can find you some awesome off the beaten path wines that will rock your world Drink outside the box 
17Aac5_4CSUlCoemkl1ZCw Columbia pizza crust 5 stars service 3 stars prosciutto on pizza was negative stars more like big tough chunks of salty ham Dont get the goat cheese and prosciutto toping 
17jxkbs6pwPlly8TYAKxUQ Columbia Went for lunch and had the steak sandwich It was delicious The atmosphere is nice My girlfriend got the salmon which is the only reason this wasn t a five It was bland and overpriced I would come back for the great sandwiches 
17Wx_ZHwOvb0zixdM1bfJg Columbia This location is close to my friend s apartment so I ve been here twice so far and probably plan on coming back multiple times I like this location because it s not as crowded as the upper east side and midtown west locations on normally busy hours The service leaves a bit to be desired as both times we ve had trouble getting the attention of our waitress waiter multiple times throughout the meal drinking The food is pretty good here I ve tried the chicken burrito chicken quesadilla and nachos and I think better than the other locations from what I remember The chicken is pretty flavorful and moist which was good The nachos come super loaded with toppings as well Other than that not much else to say about this place besides definitely get the frozen margaritas 
18-OLzyqFBxULb2BXIHiIg Columbia 1 Star because um where do I start I went on date to Vine The place is like very bad fast food place They seat you fast they take your order fast and take away your plates even faster As we were being seated an Asain couple took our seats the hostess told us that they were first but they arrived after we did Hum interesting or Racist They sat us in a corner by the kitchen As we were taking off our coats a watiress comes by and says do you know what you want first I think we have to look at the menu Then we ask her to come back 2 mins later she s back takes our order and then another waiter comes to take our order The food arrives in a matter of mintues less then 4 mins which leads me to think how fresh is it Not very the mash potato which I have yet to see in japenesse cusine is cold and stale The cubed garlic seasoned beef is tasteless PS the beef still had the fat attached nasty My date had sushi i tasted a few pieces it was OK Point is I only eat a quarter of my food because I was starving and was afraid to order anything else Customer service does not exist at Vine Food Quality is comparable to the worst fast food you ve ever had 
18iOdp2NMDPIMfGhaWG2aA Columbia Wish I had known about this place before I lived in the hood 3 years and dropped off my laundry to a surly woman just 1 block away I finally found out this place did pick up and delivery a little too late I had a few loads done by them just as I was moving away I had them deliver to my new apt and pickup from my old There was some miscommunication and my laundry was left there for weeks I thought they were going to call me they thought I was going to call them But everything worked out The guy who picks up and delivers was sent like 10 20 min after I called each time My clothes came back SO NEAT I mean like a machine had folded them All my shirts top exactly the same size rectangles and with such crisp folds I almost want to keep sending my laundry back to them even tho I live in a building now with a nice laundry room that has machines that take credit cards 
18qDySrIWDDJ1I7N1Ak5Xw Columbia holy shit omelettes that s all this is about omelettes they make them all day why would i ever order anything else oh wait they also make a brie green apple avocado sandwich that made me cream my pants ok fine holy shit omelettes and brie green apple avocado sandwiches good God almighty i knew i liked omelettes but i never knew the depth of that now DEEP love i also didn t think i liked fancy sounding sandwiches that was before i realized there is nothing fancy about putting brie apples and avocado on delicious homemade bread just something creative ingenious and freaking DELICIOUS 5 stars all day and all night they serve omelettes all day why would you ever get anything else unless its the aforementioned sandwich p s im sure the rest of their menu is astounding but i havent moved on from omelettes and brie green apple avocado sandwiches if you couldn t tell 
18QJ139e09WzLmotbORZ2g Columbia Cheap and delicious grill food great for grabbing an Asian snack or drink between classes 
18ytiDS0kKZwJx8-AOd_mg Columbia The garlic naan was really thick and garlicky and yummy Service was good Chicken curry was ok but the meat tasted a little old The Navratta Korma was blah The peas were undercooked and the sauce tasted thin They were also supposed to be spicy and medium respectively but neither was very hot at all The entrees came with giant portions of rice but the rice was clumpy and not fragrant 
18zrkSOoCpy-Ttv-rTolQA Columbia The proper name of this place should be Comfort and Compromise comfort because the residents have a dining option within the house elevator and compromise because they truly compromise many standards by dining there I eat at Barnard Columbia locations more often since the only consistently reliable option is a breakfast Other meals tend to support a high carb and low taste diet which I am not a particular fan of So it s 1 from 1 star for convenience but not a dime more 
19WrJEq48Z4KbdaWGtgIjQ Columbia Fantastic haircut With the student discount I paid 50 which is much more than I d pay back home but pretty reasonable for NYC I brought a few pictures of what I was looking for in a haircut chopping like 8 inches off and Jesse worked with me making sure that she understood what I wanted and how I style my hair I ended up with a cut that works really well with my hair type and is easy to style I think it is one of the best cuts I ve ever gotten Will definitely go back Thanks to another review I knew that I could pay for my haircut with my Mastercard but I would have to pay the tip in cash 
19zK6CHjLb7KYaqdfJuyfA Columbia Standard pub fare college crowd adequately priced for the quality of food served Cab fare rebate is a nice gimmick but it is par for the course for beer selection entertainment and food If you want something predictable and safe with ample TV s for sports watching choose here Nice selection of wings ranging from wimpy to nuclear fission hot and all the usual suspects on draft 
1A37MfeNhAGcOiXHjUlDeA Columbia The ambiance and decor is the only reason why I m giving 3 stars I came here to celebrate my youngest sister s birthday and I was underwhelmed by their service and the attitude of of server It was 6 of us and 3 other seated around the grill and after about 15 minutes of waiting we were told to be patient because there was only one chef on that night Can you explain to me why there was only one hibachi chef that night The chef was great he did the same tricks throwing food in our mouths volcano in he onions that you would see at restaurants alike and made the experience great 4 6 of us ordered from the grill except for me and one of my other sisters because I am allergic to shellfish and I was without my EpiPen Apparently they have a rule where 5 6 have to order from the grill in order to be seated there I m not sure why they shared that with us because the place was practically empty The food was very bland and definitely did not wow me 
1aHIp8ZlQKas3zxwvgyVDQ Columbia I consider myself Vareli s first loyal customer I ve been going here since they had paper menus My roommate and I lived right around the corner and witnessed the transformation from hardware store to lovely restaurant The bartenders are amazing one a literal rockstar The upstairs has been home to many of my pals events engagement party graduation dinner birthday dinner and is the best place to reunite with college pals It s pretty much my St Elmos Fire My recommendations the cheese platter the homboldt fog is amazing lamb burger and roasted chicken Last but not least my personal favorite barcardi and coke I miss you guys 
1aimIq80QTR9HTKFtyqvgQ Columbia My boyfriend loves this place more than he loves me I have to admit that I can t be too jealous though because the bagels are pretty darn good Toasted to perfection with rich cream cheese I haven t tried the tofutti cream cheeses yet and don t plan on it but how cute that they have them 
1ayAZJSyOTWAopkxrl7hVg Columbia Nice Little French Bakery Great Croissants Very Friendly Staff and owner I would check it out if you live in the area 
1aYEGwlOU4jrLelhPQFb8Q Columbia I would like to preface this review by saying that I am not a rack and soul kind of girl In fact I generally don t eat anything that formerly had a rack so I m probably not the best judge of this place That being said I popped in to Rack and Soul for a late dinner snack last night It opened this past summer to very good reviews and I am sure that all of the applewood smoked BBQ stuff is very good Upon sitting they immediately brought over a sample of warm cornbread which was excellent a nice combination of sweet and savory I ordered the three side platter 10 and picked mac cheese mashed potatoes and collard greens Given that excess butter and salt are supposed to be the main ingredients in these dishes that s what makes them taste good I still think they were all a little too salty The collard greens came with bits of BBQ pork in it which I wasn t crazy about but it added a lot of flavor The mashed potatoes and mac and cheese were good but not great In terms of side dishes Mamie s Spoonbread a few blocks away probably has them beat Overall I think the atmosphere of this place is really cute It has a warm diner feel with a long counter and cushy red booths It also does a nice job meshing the spirit of Harlem with the gentrification of the Upper West Side I think it is a welcome addition to the neighborhood 
1b6JreBchfUoYP82Zko_YQ Columbia The day after I posted my first review of Haakon s Hall I received a message from James the chef owner apologizing profusely for the bad service we had and asking for a second chance The following week I went back with most of the same group and he made sure the menu item I had asked about was available the service was friendly and attentive a different waitress and he even came out to personally check on us several times He also offered us an amuse bouche that I didn t have but I gave my portion to the Norwegian guest at our table and he and everyone who tasted it thought it was delicious Since my original review was not based on the food but only one individual I decided to update the review after they made sincere efforts to address their customer s complaints and provided a very positive experience on our second trip 
1b9nScp30uhlr1P8TCWquA Columbia Good coffee but the biggest thing to commend this place are how nice the employees are Generally I like to complete a service transaction politely but quietly but I don t feel weird chatting with the baristas baristers as they make my coffee It s a little pricey 3 5 depending on how stupid your drink is but I guess you re paying for service and supporting local business etc Under the Oren s awning seems a favorite place for Morningside Heights local homeless to set up shop which can make treating yourself to coffee an experience fraught with intellectual complications re luxury versus the material needs of life itself I imagine it is probably a pretty lucrative place to collect change from for this reason 
1bfELvtQe_KCBErhbIFymA Columbia Just tried this spot out after starting a new job in the area I was so glad to find something reasonably priced Now I know why it s so much cheaper than anything else nearby I ve never had falafel as bland or dry as Amir s before It was like sawdust but flavored with a synthetic falafel seasoning from a packet There was little else in the pita pocket except some bits of lettuce and a flavorless tomato I also ordered some kind of heavy chewy smelly dough that was posing as a spinach pie I saw the spinach I was looking RIGHT AT the spinach but I couldn t taste any spinach when I was finally brave enough to taste the thing I hate wasting a lunch I m still so hungry and am stuck in meetings for the next couple of hours so please take this review to heart if you feel the same way 
1bFlYGrnoO5f88dJXffIbA Columbia The experience I had at this restaurant with my wife and two friends with almost identical to the one described by Chris T We recently saw that a new place was opening and wanted to try it our for a few reasons 1 it s in our neighborhood a couple of blocks from my apartment 2 my wife and I are Mexican and it s really difficult for us to find some great tasting Mexican food in NYC So when we walked in and were greeted within a minute or so shortly after that with some chips from a package and salsa identical to Pace Picante we were off to an okay start We each ordered food I had the chipotle chicken burrito my wife had the steak burrito and my two friends had mole dinner plate and the shredded chicken burrito Though my burrito wasn t too bad due mainly to the taste of the chipotle sauce it certainly was not worth the 9 25 I was charged for it especially since the menu said it was 8 50 Having been open for a week there couldn t have already been price increases My wife s steak burrito well I ll just borrow from Chris T s review the meat was bland dry and overcooked it also lacked a binding agent e g meat marinade or salsa Neither of the two salsa sides added much flavor spicy or otherwise to distract from the dry meat My friend who ordered the shredded chicken burrito almost choked on the dry meat and ordered a side of sour cream thinking it might help They brought her a container obviously designed to hold no more that a tablespoon of an ingredient with what literally looked like watered down sour cream She was disgusted and not only didn t eat the sour cream but also gave up trying to eat the burrito OH and they charged her 2 for that side of sour cream Now mediocre food should at least be made up with great service but don t hold your breath here Our waiter after the initial greeting took forever to come back to our table forgot more than once of the items that had been requested another soda the side of sour cream etc and though only carrying four plates could not remember who ordered what or what the plates even were I mean he literally stood there for at least a minute trying to decide which burrito was which before he decided he should take them back to the kitchen for clarification Luckily my friends and I are close enough that we told him just to leave them and we d sort them out And mine was wrong Not only did it not have the shredded chicken in chipotle sauce as advertised on the menu but it was extremely dry grilled chicken with no guacamole or chipotle sauce AT ALL on the plate In short less than mediocre food terrible service horrible value This is one addition to the neighborhood I was not glad to have experienced My wife and I will not be returning there Apologetically only for what now feels like a betrayal on my part for not having said this sooner I highly recommend that you instead go to my favorite Mexican food spot just three short blocks away Taqueria y Fonda la Mexicana which is better priced in terms of value better in taste just better all around 
1BfuuWmGuLbqGTuinD-qOA Columbia My boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner after checking out the Central Park pool I didn t know what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised We walked thru the doors and were immediately welcomed by the staff and seated After taking a couple of minutes to scan the menu I decided on that pappardelle pasta and my boyfriend opted for the beer and burger special We got a side of the corn and mushrooms Everything we had was delicious You could tell that the staff took their food and the restaurant seriously This place is definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood 
1Bm-YLw0zCUDXlMQ9bd7VA Columbia I ve eaten enough brie here to kill a lesser man 
1brSTSCS8y-YsI6PKbHCqw Columbia In the category of wine bars Nectars atmosphere is on par with any of NYC upscale wine bars I am sure this was a big gamble for the owners which looks to have been a good decision Nectar is a great addition to the going out environment in Harlem The wines seem to be a selection from their adjacent wine store Being a very closed minded wine drinker I wish they had a few wine from my preferred list However even with my very closed minded taste preference I have found wines on their menu I enjoy drinking If you live in Harlem or passing through and like the wine bar feel this is the only place you need to be 
1BuLlkR_ZNMOBrDqdvxHcg Columbia One of my favorite soul food spots in NYC If you are travelling with a large group or want to visit this place during peak periods then you will be disappointed This is a small establishment but definitely worth the trip A note to those of you looking for your Mama s or your Nana s homecooking stop making comparisons or just go to your beloved s house for a meal Spoonbread serves excellent food and is one of the best in Harlem I love the food here I have been coming here since Ms Mamie opened My meal tonight Smothered Turkey Wings Cornbread Stuffing Collard Greens Candied Yams And yes I ate it all 
1BUYiiFhPN5T1M0YfOzz8w Columbia I must say I was very disappointed Ive read many many good reviews but my experience was not as good as many others I guess Had the chicken breast which was cooked nicely but tasted like any rotisserie chicken from Dallas BBQ my boyfriends salmon on the other hand was dried and had no taste even when we mixed it with the vinaigrette it was horrible The only thing worthy was probably the view 
1BVI1a-tu8n2vd2RwY9pUA Columbia I ve never been disappointed with a meal here In fact I just get the special without asking sometimes because I know it will be great My father born and bred in Italy considers this place the most authentic Italian in New York I know it s far uptown but trust me it s worth it 
1bvxWr0Azue1RBWpQr5aQQ Columbia OMG one of the most terrible dining experiences I ve ever had I stopped by here after seeing the high ratings on my yelp mobile I was craving good Caribbean food and didn t have the time to head all the way to Queens or Brooklyn I walked in and was barely greeted by the waiter cashier After looking at the menu I decided on a lunch special and got the brown stewed chicken rice and peas and candied yams I decided on the stewed chicken because being Caribbean myself I figured that it was a dish that would be hard to mess up As I got my food two other women walked in and were clearly really excited to try this place They asked me what I had ordered and were going over the menu saying ooh this looks good or maybe I should try that Then the waiter came over to them and very unenthusiastically asked if they were ready to order One of the women looked at this stunning example of poor customer service and said Are you tired He said No I m not She said sweetly Oh because you re dragging your feet I got the clue that she was saying that his service sucked but he looked at her indignantly said Well ma am I have a lot of steps to make in a day I do a lot of walking around okay I was disgusted by his attitude and by my nasty ass brown stewed chicken and overly sweet candied yams that I took three bites of and couldn t even bring myself to finish I packed it to go but threw it in the garbage bin on the corner Never again 
1cI3g2d-c5QzhwkxMPHl4Q Columbia Nathaniel B you are right on track Radio is the Columbia U hangout especially on Thursday night when Teachers College goes bad Drink specials and spirited bartenders make this a nice place to be a regular This past week things mixed up like a 5 ingredient cocktail The lights in the front part of the bar went down and the DJ mic went way up He said I didn t come ALL the way up here for nuthin and really rocked it out with hip hop spanning the ages Fun crowd that stays around the front bar and sometimes spills onto the outdoor patio Drink specials are something else on Thursday night Word to the wise it s loud 
1cItm7l_NkUlfmdooHG6Cw Columbia Not my go to sandwich shop I often feel as though I try new things only to be disappointed and I try old stand by options only to find them a little bland or dry I know they re in a hurry and move people though the line with speed but the food is not all that great If you want a comparable sandwich for the same price go to M2M For all the people with offices on the Amsterdam side of the block keep eating at HamDel so you don t add to the M2M line 
1cnLJiHUCd9uFKwfxwM8tw Columbia not your average gyro i love lamb Hooda takes the time to make sure the pita is perfectly warm and pliable then puts on just enough lettuce and tomato for freshness not just taking up space from the meat the meat i like freshly shaved Donner lamb but for this gyro he shaved it and throws it on the flattop with special sauce and a few other treats like carrots for natural sweetness Flavors meld and meat crisps jus a bit more before he loads it on to the awaiting pita so good and just 4 
1CXoy7kB3WgX54osZvjnFg Columbia I love French food and Le Monde is decent I went here for lunch on a weekday and the service was quick I started with a cheese plate and their Roquefort was so good The other cheese not so much I had a steak frites for lunch My boyfriend had the croque monsieur Croque monsieur was underwhelming Steak frites was ok I asked for medium and it was pretty much well done Will I go back Probably not 
1cY9XJAnWx9p_w8QhzFhhw Columbia We came here for dinner and ordered savory dinner crepes The staff was helpful answering questions and making recommendations The food came out promptly and was delightful A nice touch was when the waiter split our dessert for us I ll be back for sure 
1d1EBPOmw2rQ82-JmWlJCQ Columbia When I go here I get the same thing every time The red velvet cake which I think is tasty Not the best I ve ever had but it satisfies my sweet tooth if I m having a craving I did try the cupcakes You can def pass on those Crumbs is much better Much When you go its best to get the same thing you ususally get because you don t want to keep going and trying different thing cuz then it begins to become a hit or miss kind of place Pick a cake and stick to it 
1DEWEze0ZhUQLgIridn5PA Columbia This place makes excellent sandwiches I would say that they are expensive but compared to other Columbia U area sandwich purveyors the pricing is standard while the quality of the ingredients is much much higher They have some really excellent multigrain rolls lots of nice cheeses and many creative daily sandwiches The only downside really is that the line is long but it tends to move quite quickly and it s worth the wait 
1DgZ9TXsx_2OIL6lE8XpnA Columbia I used to hate this place but now I m a convert They ve really improved in the last year It s not the cheapest place in the neighborhood but it s open airy clean and friendly They do a decent manicure of course it depends on who you get I like Eilean and a good pedicure They ve dropped the habit of trying to upsell you on every little thing and then pretending not to understand you when you say no one of the things I used to loathe about them And the chair massages are really wonderful I ve been going there regularly since I ve been heavily pregnant and they are always very accommodating and patient with me helping me adjust the chair until I m comfortable Those chairs are VERY adjustable so if you re not comfortable tell them This is not some anemic half assed patting session like you get at some other places These girls are strong and they know how to get to your trouble spots What really impresses me is how friendly they are They don t try to chat you up during your services but they ll talk to you if you initiate and they are very helpful with things like putting on shoes getting your coat on your keys out post manicure etc They are also very kind to babies If you ve got a baby in tow and you don t want to hire a sitter just to squeeze in a quick pedi during naptime the ladies here are very accommodating and they seem to love babies These are the things you notice when you get knocked up My one pet peeve is that they all have name tags with what cannot possibly be their real names There is not one Asian name in the whole joint apparently their parents all gave them cliche American names like Sally or Tammy Girl please Your name is not Sally Are New York women really that stupid that we can t call someone by their given name just because it happens to be Korean or Taiwanese or Vietnamese We have to be fed some fake white bread American name because we can t say Chih Chen or Xiaoping Gimme a break Just tell me your name and give me a chance Accepts credit cards but tips in cash only 
1dMXOmeugqY2xEdTZk96RA Columbia A very contemporary space with open windows a sleek bar an open kitchen and lots of orange colored accents Concept wise the restaurant wins boasting fresh seasonal local produce along with certification of being green Unfortunately the food doesn t always live up to Clinton St Bakery expectations and the menu is somewhat pricey for the portion size Juice bar is also very pricey I stopped in on my way to class and coughed up 7 for a regular smoothie Still although the price point definitely puts it out of range for most students it hasn t stopped the place from being packed every night thus far I suppose Community would be better if they had better service The first hosts hostesses were awfully rude and unaccommodating which was kind of understandable during its opening hijinks but not so much now Months later hostesses are still rude and waiters remain nonchalant and inattentive with little knowledge of what s on the menu I ve been about three or four times since and while the food has gotten better at times even crave worthy the entire dining experience is always a little sour 
1DPjKYIgS4NxcGeWNeKFZQ Columbia The food is good Nothing amazing Their chilli sauce is good but I always feel sick after eating Service is awful They simply dont care about you 
1Du6L-9XQaEpEyQzIeDTZw Columbia Solid place Nice atmosphere good food good date spot Prices are reasonable service is fine 
1dVmrGsEbOtUw8oyqSHS1A Columbia I have never had five guys so I wanted to try it out when it moved into my neighborhood The difference between the Little and the regular burger is the patties The little comes with one patty and the regular comes with two I got the little as that is usually how many patties I eat I also had the cajun fries which are the same price as the regular fries but come with seasoning The price is comparable to Shake Shack so not the cheapest but moderately priced The two patties is more expensive than one obviously and you will pay for it Total price for two people was about 20 sharing the fries and the drink I ordered the little hamburger and added mushrooms lettuce tomatoe and mustard ketchup I forgot the pickles The burger tasted good but the bun wasnt as toasted as I would like and got soaggy quickly I like that you can add the toppings you would like though The fries were good with the seasoning but could use more crunch Overall I enjoyed my burger but this is not my favorite burger place in New York Will come back if I am around and in the mood though Place is popular with all though and are usually busy but plenty of seating to be had Not a place you go to for ambiance but for convenience and a burger 
1dw1CCiG76YiXbf-uQF6Pg Columbia My homegirls and I had a great boozy brunch at Lido s The service was excellent and the unlimited mimosas were poured generously and with a smile My friends refered to them as light skinned mimosas since they are light on the OJ heavier on the champs My food was just okay I had the omelet with rock shrimp which was had three little shrimp pebbles in it It was served with greens and was a little bit boring nothing I couldn t whip up at home I know that I chose my entree poorly because all of my friends food looked and smelled so much better than mine I snuck a taste of the pasta with veal meatballs which was absolutely amazing I d recommend that For dessert we shared chocolate buddino Oh my sweet and salty heaven I m not usually a mouse pudding person but I loved that buddino to the point I wished I had my own portion All the servers were really nice I was pleasantly surprised that the service was so efficient after reading some of the yelp reviews Our waiter was charming and attentive We were allowed to linger and enjoy our meal and even when they needed our table the welcomed us to hang out at the bar My overall experience was pretty good I d say give it a try 
1dxFIT-m5u_624d9Lhy0_g Columbia The view is nice but the food was only average The lunch specials are priced right and will certainly fill you up 
-KILDsHnjq-QZkXt3BThWw Harvard I have no idea how many times I ve been to Tosci s but I ve probably been there almost 10 times over the past 4 years The ice cream is a bit on the expensive side but you can always find a good flavor and it s a worthy treat I particularly like the hydrox cookie but I usually sample their sorbets and get one whenever I go 
-KJPx5Ylen7vD417hXiJRg Harvard I walked past this place nearly every day for two years and somehow never managed to notice it What the So we re wandering around the Square after seeing Salt at the AMC and get a sudden urge for sushi I think crap Shabu Ya is my only option no offense Shabu Ya but you do shabu better than sushi then decide to quickly Yelp it Lo An actual sushi place Sold The sushi itself maki actually can t remember the names but we got three different ones was nothing to write home about but it was super fresh at least and I enjoyed my green tea I think I should ve chosen my rolls better which I will do next time I m in Harvard Square and in need of some sushi Also is this place really BYO They 
-kk4Mkrh7OhSITwaMHNp1g Harvard I agree zero stars Bought a Groupon as a gift and it turned out you needed to submit insurance info before booking an appointment and they needed to talk to your company but Steam Sport never answered and so we weren t able to book an appointment before the Groupon expired Groupon said no refund but that we could use the cost 99 towards another appointment with Steam Sport but they ve gone out of business And I read here in Yelp that it went out of business before the Groupon expired Explains why we couldn t get any answer from them Hoping Groupon reconsiders and refunds 
-kMl9mda-o0bOpRM66N0GA Harvard Good place for cheap fast ethnic food They serve meat and veggies and decent falafel Not much place to sit more of a take away fast food joint reminiscent of Maos in Barcelona They re open til 3 am on the weekends so perfect for post boozing munchies There s a minimum for credit cards 
-KOMTvCGGJQ1DGRd-S3cpg Harvard This place is small and best suited for take out only but oohhhh the food is so worth it I had a lamb roll up and it was to DIE FOR The prices are reasonable too They only take cash but don t worry there are about 10 ATMs around the corner to choose from Definitely recommended for a late night snack after a night of drinking 
-KOzZqge0avDKTOjJllaeQ Harvard Shortly after I joined Groupon one popped up for Think Tank so I went for it I finally got around to going there with my girlfriend last week on date night and it was fairly disappointing First off we went in at 7pm on Friday night and it was maybe half full This was not the most auspicious sign for a place in Kendall Sq but not a dealbreaker The decor was somewhat spare although they did have a working photobooth at least it was working until two young girls took too much advantage of it The music was 70 s 80 s lounge which was a plus although it was also much too loud We each ordered beers which were reasonably priced at 5 50 on draft For an appetizer we got the crispy pork belly It was tasty and a little bit crispy but I think I was expecting a little more wow from it the gf loved it though For main course I ordered the Seoul burger and gf ordered the Ramen The Seoul burger seems to be their signature dish but it didn t blow me away I ordered it medium but there wasn t even a hint of pink inside The egg is a great touch the bun is tasty and the horseradish aioli was nice The meat wasn t anything to write home about and all in all I d say it was a decent burger but maybe not a 10 burger Plus the sweet potato fries were quite limp The ramen was alright but again not that impressive If you re going to put what is typically college survival food on the menu you should give it some pizzazz and the roasted root vegetables tried to but didn t succeed For dessert we were excited about the State Fair dessert cotton candy caramel apple and funnel cake but the cotton candy machine was broken Disheartened and overall disappointed in an over priced but average ly tasting meal we gave up Service was good our waitress was highly attentive perhaps overly so at times I thought she was going to plop down and join us but I think part of this was due to the lack of busy ness in the restaurant Overall if I lived down the street from Think Tank I might go occasionally for a drink but the food isn t good enough to merit the prices and the trek there 
-KPF3dWBx7-6m8ZC04YDpg Harvard I love this little shop first of all the Yak t shirt is a must have if you like cartoon yaks as I do Great clothing wonderful jewelery great books and Buddhist items I feel like I m visiting an old friend every time I go in to the shop and I d like more people to feel the same 
-kpwgWc9W70r3aX-Jnd-Rw Harvard Based on the mostly good reviews on here I decided to try this new spot for lunch today Before I could even finish my lunch I was compelled to post about what is possibly the WORST chicken parm sub I have ever had Actually up the street at ABC Pizza they make theirs with processed nugget style chicken so they might win that one Seriously these chicken cutlets are so dry and tough I can only imagine that they ve been sitting out for a very long time days maybe and then reheated In fact I almost want to laugh at them for actually trying to pass these leathery chicken artifacts off as food Mediocre bread sauce and cheese round out this disappointing trashworthy lunch And by trashworthy I mean I literally threw 60 of it in the trash 
-KqhcmoKIheAMeDXeNG-lA Harvard Holy Sweet Jesus I worship at the cheesey foot of the Nokes My coworker Matty B and I used to order a full size Nokes pizza every Sunday afternoon and we would waste no time in inhaling the entirety of it s seductive cheesey and meaty goodness Nokes pizza is thick extravagant and not incredibly greasy It will make you weep out of sheer joy 
-kr660OxPpF4MvVUnesdsQ Harvard This brand new counter service eatery is definitely worth stopping by Delicious food made with attention will cost you a bit less than it should The people at the restaurant were really nice and appreciative of our business However you should probably make sure you ve got a few minutes to kill it took them about 15 minutes to prep our lunch with no other customers inside They feature a bunch of lavash ish wraps in typical middle eastern style falafel shwarma hummus etc with lettuce tomato pickle and tahini The wraps are dirt cheap under 5 right now for a vegetarian option and 5 7 for meat The wraps are also delicious and they will even serve them to you out of the wrap and plated if you ask nicely There are some other plated options mostly configurations of the above items which we ll have to go back to try These are a bit more expensive but are still less than 10 The reason the wraps were so tasty was because the food was clearly cooked to order a mixed bag at a place with counter service You expect the food to come out quick so when you re sitting waiting and listening to the falafel fry in the kitchen it can be a little discouraging However it was totally worth the wait I think this also might be due to the fact that this place is new I bet they ll iron out some kinks and maybe raise the prices once things start moving along It s a nicely decorated restaurant with pop middle eastern music playing at a reasonable volume The dude behind the counter went above and beyond in terms of taking care of us although we ordered at the counter we basically got table service to the point where we decided to leave a tip If everybody has as nice a time as we did Viva will do just fine 
-KrgTHXmDsDWm1JIRbrteA Harvard Sweet gets a stellar review due to it s tiny but bursting with flavor cupcakes that can be delivered to your home I received 16 cupcakes of Sweet s flavors as a housewarming gift A very nifty idea from my best friend It does not get 5 stars due to their limited flavors wish they had more They do have a thick rich glob of icing if your a fan but when you bite into one of these it s one of those moments you look around and moan and wonder if heaven is this good 
-KRjMAqpvjgVuJ9syyMqhQ Harvard After seeing all the reviews and raves from friends this place was just a setup for bitter disappointment however I love it when my cynicism proves to be wrong Atmosphere Sat evening got there 30 mins early to get drinks as expected no hope of getting seated earlier Bar is TINY the restaurant is tucked away behind minimalist decor but cozy Part of cozy though are tight spaces just to warn you We were seated only 5 mins after our reservation Sound level perfect for conversation This place is great for date or small groups Friend had requested a specific table setup before we had arrived and it was nicely accommodated Service Spot on friendly and helpful bartender and waiters Drinks I drove so mocktails for me only 65 a good ginger beer not much taste of the grenadine or cucumber though 44 Minty lemony goodness loved it No complaints from friend about beer and bourbon selections Food Yes the two of us ate all of this we know how to throw it down Plus the portion sizes are just right that somehow I didn t feel ill afterwards Bread Average Corn Bread w Sorghum Butter Crispy w a slightly syrup soaked texture in a good way very dessert like and small so it was befitting as an appetizer sorghum butter has a great finish Deviled Eggs Had the approval of native Virginian friend who is a prolific deviled egg eater Uh how can anything topped with crisp bacon be bad Nuff said Seafood Charcuterie Excellent scallops good amt of acid shrimp a tad overcooked white fish salad on crostini was decent tasted like food reminiscent from a Jewish meal Pork late This is the reason why I could never do Kosher Very sweet but yummy rib and a bomb ass pork belly most of the bomb ass ness attributed to the crisp skin the fatty part could have been better if slightly firmer but whatever I could have eaten a plate of that stuff regardless Shrimp and Grits Creamy but slightly overcooked I would say not as good as purported but tasty Cornmeal Catfish Perfectly crisp outside w o being greasy moist on inside Dirty rice yummy and light Roasted Pear Bourbon Ice Cream Cake Uh ice cream cake yes please Not a huge fan of the pears but they were not overwhelming and overall still a winner Peach Tart w Tarragon Ice Cream Warm gooey inside crisp top Wished the peach were sweeter but friend liked it just the way it was Tarragon ice cream was surprisingly pleasant and refreshing would definitely buy a tub if they made it At end of meal they gave us little tiny bites of chocolate w peanuts and oats a pleasing last bite Overall Food 4 stars but bump up to 5 for really lovely staff service and overall dining experience Will def be back for their 10PM menu that they have on Fri and Sat nights 
-ktIWStweLJ-W7QmYln3kg Harvard Oooh Korean Wings Sounds tasty In fact they are pretty good But there are some pretty big problems from being top drawer First I love me some spicy wings but there s gotta be something to calm yourself down No ranch or anything yes I realize this is a Korean restaurant However I m sure there must be some Korean equivalent I guess there was some cole slaw or what I think is actually kimchi but it didn t do that great of a job And of course the pickles LOL I m chuckling as I write this Its almost preposterous as to how this restaurant could serve this piece of shit Literally though it smelled like crap No I m not insane because as we took the leftovers home a lady on the bus noted how it smelled like death There isn t even a fictional smell from a Harry Potter potion that could rival how crappy this thing smelled I m glad no one realized the smell was coming from our Bon Chon bag otherwise we might have gotten kicked off the bus Stay away from the pickles otherwise the other things are pretty good 
-kygInYXIjYmFFiH4UaJrw Harvard This place is jumpin but the coffee isn t amazing and it s hard to find a seat sometimes The dessert food pastries and whatnot are really tasty though 
-KYnmT-8yCsHk-ugv0DxDQ Harvard I m so happy to have a wine shop like this near me Finally The staff is so friendly and helpful and they have such a great wine selection I was practically jumping up and down not sure what I should take home first It s clear that they focus on smaller less known producers that are more often organic and biodynamic I left with three bottles of wine that are hard to find and had great value so I didn t break the bank I ve been recommending this place to all my wine loving friends since Did I mention they have great cheese that they can pair with your wine I ll be back very soon 
-L-hMOLK5E29bwwitCrVyA Harvard Best Ice Cream Ever It would get 5 stars but they don t always have my fave which is the mint It isn t the processed mint that you would find in say mint choc chip ice cream But a pure mint herb ice cream that is killer Ok so maybe I am a little too harsh on docking a star but I love it so yeah Anywho they have plenty of bomb flavors to try coffee is always a go to my girl loves the almond one I think it s almond butter hydrox is also top notch Whatever your taste buds are like refined or not you will leave here with a smile on your face 
-l11nYYWnyB8E941RYCnfw Harvard Had the same experience as LF Made the appt she cancelled without notice rescheduled didn t show didn t call didn t return call nothing Unprofessional and ridiculous 
-L2NF7I2kd3oBLi3DhJIDA Harvard Lord or Hobo Last night I went with friends to Lord Hobo aka the resting place of B Side Lounge and we were all very confused for what they are trying to go for On the one hand the lights are bright gone are the cozy booths of B side to be replaced with uncomfortable high top tables and backless stools and a bunch of flat screen tv s playing sports Ok so looking around you think this is a dive sports bar Then the menu comes with admittedly creative but expensive entr es starting at 20 What the what If I want to spend 20 an entr e I want an atmosphere to match like Oleana or Dante but with dive sports bar atmosphere I need a huge plate of nachos for 6 and 3 drafts What Lord Hobo has is a major identity crisis Maybe that s what the weird name is all about Lord prices with a hobo atmosphere Not sure who they are trying to appeal to The crowd seemed to be inherited b side hipsters not the frat boys who might be into watching sports on the flat screen tv s Well good luck lord hobo and working out your identity issues I won t be back The whole experience just made miss B side more tear Peace out girl scouts 
-l8tS7frVrdoYwBXuH_j-g Harvard Ok you pinball junkies and DDR addicts I am the dark messenger sent to inform you that the MIT game room has been closed for at least a year now It was a glorious place in its time of operation A place where the Dance Dance truly felt like a Revolution sweaty engineering students from Korea busting their asses on the pink and blue squares for citywide domination Bust a Move for all you dragon bubble loving motherfuckers I utilized this spot for my intense training for Sopranos the Pinball Game as an amateur during my stint as an office fuck years 2006 2008 But my dears it is gone and with it a slice of the heart of Kendall Square When they took the game room out of the MIT student center I felt like my dog had died Now I rock some remedial gameage at Flat Top Johnnies up the road but like Wu Tang said Can it be that it was all so simple then Fucking Laverde s Market still rules though 
-LA3sXbqT5D3piKexzxcvg Harvard This place was the very first business I patronized when I got to Cambridge I got lost trying to find the place when I was a newbie its kind of in a non ideal location it d be better if One Kendall Square area was built up a little more I like the design of the theater except for the roundabout bathroom access I like the eclectic selection of films usually although I sometimes wish they had at least a couple mainstream movies running but that s more of a convenience thing for me They re still a chain but by the standards of most franchise locations they don t suck nearly as much The tickets are still absurdly expensive and they don t offer student discounts on weekends Lame The snacks are also super expensive but at least they ll give you tap water and have an interesting selection of snacks and different popcorn flavorings 
-lDxXHNUNrwWUFnvnL_WSQ Harvard I read the reviews out of curiosity and then remembered it has been waaay too long since my last visit to Cuchi Cuchi Walk in and be instantly charmed by the art deco glam craziness oh and the excellent food and drinks The tuna tartar avocado mousse cornets are mind blowing It is a bit expensive but the more people in your group the better to sample all the dishes I came here one night with about 10 people and I think we got one of everything off the menu and it was all great The brie en croute is the stuff dreams are made of 
-lFULu5cE0N3OFpnWxWhZQ Harvard VIM you are great You re clean swanky and when your classrooms are not in use you provide me with a huge dark cold oasis in which to sweat balls and sing aloud to Eminem s Lose Yourself on my Shuffle Ways in which you are not winning a Your staff read front desk workers not instructors are fairly soulless and I really hate being greeted or more often not greeted by these people when coming in the door b You are ALWAYS out of towels in the women s bathroom You re a gym There should be someone down there every 1 2 hr making sure we have adequate supplies If it weren t for those two things even with your high prices you would be 5 stars So hire better staff and give me enough terry cloths to shower Please 
-LmfVI9lc0Vm3vCVfnNpDw Harvard last week i hit up the middle east to watch a friend play a show good venue decent bar and ample room can t complain i ve seen numerous shows and have always had a good time there my gf also does belly dance shows there so i gotta show them some love 
-lN9xJo7fBJO1Bp9pOzdUw Harvard My FAVE I will always find an excuse to go to this place Delicious and affordable And unlimited chips and salsa while you look through the menu The shrimp and crawfish quesadilla is highly recommended It s just under 9 but i ALWAYS have leftovers The only bad thing about this place is that it can get super crowded but usually only on friday and saturday nights 
-LoAgdch4sDoI3S0HBbXFg Harvard Not a bad anime store as anime stores go The location is good though it s obvious that the store is too small for all their stuff Every inch of this place is packed with merchandise I do like the fact they have an entire wall of action figures and that they carry most of the Square Enix Final Fantasy line even the really new ones last time I was there I spotted anime style FF7 Cloud and Tifa who are fairly new releases Also they ve got a decent selection of cold cast figurines The manga and CD selection could use some work and I can t really comment on the legitimacy of most of their CDs from what I saw a lot of them were from Taiwan but again I understand space is an issue Surprisingly they had a lot of goods from less popular or older series so if you re looking for goods from your favorite anime from 1999 I would say give Tokyo Kid a try 
-LopP23CSYbJ_JogN94Qzg Harvard Totally don t understand the hate for this place Four friends and I headed here for Restaurant Week and it was fan freaking tastic All five of us got the all fondue version of the three course meal and I was really impressed The Swiss cheese fondue appetizer was perfectly executed gooey cheese not too salty with an interesting assortment of things to dip in the cheese The highlight for me was their potato wedges really crispy and perfectly balanced against the cheese The main course was probably the weakest of the three but seriously it s chunks of meat that you cook in delicious broth and then dip into things still a pretty high baseline of awesomeness The beef and shrimp were both very high quality meat and the broth we got the French broth which has mushrooms and beef stock and some other spicing that the vegetable broth doesn t was excellent My only complaint was with the sauces which were a little boring Dessert was knee weakening Conversation which had been lively and animated until that point stopped dead in its tracks when that chocolate concoction appeared I ve never seen a group of people tear through a spread of food as quickly as we did The chocolate was perfect and the assortment of things to put in the chocolate including chocolate brownies which created a level of chocolate y ness that I m sure is illegal in most states was great With a nice bottle of the house white which our server recommended and which was really quite good and not at all expensive though if you want to spend some money on a bottle of red boy have you come to the right place this was an outstanding dinner Service was a little slow but that s probably because the place was packed to the gills and it actually worked out well because I ate an entire meal s worth of cheese as an appetizer and needed the extra time to make room for dessert I d definitely come back for another Restaurant Week and I m curious enough about the standard menu that I might come back later this fall 
-LoxpWppPauyHEZI0_3eaQ Harvard Adorable shop pleasant staff decent cupcakes I got the lemon blueberry and it was a little dry especially considering it was a more muffiny flavor I expected more moisture The frosting was delicious better than the cupcake the perfect balance of sweet creamy and a hint of acid from the lemon 
-lQBgXG6qrd7Bt6pL2OUKg Harvard I ll review the Pheonix for it s lunchtime cuisine I hit this place up during the week on my lunch break The waitresses almost always change and there is almost always the guy having bud for lunch sitting at the bar The burgers buff chicken sand steak and cheese and nachos are all pretty good They also serve smithwicks which you can t find many places get it with a guinness head just sounds cool The place has totally different dive feel during the day compared to the night Why wait in line at the Miracle when you can go to the Pheonix 
-lS6WGMH6UCefN3yzHlrQg Harvard The warm beet salad with goat cheese was delicious and much larger than expected The steak was a little salty as were the frites but sometimes salty is delicious While the cocktails may be on the expensive side our vodka sodas were large and strong Service Not bad but not particularly good either 
-lu7PY03fTGwQPQhCbtPGw Harvard I m a fan of this studio because a it s centrally located and very convenient b there is enough variety of teachers and classes to always fit something into my schedule c although I have my own personal preference for some of the instructors in general they are all consistently good d hot yoga has been a wonderful way to improve my overall health and appearance I m not a fan of this studio because a the classes can get REALLY crowded and although some instructors helpfully tell people to align their mats in a more neighbor minded way sometimes there is complete chaos and disorder and this makes it very challenging to focus on my practice especialy when someone is waving their arms in front of you b the studio lets people join the class late and classes doesn t always start on time this can also be frustrating I used to belong to a studio in FL where they locked the doors at the start of class and I thought this went well with the discipline Other notes the music classes vary A LOT according to the instructor s personal musical preferences 
-lYsnL0C_K6AZguFQbxv8Q Harvard Wooo this was such a convenient place to eat It s right in Harvard square I went in early Sat morning and classes just started for the undergrads so that may be why it was somewhat empty Can t speak for how it gets later in the year I had an omelette which comes with home fries and toast 8 They had some fancy stuffed french toast for their specials too but I was in a more savory mood Omelettes were not fancy or anything standard not ridiculously stuffed but I enjoyed it Service was chill and they were very nice Place is a strip of booth chairs so come with a small crowd or avoid a crowd altogether If this place was hard to get to I wouldn t necessarily come back but I like that it s relativel cheap and in harvard square with decent food that fulfills my breakfast needs 
-LyXEEMCB-zP6zWBnkrOmw Harvard I would love to offer sweet a higher review but their delicious little treats are often inconsistent in quality At times the cake would be perfectly moist and fluffy yet other times rock hard and almost inedible I do love how their cake is never too sweet so it compliments really well with their frosting I usually get the red velvet but the strawberry shortcake is pretty good and I have heard rave reviews from Tracy C about the carrot one That being said I do love how they decorated the space and how it s a fantastic place to sit mid afternoon to just people watch while taking a break from the busy harvard square neighborhood 
-lzMrX4AX0XUo0WF-AM-NA Harvard Ick Just ick I wasn t expecting anything great and I m pretty forgiving as far as cheap food goes not a picky eater at all But this was far far beyond what even I could stomache It was greasy to the point of being oily and tasted like sweet rancid chicken broth Judging from the other reviews I m guessing this place has some okay or even good dishes and some really horrible ones I ordered pad thai I m too blind to read the descriptions on the menu ahead of time and went with the first thing I recognized But even if their other dishes are gourmet quality they only get a single star from me if you can t cook something well don t put it on your menu 
-LZuNEYabbUGmuzHDIa5GQ Harvard Hit or miss but isn t all record shopping This place is pretty disorganzied with tons of records on lower shelves below the main alphabitized ones It s the kind of place you should have an hour or so to kill in You can come across rare wax everyonce in a while but what it s really good for is to pick up that Stones record you ve been missing for a few bucks They have a lot of popular stuff cheep Also the clerks their are not the typical music snobs they won t roll their eyes at you if you walk to the counter with a well known pop record 
-L_epZY2ChD9xsIfbbd4tQ Harvard Great green gooey lord they have the garlic sauce that I have missed ever since Ararat in Watertown closed down a couple years ago ASK FOR IT It can probably make anything taste better ice cream croque en bouche mandoo navratan korma baklava Hamburger Helper you name it I bet that garlic sauce improves the taste You could spread it on your arm and try to absorb the nutrition through your skin The guy who runs the place is so nice that I don t want to think about the kinda dried out chicken shawarma You know what I don t care They have friggin amazing garlic sauce They could serve shoe leather sandwiches but I d probably not notice the garlic sauce is that good 
-M0hgQwq31jEjol9XQ6DeQ Harvard Hey this place is great it s DEFINETLY a whole lot cleaner and organized since my first time here First time well I felt like I was at a hippie commune type place like they were growing everything out back and just dumping produce everywhere But I was in my vegan phase and certain food is hard to come by when on a restricted regimen Whole Foods at the time bread and circus was limited with locations I was into sprouting and such so I was all over this place regardless of it s funky smell Flash forward to 07 Wow overhaul Good and bad The whole idea of a coop is to join the group and reap the benefits while the local providers prevailed Apparantly economics of that business model has produced a seemingly Whole Foods spin off Not so cheap but still quality The cafe is quite decent too I perhaps overlooked it but there used to be an area in the personal products where you could blend your own mixes by bulk it was awesome carrier oils essential oils creams it was such a bang for da buck Didn t look for it so perhaps it s still there but it was a pretty large part of personal care so doubt it Since I m all over organic now I will continue to pull this into my mix of shopping As a whole I think perusing the isles inspires me for new and different tastes in an otherwise bland healthy eating world Oh and by the way there is an indian shop next door that has some BAD ASS spices at wee costs Plan a Saturday afternoon and just go nuts 
-M1HHBL_e5nluhfxrupcvA Harvard Great beer list Had appetizers of vegetarian chili nachos yum calamari too small a portion but YUM and the crab cake salad for dinner Then I saw the mice Same night as the other reviewer apparently running around and across the dining room as the sun went down Mentioned to the waitress and she said Oh where Told her ummmmm right there me pointing and she said she d take care of it Really dude 
-M1rgYnaoGC82VEta1gdsg Harvard average tasting above average healthy pizza for astronomical prices but they let you pre order online which is very cool especially for busy families the margherita pizza is very disappointing and plain despite the fresh basil leaves pepperoni lover s pizza is fine though the amount of toppings is quite sparse It all tastes fine and being able to order whole wheat crust earns the bonus star to 3 because the prices are just too high THEY DON T ACCEPT DISCOVER CARD 
-m34mMTnjOtu6YDwsYm6cA Harvard I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing Toscanini s is When I was at a summer camp in Boston I literally came to Toscanini s five times a week which was absolutely terrible for my wallet but Toscis is SO good Gah I cannot even fathom how delicious it is My usual was the Vienna Finger Cookie since it was the perfect Vanilla and those Vienna Finger Cookies were also mixed in for ultimate deliciousness My friend was a huge fan of the Burnt Caramel which I found a bit too melty for me since I like my ice cream to be nice and solid The hydrox options especially the Coffee Hydrox is also phenomenal Hydrox is essentially Tosci s fancy way of saying Oreos It s definitely on the pricey side but that s why you buy it in pints I know that sounds really fattening but trust The pint is such a good deal Just grab two flavors with a friend and share the pint I can t even understand how there s so much awesome in one pint of ice cream I would honestly go here everyday if I lived in Boston and could afford it Tosci s is also a very chill place to hang out at in general I ve never really tried any of the cafe food but the flavors are just so amazing The other great thing is that the flavors constantly rotate which always keeps things interesting tldr best ice cream in america truth 
-m3rQwS1ncMouMiV9u-leQ Harvard Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh THAT s what a falafel wrap is supposed to taste like 
-m4J91Vs0HMHRpmVTcWbPA Harvard The first time I walked past Xylem it was closed but the sleek modern interior caught my eye I finally got to visit the store a few weeks ago and I fell in love small shops like this one that carry cutesy geek chic items are right up my alley I think I may like Xylem a little more than Black Ink on Charles Street Last time I visited Black Ink I could barely walk around the store because it s so cramped and none of the customers were polite enough to move aside I find Xylem to be more spacious and vibrant I also love that they have great SALES the last of which I definitely took advantage of several times 
-m5n0PZVgrhSAaQUgTBzng Harvard Fancy place The food was very good but only small portions Also very pricy What was interesting during the evening three of us got a Toronto and its taste alcohol content and the amount served vast differed in each case I was lucky and got the most alcohol and also the largest amount this was good Also tried the two other drink and at least one was not good We talked to them about it but it was not properly fixed They did not offer to replace the drink 
-m73irTk1N5IQCcUdFTreQ Harvard The only good thing about this place was the waitress She was sweet and attentive though not mind blowingingly good I can t believe how crappy the rest of the experience was My friends and I had reservations for days and were really looking forward to it But then we are being walked past dirty empty tables and were brought to a booth shoved in the corner of the back exit with no light and a sticky table I kindly asked for a new table and was initially told no but then I asked again and said we d be willing to wait The host went and got another hostess who walked back and said we could but we d have to wait 30 minutes despite that fac that were were only a few people in line and SO many tables just dirty and waiting to be bussed So we got stuck sitting in the darkest corner booth imaginable by an area where they store stuff just terrible And the food was awful Our vegetables weren t cooked because they didn t steam them at all so thanks for the luke warm pasta and hard broccoli really worth the money Just not worth the time seriously 
-m8459G3bLPxHhWEbXQQbg Harvard Best lattes I ve had in Boston this is barista dependent of course so look for Ben a bit more training of their baristas could go a long way I am a picky espresso person and am incredibly thankful that this shop is on my morning commute 
-mAZVO-oRhYx2KPD5CnTrw Harvard Harvard Square seriously lacks in cheap brunch places and I was ecstatic when I discovered this place Extremely reliable for a very QUICK sit down breakfast Never a line on the weekdays From start to finish breakfast will take you 45 minutes tops so it s a great place to come before class I usually get the hash eggs with coffee and it comes to 11 with tax and tip I ve also ordered the cheese blintzes as well as the California benedict instead of ham there s avocado both of which are delicious They also have a large selection of very inventive omelettes although I m not a big fan of eggs so I ve never tried them Their portions are large and you d have to be very hungry to finish it all They also keep the coffee cup full Awesome The only reason I ve docked them one star is because their food isn t out of this world by any means Just some good filling brunch that doesn t leave me feeling like I m about to have a heart attack Love the ambiance too Colorful large booths and very spacious retro atmosphere Lots of window seating rare in Boston with natural light I also love how you can sit there sipping coffee long after you ve paid the bill without feeling any pressure from the staff to leave I ll definitely keep coming as a regular 
-Mc2_Avfu7Rc-kXNotC4sA Harvard Great burgers and fries Haven t tried the shakes yet The workers could be smarter The last one messed up my order a bit but they are still nice I like this place more than the nearby mr Bartley s It Is cheaper and good qualit Definitely go if you re in the square 
-MFc_A1sFi1lUx3E1qyFdg Harvard This is a fun place to visit I know i said visit and it s a store One floor has a bunch of clothes thrown all on the floor and you can go climb in them and root through and shove them in a bag and then you pay by the pound i dont have the patience to find good stuff in that but if you do definitely go take advantage the other floor has partly new costume y stuff and partly old clothes but on hangers this time still it takes tons of effort to go through them and try to find SOMETHING that fits you I ve been a couple times trying to think of what to wear for halloween and i love seeing the weirdo things that people have worn in the past but im not one to sit down with a needle and thread to alter these things and everything is always too big that i like it is a must see store though oh and ps i love the commericals they have on tv garmet district its not a district its a store the garmet district lol 
-mL39ncSTNSrwOPxSeICIQ Harvard I love their burritos I never liked burritos until I came here 
-MlkSMtKgl5F_BnsKpo1lg Harvard Chill laid back atmosphere perfect for a lazy afternoon lunch or dinner I came with 5 others just after the Sunday lunch rush A waiter came up to us and said the big table was about to free up but we could grab drinks at the bar while waiting We sat at the right angle high table and ordered off the periodic table menu of burgers and satays The waiters even have nerdy shorthand to take orders The mimosas are served in regular pint glasses and decently priced considering how much you re getting to get pleasantly buzzed during the day My Ronie burger was stuffed with jalapenos and spicy The fries are really pan fried potato wedges so they might be healthier for you than regular french fries Service was ok Our server was nice and helpful I definitely could ve used a water refill early into my jalapeno burger Nice views of Mass Ave where you can people watch and observe men unicycling down the street 
-MMXfT2o9_yoV4QDG0wyAg Harvard yes Yes YES This place is A mazing and lives up to all the hype that has been generated This place serves southern food that is exhaulted beyond comfort food in fact it ranks up there with last meal status The place is adorable small but larger than you originally think and rather cozy The parking is a bit of a pain but thankfully there is cinema parking right around the corner and they validate woot woot The drink list was short and sweet and so interesting that I couldn t make up my mind on what I wanted to try first They went over my head with the hippest retro ist of liquors so I picked something that sounded delicious that happened to have grapefruit in it I forget the number and can t pull up the menu for some reason but it was good enough that I didn t stray from that cocktail the rest of the evening it was strong yet refreshing and very delicious As it was a group of 6 of us we were able to do some serious carnage on the menu The appitizers we mowed down included the salad the cornbread the clams casino the Grits and the pork confit They were all inhaled and claimed delicious by the table But seriously if you must know the cornbread and grits are a carb lover s dream or nightmare depending on said carb lover s diet situation at the time For our meals again we easily devored more than half the menu with the standouts being the trout w califlower and browned butter melt in my mouth tender with a nutty unctious flavor explosion from the browned butter sauce and the Catfish crispy skin delicious flavors Not to say that the steak chicken and dumplings i e gnocchi and the pork and beans weren t delicious they were We were too full to have an actual solid dessert but managed to force down yet another round of cocktails Service was great my every need was met and I left fully of delicious food and booze 
-MnQ-A0kJ5syzTtb5qTFOw Harvard 3 5 Stars Great New England cuisine They pride themselves on local farmed ingredients and the freshness definitely plays out The food here definitely has a lot of flavors The service was also good Definitely come here Sunday to Thursday for the discounted 3 course menu I have two complaints about this place though First the side rooms are not very well decored like the main room Second the portions on the dishes are inconsistent My girlfriend ordered the Mahi Mahi and it was cheaper and has more food than my dish I ordered the sea scallops for 27 and it has three pieces Note This place is louddddd 
-MotPOe7-FFjcSM4BULqhg Harvard Had the chicken sharawama Holy isht Batman it was amazing AND different flavored fruit Snapples No wai Seriously I m a n00b at Mediterranean food I literally went in there and was like so what do people get OK I ll get that OK yeah sure Uh huh Price is great amount is great large enough glass windows so I can creep on people walking down the sidewalks and not feel like a hamster Yeah so there was a mmm turnip in the wrap Might I warn you that it is AWESOME I m so bleh towards weird sounding vegetables SPINACH Whaaaa but wow Good food So If you ever decide to hit up the List Visual Center this is a perfect place for lunch Seriously You like jammin food down your throat this is a good joint 
-mqrcdBkG7RD3OC5oT71Dg Harvard This is an odd kind of hole in the wall in Kendall Square I had a great pastrami sandwich but it was HUGE and made with three slices of bread Whhaaatt Anyway it was good They have a crazy mixed up selection of things mostly things you shouldn t eat The people who work there are pretty nice too Then again I was there at 5 30pm having missed lunch and breakfast so I was nearly the only person inside 
-mSkS1icyHpGKpBMafaTTg Harvard Came here and splurged a bit on the Chef s Whim 6 course tasting From an amazing amuse bouche of squid noodles to a couple more than satisfying desserts everything was top notch First few were seafood the squid noodles crab scallop then faro pasta hanger steak ice cream and flan a couple macaroons to round out the night Trust the chef he knows what he s doing And he s very generous with the portions we left completely stuffed Waitress was very nice though we did have countless servers throughout the night Tucked away on a side street just behind Toscanini s this place is really a gem Makes me a happy girl 
-mTYHZiNDar95qHnDCnVYw Harvard One of the best cheap lunch spots near MIT a perennial favorite of mine Often crowded but still relatively quick even when there s a big line Once they overcharged me by two dollars and I didn t discover it until I checked my credit card statement weeks later I went back and explained what happened and the guy just gave me the 2 refund on the spot Mistakes happen and he really did the right thing rather than give me a whole story about how I had to have proof etc Good food good people 
-MVe_3lIdTXqAKoXGz2hxA Harvard Al Pastor Burrito for dinner Yes please Delicious and so much better than Ana s not trying to start a war it s my personal opinion The service and staff are so nice and friendly Eating in or taking to go is a pleasure 
-MvFSyPtNModwtU8bMh7Cw Harvard Firstly 10 cash minimum Come prepared Fantastic coffee Fantastic Their well pulled espresso drinks are some of the best I ve had in Cambridge I once indulged in some sort of flavored latte frippery which as a black coffee drinker I admit was a mistake but it was disappointing all the same and expensive to boot While drinks are surprisingly well priced beware a small is an 8 oz espresso size cup I don t mind terribly as I am generally of the opinion that portions are bigger than they need to be but it was surprising the first time around One thing I ve never been disappointed by the food The salads are always fresh have more upscale options berry feta is delicious and are a filling size The pastries are routinely fan freaking tastic and not to be missed Plus the place is beautiful Crema s exposed brick decor with its second floor loft seating is beautiful and welcoming Friends and guests I bring along always coo at its cuteness upon passing the threshold Given its quality and charming decor I have grudgingly accepted that I only ever stand a one in four chance of finding a seat This is fine in the summer but awkward during the winter if I wanted to sit and talk with my companion Truly sad however was my discovery that there is no WiFi in Crema But I guess then seats would be even harder to find so I ll take the trade off 
-mXf_PZjkVklKEPM_lNkpQ Harvard Usually when I think of getting a slip of paper I might be worried about my job but at Voltage it usually means I have some almond y goodness coming my way in the form of the Magpie one of the many unique and delicious lattes on the menu Each latte has it s associated insignia and stamp The stamps are great but its the lattes themselves that makes me want to collect em like Pokemon Once I can get my nose out of my cup I look up to see some awesome art Like any gallery sometimes I can really appreciate it and other times I don t understand it In any case it makes me feel less uncultured Nice place to sit and read study chat Latte excitement also includes sea salt caramel lime agave and cardamom rose water honey all of which are nicely balanced and perfect to sip Food is also a plus A bit pricey but at least the breakfast sandwich was worth it on tasty wholesome grilled bread with a nice spice I think the food options change frequently so be on the lookout 
-myQYUmgzSbdG8ZC1Fl2XQ Harvard The decor of Sweet is very cute and the cupcakes LOOK awesome they just don t taste awesome The frosting on the cupcakes are way too sweet The cake is dry It didn t taste fresh as some other post have mentioned and of course the price I got 2 cupcakes and a pupcake I think it was a bit over 10 
-mZCHg8WzN1CHEX6Xq8A0A Harvard Before a few rounds of pool at FTJs a friend and I wanted to grab a quick dinner On our way over to the nearby brewery we noticed this new place and decided to check out the menu I think we were so blown away by the decor not really in a good way that we didn t notice what exactly was on the menu But in the interest of supporting new small businesses we decided to try it out My friend got a funky salad but I went boring w a burger Our beer battered onion rings were awesome esp with the caper flavored dipping sauce I was excited to learn they were serving white sangria and my friend went with the waiter s suggested raspberry beer Unfortunately that was the end of the positives Half way through her salad my friend realized that the walnuts were cruelly dusted with something really really spicy Neither she nor I could finish it Which was too bad since my burger came out under cooked twice I gave up and they took it off the bill By that time I realized there wasn t really any alcohol in the sangria that I could notice and being a lightweight I would have definitely noticed consuming a glass of wine esp after eating only some onion slices and a few bites of salad I give the waiter credit he did try to make us happy I don t feel we experienced some of the Twilight Zone service some of the other Yelpers have mentioned luckily But I seriously doubt I will be making any effort to return there again soon Last minor gripe for someone with less than perfect vision the menu type is really hard to read 
-n3yV_Xa5f3GZmO5ByKKfA Harvard Overpriced and not impressive I ve only gotten piercings here several years ago and they ve all been pretty poor experiences Stingray Body Art is a much better more professional and less expensive alternative that is 5 minutes away in Allston 
-n70KjLgEwovqh3yr0nzGQ Harvard I tried this place on a Friday night It was suggested by a friend for drinks I d never been and some of the reviews here were good so we tried it out The location was really convenient I happened to drive in but lucked out with a free spot on a side street It s at basement level so its low key and private from the street above We sat outside on the patio area The service was quick and very friendly Good wine and drink selection The server suggested some new summer beers which we tried For appetizers the chicken quesadillas were really packed full of meat and vegetables and were great Around 10 they started moving the tables and to make the dance floor and the music started going and they were charging a cover The crowd was a diverse mix of people mostly in their 20 s I will check this place out again I hear Thursday s are really hopping 
-nadSqTtnbzMgRonS2i-bA Harvard Back East on family business from Portland OR Decided to revisit my favorite lunch place from the 80 s when I lived in Cambridge and worked at MIT Back then Mary s was located across the street and was BYOB Wow The memories flooded back as I enjoyed my old favorites Suan La Chow Show and Dun Dun Noodles I ve found Suan La Chow Show at Chinese restaurants in Arlington and Peabody but they are in a sweet sauce not the delightful spicy one served at Mary s Cash only but moderately priced Topped things off on the way out with a chat with Mary about the old days Chinese restaurant heaven 
-nDKdhV8UXdsxDa-uL8FMQ Harvard I have had a pretty similar experience to all these other reviewer Basically I brought in my favorite shoes to be resoled He told me that it would cost 85 and my shoes weren t really worth it I told him they were my favorite shoes and I wanted them repaired He told me to think about in and get a second opinion End of story Explain to me why I have to talk someone into taking my money I will be going somewhere else to get my shoes repaired 
-nfzivPz8zPD6JA1ocuSnw Harvard Their only claim to fame might be the first indian restaurant in cambridge but they do a good job holdin that title As one of the spicier restaurants I ve ever been to my boyfriend and I LOVE spicy food you can expect good portion sizes not too big but you ll get real full if you do appetizers too and the same waitress who is lovely It is a rather small restaurant that has a comfortable vibe and a huuuuuuuge menu to choose from I adore it but make sure you order enough nan garlic is my fave to cure the spice 
-ngIM2hQkiV7pxnh5TLpgw Harvard I went to see Tricia to try acupuncture for a tweaked neck it was my first time getting acupuncture She made sure I understood what was going to happen showed me the needles briefly went over how it works she was more than willing to elaborate on any areas I had questions about and then asked what my major issue or reason for coming in was All I can say is when I left my neck felt better than it had in a really long time I was thoroughly impressed 
-NHa595461-aT4bnqu2wAA Harvard When I am looking for all those albums by bands in genres that do not have a concrete name I go to Newbury Comics My only problem with this particular branch is they look at you as though you asked them to save the world when you sell some CDs and DVDs back I find that funny because that was a big part of their initial business model Nevertheless it is a wonderful store with tons of stuff you may not need but you REALLY want 
-NHmEzNPa7ykKaE_8EYKjg Harvard A group of five of us went to Rialto for my Birthday Dinner Those of us that arrived early had a drink at the bar while waiting the bartender was very friendly and suggested some very good wines from what we told him we liked He didn t harrass us but made sure we always had what we needed When we got to our table we saw it had been decorated with ribbons and sparkles what a cute touch for my birthday Our waiter Cesar I think it was was beyond fantastic The first thing out of his mouth was we re out of the salmon tonight but it s not very good anyway so you re not missing out There are some way better things He was very laid back and friendly helped us choose dishes and a bottle of wine with ease while recognizing that we weren t high rollers about to spring for the 200 bottles We each got something different and of course shared as 5 girls are wont to do Nobody had a bad meal that s for sure I started out with the parma prosciutto which came with quite a bit of food for the price I was pleasantly surprised Everything was very fresh and flavorful I got the scallops for my big meal and they were absolutely perfect Everyone else s meals were amazing too not one complaint Dessert was so amazing Once again Cesar did a great job explaining everything and giving recommendations We were all stuffed to the gills but just had to try something Mine was brought out with a candle and happy birthday written on it not over the top but really sweet While we ate the head chef came over I recognized her from the website to ask how everything was and wish me a happy birthday She was very personable and sweet very nice The GM also came over more than once to check on us and strike up conversations He and our waiter brought us over some complimentary desserts which we did not need but absolutely devoured and even a few glasses of some amazing dessert wine that we probably wouldn t have otherwise thought about ordering Everyone from the hostesses to the top brass was so friendly and sweet to us what a wonderful way to spend my birthday 
-NjiCaWOlmdUqTbJH_7_XA Harvard On my recent visit to Bank of America I was very pleased with the staff who helped me with a problem with a checking account error turns out it was my mistake and not the bank It had been a while since I had been to this location I didn t wait very long in line and that s an improvement This visit just just seemed different in a great way it was a whole new atmosphere The new manger was very helpful with answering my questions I would recommend this location 226 Main St Kendall Square for your banking needs 
-njRGJVHiYYvKpxXIgufwQ Harvard I don t go to the post office that often but I have been to this one twice now once just using the automated machine and the second time I went to the counter I found everything to be very efficient and the postal workers behind the counter to be nice and helpful The fours stars is for the automated machine experience I had detailed below The service and location conveniently near the T get 5 stars I went one morning thinking the window would be open since the hours were listed as 7 30am til whenever but when I arrived the window was not open the only option was to use the automated mailing machine I wish the hours listing mentioned this detail as I was hoping to interact with a person but oh well such is life Using the automated machine was a little nerve racking as I was mailing an important package I ended up spending a little more money than probably necessary and that I wanted to in order to add delivery confirmation just in case since I felt a little unsure about the whole thing Seems like everything worked out fine and my package arrived at it s destination 
-NLGpWs3FRfQU5--mCF_uA Harvard I dig Cinderella s pizza a lot I find it s consistent fresh tasting and good I always forget this place though Apparently they re open late and I know they deliver I just don t have a menu I ve had to look it up online in obscure texts on MIT student webspace before what s that about UPDATE They mailed me a menu you can totally get them to deliver Toscanini s Ice Cream 
-NmbLCAqRiGkzmjhw3_TwQ Harvard Gorgeous Upstairs on the square is an experience for the eyes and nose taste is controlled by your ability to smell After my third visit to Upstairs I still find this place exciting and now even more rewarding since meeting Matthew the Director of Ops He has an incredible ability to remember a face and insures fantastic service While the food tends toward the expensive side Upstairs offers local grown vegetables and meats and local seafoods in ways you wouldn t think to enjoy in your own home It is a lovely locale to treat a friend your mother anyone special though I maintain that some men can t take the decor too many times in a year 
-nnS8RW5JQ5upcjmDgK9iA Harvard Unfortunately it s yet another generically named Indian place it d be nice to see some different names from time to time Like most Indian places the price range and general quality of meals is probably quite different for lunch and dinner I went here for dinner so no buffet I was pleased to find a Royal Dinner for Two which made the whole night very easy and not any more pricy than it would ve ended up being anyway They had the appetizers and we picked two entrees and two desserts The selection was much wider and more varied than average My taste for Indian is not quite as well tuned as I would like but I d say the dishes themselves ranged from about average the samosa the paneer to above average lamb dish we had the drinks the desserts for a slight fancy Indian place I ve had better elsewhere but the overall experience here was better and easier to manage The waitstaff was responsive and willing to answer my various questions about the food presented to me and quite willing to package it all up for us when we inevitably failed to finish all the food we got I ll definitely go back again 
-nntiIu8QkP9L_VxmHmMlQ Harvard Greater Boston being alongside with San Francisco the most European of metropolitan areas in the United States should have more eatery places like Moody s Falafel Palace This Central Sq obligated late night stop for God s hungry children offers healthy and tasty food from the Middle East at a very affordable price While in Europe it was easy to find these independent food stands which run at a small scale and don t hurt your wallet So far I ve been two times and I m already a fan Try the baba ganouj however it s spelled sandwich This is not a place for an elaborate date but I m sure a lady would appreciate if you showed her this convenient place for the first time 
-npSN90aZyVlh_0c52N3FQ Harvard Beautiful place terrible service We came for a birthday celebration party of 6 very excited to come in there for the first time What a huge disappointment The waiters screwed up on every meal course we had The appetizers the main course not a single dish was delivered to the correct person at the table When they brought the desert there was one with the Happy Birthday signed in chocolate on the plate Nice if it was actually put in front of the person who had the birthday The food was OK and only OK There was nothing interesting out of 6 different dishes And that would be fine but the service was so bad that maybe the food tasted it too The charge for service was automatic on the bill 100 Too bad the team of waiters did not deserve it 
-NQPG9uA7-63eQVwZe0_zQ Harvard I m a big fan of the Central Square Prana studio and apparently of hot yoga I ve never found the non heated varieties of yoga to be my thing as I have trouble sitting still let alone in one pose for minutes on end and must have been doing something wrong as I never found it particularly stimulating or challenging However I decided to give hot power yoga a try as I read that it s very challenging was looking to get a great workout regain some of my loss flexibility and I also am a fan of saunas Prana s classes fit the bill perfectly I ve never sweat so much in my life yet I never felt like I was going to pass out It s challenging without seeming impossible and while I definitely go for the fitness benefits it does leave me feeling very calm clean if possible while drenched in sweat and less stressed I ve gone to a number of classes as they have a variety of times during the week and weekend Central Square is not super convenient to where I live or work but I do try to make it out at least once a week Classes can get a little crowded but the instructors still manage to provide adjustments when you need them 
-NrMvA2Cv9JWjp9p2R_UwQ Harvard Izzy s is one of those neighborhood institutions I wish we have at home in the DC suburbs We were treated like a neighbor the service was very friendly Food was very good of the home cooked variety I had the ox tail stew with a cup of the beef tripe soup Everything was great Lots of the neighborhood residents stopped by while we were eating to get carryout and chatted with the boss and his wife and son Would love to return again next time I m back in Boston

-nSRcmtAkI-0D4_RxV2URg Harvard This is one of those places that I shouldn t review because I love it so much and I don t want people taking up all of the outdoor seating but here I go I love Cafe Pamplona because it offers me the opportunity to feel as if I am in Europe for the afternoon on a sunny day It manages to house itself in a small nook of Harvard where the street is less busy and the buildings surrounding it evoke a different time and or place I also love Cafe Pamplona because of the menu options This is also one of those places where I always give the specials a look over before ordering because today may be the day they are offering one of my favorites The waitstaff may at times seem to be a bit slow this is not the type of place to go to when you re in a hurry but in turn when you want to take your time at lunch the waitstaff does not breathe down your back to get moving even though you ve obviously finished your meal However the person waiting for a table may

-NWx7WGN3jsLdRcgtUkpTg Harvard Easily the best coffee in Kendall They serve both Barrington and Barismo beans The Beyond the Sea Latte is perfection real caramel mixed into a latte topped with flakes of sea salt It sounds very sweet but it s not The thing is otherworldly but don t get it iced Just doesn t translate I had the breakfast sandwich for the first time today and it was good Avocado and grilled onions are always welcome but could use a little more cheese on my egg cheese They seem to have fewer chairs than tables Maybe they keep breaking or perhaps a ploy to keep people from lingering too long Either way jockeying for a spot to sit is the biggest drawback

-O0mZsAZn0dJmv6eVqzJeg Harvard I d been wanting to go to this place for a while after seeing it s successful ratings and popularity on multiple sites including this one and hearing about it constantly from one of my friends So one night after heading home from a Bruins game my buddy and I not wanting to part ways quite yet we decided to head over there for a drink and some grub Unfortunatly for us by the time we got there they stopped serving food that sucked but it did our wallet a favor considering that their food is way overpriced I looked at the menu and was shocked at home expensive it was I go out a lot and it s the first time I ve seen a pulled pork sandwich hit 11 Honestly But there is one thing that in my opinion enabled them to escape with minimum review damage and a whooping four stars and that is their drinks menu They have some classic cocktails that you can t really find anywhere and that s I m very fond of Pimms Singapore Slinger Caiparinha Even the mojito FINALLY A PLACE THAT POURS THESE WHOOOHOO And for that alone I m a fan Needless to say that I had alcoholic drinks as my main food group and dinner that night Well worth it The decor itself is pretty cool and trendy and finding parking in the evening or night isn t usually too hard The bartenders are knowledgeable and actually talented compared to most I ve seen in Beantown they know what they are doing And it reflects Definitely a chill place I will be back 
-o5qyVrkENwE7DrX1YErSQ Harvard A really lovely art museum Not surprisingly Harvard has a pretty nice art collection ranging from some really old wooden panels salvaged from medieval churches to modern art I enjoyed the little display they had on how people made paints back in the 1400s with little vials of mineral dust to show the different colors That was the scientist in me There is an impressive collection of French impressionists many works by artists whose names you ll recognize Some lovely sculpture by Rodin as well Currently there s a room dedicated to Rubens including a really disturbing vision of Leda and the Swan The exhibit on the ground floor called Dissent features the use of printmaking as rebellion throughout history right up to posters and t shirts criticizing the Bush administration You should definitely check it out 9 general admission gets you into the Fogg the Sackler across the street ancient art Asian art Islamic art and the small Busch Reisinger museum attached to the Fogg German and Eastern European artists including an awesome Klimt

-O6KOkyjH8-MbgzItRx0yA Harvard I was in town visiting and I needed a place to watch the United stoke match While I may not have been the happiest with the result from the match phoenix landing certain more than did it s job The draft selection was solid Your normal irish and euro taps along with other major boston new england brews on tap as well There was a good crowd for the match While it wasn t packed to the gills there were plenty of seats taken and it was a crowd that certainly wanted to watch the match It was a pretty good atmosphere and it did make for fun while watching the match I don t know how this is during different circumstances but this is a good place to watch a match

-ODW8QgSC_n9msiNcW9zKA Harvard Came here on a Saturday night with the fiance and some of his work study students for a end of the year party This place was super busy OMG I couldn t even move It was absolutely nuts I wasn t too keen on the whole overcrowded being shoved every two seconds part But the margaritas were awesome They were mixed just right strong but with just the right amount of raspberry sweetness We were seated finally and the waitress was very accommodating She dealt with the unruliness quite well I had the chicken fajitas and the fiance had the burger They were nothing to write home about but definitely hit the spot to soak up that alcohol The group had quesadillas pasta dishes tacos etc All the plates were licked clean so I am assuming their meals were good The highlight of the evening was not consuming 7 margaritas and feeling really good it was seeing Ben Affleck and Jennifer Gardner with their daughter having dinner So cool So Border s gets 4 stars A solid score Minus a star for only 2 stalls in the little girls room What is up with that 
-OFs6uesE25xZaEQt3s6DQ Harvard I went in there expecting something wrong with my car less than 15 minutes all they said was that my tire pressure was off Murph and crew reflated the tires and didn t charge me a dime I ll be back for other services since it appears they understand customer service BTW if you get a free service from them I would recommend at least getting gas from the place as a trade off It s the same price as Hess so you re not going to get ripped off 
-oiB5WVcAEvGhquN7Yx5Jw Harvard I tried this place for the first time last night Even though I had heard great things I am an ice cream and fro yo lover and was worried the yogurt tang wouldn t be sweet enough I was so wrong I tried the original and the peach both amazing but I liked the original best I got rasberries and white chocolate chips and loved every bite I spent the rest of the evening coming up with new combinations of toppings I made sure to ask for a stamp card while I was there since I think it s safe to say I will be coming back here Also glad to know there is no HFCS in it 
-oIKlFQjNh9saAYbLYoeaQ Harvard Went to the sat night 1030 showing of Donkey Show and it was so much fun I had no idea what to expect but there were dancers on platforms and disco blasting when we arrived Fun enough on it s own merits and we were enjoying the vibe drinks and dancing then the show started The performers are so talented I can t really say much without ruining it but they truly are so engaging and so much fun it s amazing they can do it 2x in one night My only regret is that there s no where to sit even for a moment You can spend 2x as much to get a table but it s not worth it floor is where it s at Coat check is an absolute must I should have checked my purse though really was enjoying the dancing all night 
-oimt-rtIDRRYftdZGpmUA Harvard Felipe s Taqueria turns out to be one of the best little taqeria s I ve ever been to Whether you are reveling in their huge burritos drizzled with sides of various salsas or attempting the daunting task of eating their huge portioned platos You can t really go wrong with Felipe s For the money you will probably not find any other place quite like Felipe s Anna s Taqueria rivals Felipe s on some dishes Their portions are monstrous service is fast and the location in the Garage in Harvard Square is perfect The only bone I have to pick with them is the fact that they take cash only no credit or debit Not that you d even have to use a debit or credit card with their prices Personally I love the place and I have a hard time when in Harvard Square deciding where to eat because of its close proximity to another one of my favorites Le s formerly Pho Pasteur Well I highly recommend that you check out Felipe s but don t bring your plastic bring a few George Washingtons 
-ojFOuyxCNM1GKkHYpI4Gg Harvard Went Last Friday and We had Last Smash and Moscow Mule Cocktails Domaine Cheveau Macon Chardonnay Cheese Plate Bone Marrow salad Loup de Mer and the Swordfish Total bill 185 before tip Very reasonable All the food was delicious Though my swordfish seemed bland it was a delicate umami flavor I blame myself for ordering a mild flavored dish after eating rich and awesome bone marrow my first time Her entree and salad were both excellent and the cheese was phenomenal Cocktails were out of sight and the wine was very nice The service was average Our server was attentive but in a pushy way and after every sip of water a staff member topped off our glass of water Also the bar high top chairs felt purposefully uncomfortable with short cushions and no place to rest your feet Overall we were treated very well and enjoyed our evening immensely The wine list was priced a little steep but I am comparing it to other lists that are purposefully reasonably priced The food was very very good The service was totally adequate and the atmosphere was fun The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is that I had really high expectations for the best restaurant in Boston and felt that it fell a little flat I am totally going to give it another try though 
-OjiRL7cQt2sHl2EhAYm8Q Harvard Beers with friends 200 Great Conversation Great Company Perfect Summer Night Priceless Had drinks here last night with a bunch of friends including Barney B I ve been here many times and I love the outdoor seating It s such a huge courtyard so it can fit a lot of people comfortably And there s nothing better than a few drinks with friends on a warm summer night outside My only slight complaint no food after 10pm come on Serve till at least midnight if not 1am 
-OK4RBdBJ1G6YB6WKKFtEw Harvard I d love to give them 5 stars for this location but I just cannot do it The now defunct Davis Square location was just that much better Heaping on praise for the new addition to the menu the Yucatan burrito So good with the pickled onions Try it 
-oMv2Si4Ie45sW8YVDWkyw Harvard I dig this place and while I ve only gone for cocktails they re pretty awesome The drinks are reasonably priced around 6 8 and boy howdy there are a lot of them 6 pages of cocktails plus a couple on the specials menu There are a handful of egg based drinks on the menu and the ones I ve experienced have turned out delicious This place is almost always busy so the bartenders are pretty busy Good luck getting a seat If you manage to get a seat while you wait for drinks it s a good idea to get some snacks to enjoy the chips dip is excellent 
-onvKQcuWvX1Ia6kY3JpfA Harvard Complicated menu read overpriced if you want all the toppings and just like most of the reviewers mentioned massive structural issues with the rollup of this burrito Mine not only collapsed under its own sogginess but it was rolled sideways so it was all guac and salsa on one end and all chicken on the other The taste is not bad and the yogurt replacement of sour cream is a good new age California addition however Anna s at MIT still worth the 5 minute extra walk Oh and they don t take AMEX either 
-OPUZUUwqMwcqQgcI1hQkg Harvard Tragically overrated I won t argue with anyone about the sweet potato fries they ARE really good perfect texture in my opinion And I won t claim that I didn t enjoy my Viagra Burger wait what It was well cooked on a nice ever so slightly crunchy bun and a decent size 7 oz Except that it cost 10 and the bleu cheese on it turned out to be cheap bleu cheese dressing Do you realize that for 2 more you could get a burger at ABE LOUIE S one of the most expensive steakhouses in Boston And they ll at least put real bleu cheese crumbles on it Hell they ll put real bleu cheese crumbles on it at FRIENDLY S The space is too small too or rather they ve crammed way too many tables into it Sure service is friendly so friendly in fact that I couldn t carry on a conversation with my friend for more than 2 or 3 minutes without being bothered by MULTIPLE waitresses at once And about this claim that they ve been named America s Best Burger I don t buy that for a second Yeah it s good but the best Come on now 
-oRPxciUwq8YeS-IcxDERA Harvard Went here last night for some post work drinks after trying to go to Grendel s too crowded and before we headed over to The Burren Cozy bar decent beer selection no hard liquor drinks though be warned nice music casual divey atmosphere I liked that they listed Black Tan Snakebite and Black Velvet on the actual menu I tend to forget these exist unless reminded and their hand cut fries were fresh thick and chunky with the skins still on just how I like em Service was decent prices are decent all in all not a bad place to grab some drinks Not a total destination but not a total last resort either IMO

-ot3a-SxinexzVptFmIl3w Harvard First off thank you Henrietta s Table for having a vegan option for restaurant week I love restaurant week but as a vegan it s so limiting as to which places I can go So I was super excited to see an option this year yay We went on Tuesday night my first time ever to this place Thankfully I had made reservations for 2 at 7 30pm otherwise who knows when we would have been seated there was a line and all the tables were being used We were seated immediately upon arrival Bread basket yum Love the variety of 3 breads that cranberry nut bread is delicious They serve it with a side of butter as usual Sometimes at nicer restaurants when I tell them I m vegan when I order they bring me out olive oil to use for the bread but our waitress didn t pick up on that No big deal just not giving them an above and beyond star Salads I got the spinach salad with nuts and mandarin oranges minus the cheese with the maple dressing Yummy My boyfriend got a salad with roasted tomatoes and prosciutto He enjoyed his a lot I got 2 glasses of wine throughout the night since it was restaurant week all glasses are 1 off awesome I choose to go local and drank the Rhode Island wine which was decent and cheap Boyfriend got a coke Entrees Boyfriend got the pork with a side of mash potatoes he liked it a lot I got the vegan option which is the same as the vegetarian option for restaurant week which was roasted veggies and quinoa with a side of brussel sprouts The brussel sprouts were great and come with olive oil not butter The roasted veggies with quinoa was OK I mean flavor wise it was great and again I am appreciative that I could even eat there But for a place like this I expected a better presentation It looked kind of sad All the little chopped up veggies looked like someone had just opened up a microwave bag of veggies and put them on my plate The presentation or idea could have been better for sure Desserts Boyfriend got the maple cheesecake and liked it a lot I got the sorbet and picked the chocolate yum and citrus sorbet It was good and a nice presentation Even though it was restaurant week we still spent over 100 but I am glad we finally got to experience dinner here I loved the open kitchen and the lighting and how all the tables are in the same room and it s very open But the acoustics were bad it s really loud there and hard to hear Gift shop is cute 
-owx1Yd4yYtzYNAEcsZFRA Harvard The lackluster yelp reviews almost made us stop going in but on a Sunday night at 7 30 pm in Kendall Square nothing else was open We re glad we tried it We can t quite understand the negative reviews The ingredient combinations we tried of the two pizzas we got carry out were really good Both were blackboard specials The first one was chorizo with dill pickles a surprisingly good combination while the second was a smoked salmon with creme fraiche and caper pizza My favorite was the smoked salmon so yummy The pizzas were a wee bit oiler than I would like perhaps because of our ingredient choices so deducting one star for that but if we were staying in Cambridge longer would make this one of our take out places 
-OXfriQH8je_Vah19hNMOQ Harvard My boyfriend and I finally went to The Blue Room on Friday night after hearing rave reviews from several friends Not so impressed We went at 8 30 on a Friday night and although it was surprisingly slow our service was incredibly sub par It s one of those places where you can really tell you re getting crappy service just because you didn t order a bottle of wine and one of you is a super picky eater who orders appetizers as her meal Yep that s me We did get the hummus to start with though and I barely touched it It had a weird sweetness to it that I just don t want in my hummus When we finally got our meals after everyone around us who had gotten there after us received theirs we were pleased to find out that they were really tasty despite the fact that I had to pick the goat cheese out of my dish that I specifically asked them to exclude Our waiter dropped our check onto the table without even asking us if we wanted dessert Too bad for him because I m a huge dessert eater but that was the last straw and we just wanted to leave Normally I wouldn t be so hard on a restaurant for a bad night of service but at The Blue Room it was pretty obvious that we were in the very back of our waiter s mind throughout our entire meal Not the kind of atmosphere I like Probably won t be going back 
-oYBjWVeAB6zzpGEEgu1nA Harvard This is a great place to eat The flatbread pizza is phenomenal and the wine selection is great I tell all my friends about this place 
-OzYi3VsnEz9xisag5qbUA Harvard I went for a celebration dinner One of Amy s friends was just asked to join the faculty of a major college They figured that John Harvard s would be a good choice The insides feature dark wood and sturdy chairs I loved that The menu features mostly burgers sandwiches some main dishes American food a few pizzas a few salads and bar food type appetizers Both of the ladies got salads with teriyaki chicken One made a serious dent into hers and the other finished hers off completely I love a woman who tucks into her food I asked for an Angus beef roquefort sp burger It comes with a pickle spear and steak fries I m not much of a fries kind of guy anymore but I do love steak fries especially when they are crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside These were not those fries Some were perfectly cooked others were limp and had probably been sitting around for a while I wasn t going to eat them all anyway so me picking out the ones I like worked out ok However if I were truly hungry and wanted to eat more fries I would have been super disappointed The fries were dusted with some sort of seasoning salt Probably Lawry s Chop up some garlic parsley and some parmesan and dust them in that and you would have some awesome steak fries I didn t eat the bun on my burger It was a soft bread The menu said kaiser roll but it reminded me more of potato bread The burger patty wasn t too well seasoned I asked for well done It was well done I couldn t taste the cheese at all The carmelized onions didn t do much to add to the flavor The bacon on my burger however was delicious I wish I had asked for a BLT with that bacon It would have been delicious Our waitress was pretty good about keeping glasses refilled This would be a good place for a birthday dinner I noticed a smaller dining room to the side I wanted to sit in there ha ha The pizzas and wings I saw on other tables looked delicious I think I just ordered the wrong things Prices weren t unreasonable either 
-p-R95fsWw2Qt4HNniWM9A Harvard Ah what a nice place It reminds me of a restaurant you d wander into in some little college town not a barren MIT wasteland At Emma s you can get really tasty pizza and great wine End of story A wonderful place On a Friday night my boyfriend and I shared a jug of sangria while waiting and hour for our table best restaurant wait in a long long time 
-p-vDyAXIA1t2EZPGyg6dA Harvard I really liked this bar My friend came here 15 years ago when looking at colleges and since we found ourselves back in Cambridge we decided to check it out We grabbed a seat at the bar downstairs I liked that they had Franziskaner Weissbier on draft I also got the pasta with gorgonzola sauce which was delicious I also had the bread whcih was fresh and tasty The service was great and I had an excellent time I have no beef with Grendel s so it gets a 5 I d definitely go back 
-P2o0VRPs_F_rYLhkkV_OA Harvard Not the place for a serious book collector but if you are a reader of general books it is comparable to Borders 99 of their used books are paperbacks Used US history fills about 2 racks of 10 total shelves world history about 1 rack of 5 shelves The books are mixed military next to politics next to social history The new history books are similarly scarce almost all paperback and mixed together The books are in very good condition it just that the selection is poor Compared to a chain like Half Price Books in Seattle this is of significantly lower quality and quantity Very disappointing 
-P2trOjuq3Jk6qe4eQz_aQ Harvard One of the gems of Harvard Square Isn t one of those comic book shops that s about the toys and trading card games and tabletop RPGs It s all comics and graphic novels and books and magazines about the above Well there are a few random books that seem out of place but 99 of the tiny packed space is about comics The prices can be a little steep but it s worth it to keep shops like this around At least that s how I explain their scary effectiveness when it comes to parting me from my money 
-P7XN0jiP24YeEYGv-xXgQ Harvard I loved this restaurant La Groceria is an unassuming unpretentious looking place but the food is amazing Everything I had here was phenomenal Actually reminiscing about it now makes me hungry all over again Only the dinner menu is served on Saturday unless you ask While lingering outside the restaurant trying to decide whether to go in or not and whether it was one diner friendly I read the description on the posted menu for their Grilled Shrimp dish which was only on their lunch menu It was the reason I stepped into the restaurant My waitress was so accommodating and helpful She went without complaint or hint that I was being a nuisance into the kitchen and requested the dish for me She came back saying it was no problem at all The five very large shrimp had a hint of smoky charred flavor but the shrimp itself was unblackened and tender The flavor of the shrimp was so intense These were served over a saffron risotto with peas and leeks and other deliciousness and an amaretto white zinfandel sauce I loved it 20 The almond pastry dessert I had was unbelievable Starting from the bottom there were two layers of almond infused cake separated by a thin layer of sweet almond y goodness On top of that was a thick layer of cream topped with crunchy and sweet almond bits And all of that was drizzled with caramel The size of this dessert was big enough for 4 people I wanted to eat every bite but couldn t even get through half of it The other half made for tasty dessert leftovers later that night 8 To drink the Italian mojito a mojito with a twist The twist being the essence of basil a brilliant and not too subtle enhancement of the standard mojito 9 The complimentary bread that is served after you place your order is worth a mention here I took one bite into the warm and doughy slice and raved uncontrollably about it to a passing waiter who informed me that it is baked fresh in their kitchen This bread was so soft and subtly garlicky topped with fresh tomato chunks and onions that were baked onto the bread Wow I asked for extra bread and then asked my waitress to put more in my takeout container The sparse decor is the charm of La Groceria With the afternoon sunshine streaming in through the front windows the wooden tables and chairs glow with earthy modesty and you enjoy your unbelievable meal while bathing in this simple peaceful natural light coupled with non pretentious un affected service this was better than any upscale dining experience especially on a quiet Saturday afternoon 
-pAimWGuoTaxDb3_5RO0EA Harvard It was much much better than I expected and exceeded many of the reviews I read on Yelp before going The atmosphere was typical faux Irish pub our waitress was attentive and we were endlessly entertained by the electronic trivia game board on our table I had the Reuben with a side of saut ed garlic tomato and broccoli The vegetables were tasty and cooked properly The Reuben was actually really good for a restaurant I am very biased toward the Reubens my parents make It had good sauerkraut In an ideal world this one would have a little less corned beef and a little more sauerkraut and it would have been on marble bread like the menu said instead of just straight up rye but I can t complain Boyfriend had the blueberry beer yum and the turkey burger I had a few bites and it was good but not as good as mine He said the fries were nothing special Reasonable prices and I d definitely go here again I d love to try the shepherd s pie next time 
-pBl4mN8n6hiUAxre8TjWA Harvard The idea is good but the execution was poor The food was overly salty and portions were small even for tapas standards We ordered the veggie spring rolls but they were poorly made however the dipping sauce was the only tasty element in the dish The wrap was not even tight so the fillings fell out as soon as you touched it with your chopsticks The beef noodles were flavorful but again it was overly salty and would not be a good pick for someone who is diabetic The noodles were overcooked and was soggy unlike how fresh noodles should taste if they re hand ripped The beef tongue was the only saving grace of the four dishes we ordered The last and final dish was the pork belly skewer tasteless and the sause did not compliment the meat but that s probably because the meat tasted like it was precooked and then reheated prior to serving dry and tasteless The service was sub par as well We didn t get our plates until after we started on our first dish Moreover when we were nearing the end of our meal the bus boy didn t even allow us to finish the food on our dishes and quickly cleared them away My gf and I glanced at each other and was appalled at how unaware the servers were For those who gave a rating of 3 starts or more need to get their taste buds checked Overall definitely overpriced for something you could easily make at home 
-PbsgnlaffkCKlKmMOPlLA Harvard I had the eggplant masala dosa with garlic naan delicious They have some inconspicuous seating in the back for a nice yet casual meal Still a little higher prices than I expect for take out indian food but well worth the price The only reason I didn t give it five stars was we got an online coupon for 25 dollars and the man serving us failed to tell us we could only use it once and cheated us out of five dollars we would have been happy to use on the meal knowing we wouldn t get to use it again Still great food and I will go back again I must add that the owner of this place is so rude he s almost started an altercation with my boyfriend over an online order that turned out he DID receive He s just always curt and unwelcoming not the way to treat customers I will still give them four stars because their food is scruptious 
-PC82Jh-d5YW9ERiDJNMKw Harvard Good food Had the salmon and calamari Took my wife there for Valentine s day had a three course meal with a glass of wine was awsome 
-pcXc2PHoRYRyD6sFGwnrA Harvard For years I have been told by several older people that Dolphin Seafood is excellent I finally got to go there and just kinda shrugged my shoulders after my experience The service was polite but nothing special I got a garden salad to start which was a generic salad one would expect at a random diner I got the Idaho trout picatta which was very bland compared to other picattas I ve had The trout was also very fishy tasting Sadly the best part of the meal was the crinkle fries which made me reminisce of my elementary school cafeteria days 
-pD78viuODFtDU-NayWNEw Harvard I will be forever indebted to this place for the simple fact that I got a 100 cashmere jacket here for 30 dollars Its like the salvation army but hip 
-Pf4V8yabNDQJn_oIAG5Ng Harvard Passed by this place It s a very cute and little crepe joint They have anything from sweet to savory crepes I had a standard crepe and it was delish I like my crepes crispy and not soft and this place did a good job Sooo basically I love this place 
-pF8xlMZdgML-T7zZIXJdA Harvard I was in town visiting some friends and we went out to Border Cafe for some margaritas and food It was pretty delicious nothing amazing but good food at a good price I m not from Boston so I think I would check out other places when I come back but that s not to say that this place shouldn t be on your list if you are looking for decent food cheap and a fun atmosphere The waitress was extremely nice prompt and courteous I had the 1 2 steak 1 2 chicken fajita which was flavored really well and cooked just right The chips and salsa were great although I would have preferred a slightly spicier salsa Drinks were okay but not too strong which was a tiny letdown but nothing drastic maybe I m just an alchy at this point and can t taste booze 
-phMx23hz4OYmyL6EPpxkw Harvard UGH I really wanted to like this place but it fell short way short So we were dying to eat here as we had heard great things about this place The only AMAZING thing about it was my cocktail which was called the Battle of Trafalgar and it was awesome The waitress told me that they are known for this drink and have won awards for it and yes it was awesome The food was not so awesome We decided to order a few of the small plates so that we could try a variety of dishes We ordered the Jonah Crab Cakes very small portion tons of mayo which overpowered the actual crab meat so all in all very disappointing Short Rib Wellington this was definitely not a short rib wellington it was more like short rib stew with a topping of pastry puff The pastry puff was dry and the short rib stew was very watery again disappointed House Charcuterie Board ugh bread that came with it was dry no mustard provided the duck ham was sliced ridiculously thin and there were about three tiny slices of it the chicken liver pate was good but I have had better basically this does not even compare to Ten Tables charcuterie plate which is plentiful with tons of extras we then ordered the Smoked Lamb Belly Toast not kidding there was no lamb belly on the toast and this was just doused in butter and really terrible I would have returned it but by that point the disappointment and disgust was overwhelming the final thing we ordered was the Crispy Soft Poached Chip In Farm Egg this was AWESOME very different filled with flavor and my husband wanted another one definitely worth ordering All in all I would come back here for a drink but not the food It is very overpriced for the quality of food that you get So disappointing 
-Pj3uJJZrpC5jLLV6K0wPQ Harvard First of all I had no idea what sort of Asian food this was We called in our order and went down to pick it up so that may have contributed to the fact that is was all cold The Mixed Teppanyaki included the tiniest piece of steak grizzle and fat and a disgusting little cube of salmon The Gado Gado had more okra than I ve ever seen who likes okra Crab Mango Salad was slimy cold with soggy fried crabs The Tamari Garden Salad soggy What a disaster 
-PjdKHJXIqc1_WizWt2lKQ Harvard I was lucky enough to attend a Bachelorette Party here for my best friend and the girls I d never been here and was surprised at how easily accessible it was by T or by bus I arrived early it was a surprise and was quickly greeted by members of the staff who assured me that I was early and should feel free to putter around the store until our tasting Once our party arrived and we got started everything went well and was just delicious The gentleman who guided us through the tasting forgive me for not remembering your name was incredibly knowledgeable patient thank you for snapping photos for us and charming He really made the experience all the more special The pairings were spot on including cured meats made in house and an incredible cheese and bread pairing and the selection heavy on the French varietals for our Francophile bride were perfectly selected I ve been dying to return here and hopefully will soon I walked away that night with two wines from our tasting they were just fantastic 
-pjj8dKtuvhhTfD4FDlbYw Harvard We went there for restaurant week and pick from the fix menu Cheese fondue ok it did upset my stomach later on Grilled Filet Mignon I do not think that was a fillet mignon I am not sure what cut was but it was not good at all And if it was filet mignon it was the worse I ever had Chocolate fondue not impressed They could have picked better dark chocolate And the selection of fruits we had did not go well with chocolate My friend tried the lamb chops not good either It seemed little effort was put on the plates presentations And 2 same dishes looked completely different The service was good I would not go back to this place 
-pkZ5cYbHyE8Xmp5bYlXQw Harvard With the fancy burger names and the price you d expect something grand What you get is a smallish burger that while it tastes decent leaves you wanting more The fries were pretty good though No wait when we went there but it was pretty late All in all it was alright If I was in the area again I might try it again but I won t go out of my way for it If you need a bathroom to wash your hands before you eat they don t have a bathroom Walk a couple blocks over and you ll find one though 
-pLBL_uht5AXPwfnDIvuCw Harvard I don t think I ve ever walked into this store and not purchased something I sometimes wander in just because I want to see something pretty especially these days with all the rain The stacks of seed bead vials are better than candy I also really appreciate how organized everything is You can look around and find everything without asking for help but when you need help it s available And there really is something for everyone beautiful semi precious stones and vintage finds as well as horn and stone And you can find those plastic earring back stops so you don t look your earrings They don t even have those at CVS 
1SlexGDknZA4_rpt7wDCyQ Princeton I don t think this place needs reviews since it was beyond capacity on Saturday nights If you ve ever tried the efes in new Brunswick this is very similar and that s a good thing for those who haven t had the other place Very surprised by the first review Granted service wasn t excellent but that s not their forte their food however should have compensated I would suggest he take another attempt their food is very nice and one of the very few turkish places in a 20 mile radius I also suggest people try Istanbul Cafe in North Brunswick We always order an appetizer platter at every mediterranean spot and a chicken kebab platter Here we enjoyed all the appetizers and a solid 4 Marinated and juicy chicken very well done about 15 minutes waiting The combo platter is good if you like meat since thats the focus but note the gyro meat is delicious Definitely stop by for either sandwiches pick up and go though For those eating platters have it nice and warm 
1sopjD7FbDXxgtVEq7EyRw Princeton I don t really understand the hype I have no problem with Small World except the crowds if you like a crowded atmosphere you might really love it here It s just not my scene They make a splendid spicy chai that will clear out your sinuses it s great 
1TBivcJUcJCiYGJY-fWJ4g Princeton I love this place so much I used to come here all the time in high school and whenever I m home for the holidays I make the time to visit Prex I can spend hours here browsing through the used rock CDs they have on the back right wall looking for old favorites The fact that these CDs are completely disorganized is part of the appeal of this place for me since I feel like it adds to the triumph when I find something good This place always gives me a sense of nostalgia when I enter sigh I love the Princeton Record Exchange 
1TChI1tU3QSITdd69VT29Q Princeton Taste of Mexico offers good unpretentious Mexican food prepared from scratch in front of you at decent prices The ambiance sucks the restaurant is in a strip mall with four tables and bar seating with a few outside tables when weather permits but the food is solid enough that we keep going back Due to limited space some things like the chips and salsa are clearly off the shelf although the entrees are all freshly prepared In particular the tacos al pastor are really good as are the enchiladas Don t be afraid to ask if you want your food spicier as the default is somewhat mild 
1ti3VnuQcC83kBfm97dPXQ Princeton Salon Facci is a great place Melissa is the best and is very patient at discussing various options She s been there forever and is wonderful 
1TKSgi4NSS5gQcMl538wpg Princeton This is the one on Route 1 outside the Quakerbridge Mall I noticed there are 2 yelp postings for this location FYI Overall its just ok Quality of service has definitely deteriorated over the next couple of years I feel sorry for them when Cheesecake Factory moves in next door in the mall Very very disappointing happy hour Needs cheap early apps too on Saturday and Sunday 
1tr1-Msr0F7JdrvTaknoIw Princeton So I met a few friends and had lunch here It s not a place I would typically eat 1 cause I m a vegetarian with the exception of fish every once in a while and 2 cause I m not a huge fan of BBQ taskting food aka steak house food but that is where they wanted to go so we did I had the fish special which was very good pricy yes but good I know this might sound weird but I love the decor of the bathrooms I know people don t go to a place based on what the bathroom looks like but I needed to say it The bathrooms are gorgous Dark wood and earthy tile LOVE IT Anyway so my friends love the food there and eveyone seems to like it so based on that and on what I had to eat I give it a 3 and 4 for ambiance and decor But keep in mind if you aren t a big meat eater like myself you don t really have much options except for like one or two things 
1tvxbB2153gQQR6fvfPukA Princeton Great thin crust pizza We went with sausage and red peppers and another with pepperoni Generous with the toppings and great flavors Sausage was a little spicy and had a kick You order first then get some drinks at the bar you sit when your pizza is ready Old school building but delicious pizza will deff be back 
1U-7QWepf5etf-R0othe1g Princeton Phenomenal meal here last week with a business associate The place was bustling the food was phenomenal the service was superb I loved this place and I can t wait to get back to that neighborhood to eat here again the food was VERY VERY VERY good 
1uLXT7qNBwnqUs6OFy3g7g Princeton I bought a bike from them after intense shopping While in the past I have been in there and experienced indifferent service actually used another bike store for a few years Jennifer is AMAZING Other stores are now charging to fit you to the bike and it can become pricey No problem here she took her time price was extremely competitive The other great thing is even after I did a number on the bike last week no charge to put it back in service 
1uNaOE7h9dhcSz27GaOZuA Princeton The hands down BEST vegetarian food I have ever eaten I got the curry supreme the first and only time I ve eaten there so far but had a taste of my dad s sweet and sour sensation and both dishes were to die for Most of the main dishes come with either taro spring rolls vegetable spring rolls with a softer shell than usual and brown and red rice both of which I had never tried before but they were a nice complement to my meal Hopefully next time I m in Princeton I can eat there again Thank you Zen Palate for expanding MY palate 
1us9h6C3o0SjFlSS3r5UEA Princeton Amoeba records is a classic Buuuuuuuuuuuut classic this Princeton Record Exchange can out dance Amoeba anyday PRE can bust out moves and tunes for such crazy prices that Amoeba would have to dust off that shoulder and just walk away Amoeba would get serioulsy SERVED if it had to compete with Princeton Record Exchange I grew up with PRE so like Bonnie am probably a little biased but I can say with whole heart that PRE is an original It takes a beautiful group of people with different loves of all kinds of music to create a strong second hand record store PRE has such a superb following with such diverse tastes for such a long period of time now that the gems in this place are everywhere It glimmers All sorts of people wander in trying to sell back CD s records videos and DVDs There are no pretensions They have respect for everybody s music choices Next Mariah Carey sweet Yanni uh nice Tom Jones classic Kenny G uh is this yours ok maybe a liiiiittle pretentious But we can sum it up to taste and let s be honest here Kenny G was my dad s PRE is like rummaging through your grandparents basement it s slightly dingy and the dust may stick to your fingers but you have no qualms about plopping yourself down inches between the black leather soles of a punk rocker and the leather wedges of a well groomed sorority ish girl to burrow away in the big bargain CD and video crates It is here where I first began my video and foreign film DVD collections Scooping up piles of classics like The Mirror has Two Faces Zoolander Animal House Detroit Rock City Sex Y Lucia and more Prices are so cheap that it s a great opportunity to branch out and try new genres of movies and music Of course sometimes PRE s magic is so alluring and many a friend that has accompanied me here can testify to it s hypnotizing powers that you end up buying lame crap Old 90 s pop Whitney Houston singles and and early 80 s and 90 s soundracks That at the end of the day you re ready to trade it right back If you re ever anywhere near this store you owe it to music to try it out The music gods will smile kindly upon you PRE is blessed and will guide you towards rows of music nostalgia There ll be some sweet music at the end of it I d even bet my used Jerky Boys 2 CD on it 
1vbTKrWbl6jfbiVsuohNyQ Princeton Omg i don t know if it was my selection of food that i chose but this was the worst chinese food I d ever had in my life My stomach aches at the thought of it I almost had to force it down 
1vOGG_riiCu_Te1OLPe4Mg Princeton I go to Small World everyday for an expresso based drink so I can t comment on the drip coffee Lattes and cappuccinos are fantastic and usually have plenty of rich coffee flavor The drinks are fairly consistent even with different baristas The staff are friendly and make drinks quickly and there is free wifi Almost always busy short wait though so I m not the only one who loves this place 
1vSWnsNFxnsssvCfKmaT_w Princeton The staff couldn t be any nicer and they have the most impressive selection of chips of any deli I ve ever visited but the thing that makes them really great They carry Lightlife Smart Deli vegan slices in ham and turkey Get a combo throw in a bag of Wise Onion Rings 
1VW3mxBpXqc6x4zrFK0woQ Princeton The bar offers a club like atmosphere and the big horseshoe bar sits in front of a large Normal Rockwell attributed it s unsigned painting of Yankee Doodle that s fun to enjoy while having a pint on a Saturday Afternoon Princeton is not a town of super great bars and this the A B and Triumph make the borough s first tier Reasonably priced never noisy or overly crowded it s a great place to go with a few friends The food here is pretty good a big step above pub stuff The composed salads are particularly nice 
1W4ciYghmIlgwUNA0ssP_g Princeton I had Sunday brunch here with my family The atmosphere is charming especially around the holidays if you like that ye old pub kind of stuff which I do It s tastefully decorated and cozy and the staff is very nice The food here is OK and my impression is that they are going for the gastro pub trend but it s more American B B hotel fare than English foodie style food The bread basket had too many overly sweet things and not enough savories and my Paris Brest Salmon with eggs was just ok What I would definitely recommend The eggnog New to the menu it is rich frothy and strong They make it with peanut butter which I found very interesting you can t taste it but the richness is there I think this place has a lot of potential but they need to decide which direction to go on the food Either keep it pricey as it is now and turn it up a few notches or make it cheap and cheerful I m not sure that I d go back for a full meal but I would definitely stop by in the evening for a pint and an appetizer 
1WHA0CqT8KX_AB9eCLWuJg Princeton Hoagie Haven is a Princeton institution Cheap delicious fast and greasy food Whether it s noon and you re sober or midnight and you re drunk Hoagie Haven is delicious I highly recommend the cheese fries or buffalo cheese fries buffalo fries or honey mustard cheese fries or any of the fat sandwiches George s next door usually does better hot sandwiches though better quality chicken at least so if you are going during the day it might be worth checking George s out instead Otherwise they have the same owners and make basically the same food 
1WJb78rjsqYFDzNWWqQc0g Princeton This is one of my favorite places in the Princeton area The outdoor Cabana is my favorite place to hangout being the only outdoor bar in the area for one but on top of that great frozen drinks and the food always consistent and delicious Try the mussels or the seared tuna i mean really I have enjoyed everything I have ordered The ambiance is very chill and relax so great for hanging out with friends I would definitely recommend Main Street Bistro to anyone looking for good food and ambiance The staff is extremely friendly and accomodating as well Never had a bad experience here 
1WJzCJ4BEi6zsd5GSiyVfw Princeton My girlfriend had the m nage trois vegetable entree The fried tofu and stuffed pepper were good I had the grilled shrimp salad Good flavor but for a entree salad it was a bit small Plenty of shrimp and other items could have used some more lettuce We sat outside in the patio ish area but the plastic sides were closed because of wet weather A bit humid and warm but understandable since it was not a real room Barely waited two minutes for a table on a late August Friday night at about 7pm Nice wait staff albeit a bit spread thin Nice touch having Hershey s Kisses instead of mints on the way out Would have been 3 5 stars if Yelp let me but I ll round up for this one 
1x7RoP8Xy5vR0EOwetsuiw Princeton I recently joined a number of my work colleagues for lunch at nearby Ganges Generally I have a pretty poor opinion of Indian restaurants in the area The food usually is pretty underwhelming bland and appears to be put together by non chefs cooks who know the ingredients but really can t cook well they can do just enough to get by I will say that my standards for Indian food are extremely high since both my wife I can really cook good Indian food We had about 8 of us going to lunch Kedar Danielle and I left the office on time and waited and waited and waited for the others to turn up Turns out Bill kept everyone waiting I would have just left him behind Anyway onto the food We did the buffet which is the typical Indian lunch thing The assortment wasn t great They had the typical chicken tikka masala which seemed watered down a few vegetable dishes tandoori chicken usually the worst thing to eat in a buffet and Ganges did not disappoint There weren t any lamb dishes what the heck They did have masala dosa if requested which we obviously did But it took them forever to bring out the right chutney I was done with my dosa by the time it came out Dessert was way too sweet as is usual with Indian desserts We ordered the chai which was excessively milky and short on spices The others seemed to like this place somewhat more than I did All I have to say is either they don t know Indian food or their standards leave a lot to be desired I for one will not return www foodielifestyle com 
1Xc1QGvW64v8jFrnYTlPJA Princeton If I was rating this place solely on dessert I d give it a 4 The key lime pie was phenomenal and the peach raspberry cobbler great But alas I m not rating it only on dessert I had the Gaucho Steak which comes with corn cakes and sauteed onions The steak was tasty but the portion was small Most of my plate was taken up by three corn cakes and a ton of onions The corn cakes were literally corn and batter that was fried into a pseudo pancake They were extremely bland The tiny amount of steak I was given for 18 was good The only reason I m giving a 3 instead of a 2 is the sole appetizer I had that was great Their Korean Short Rib BBQ sliders were awesome No complaints there That bumps them back up to 3 status in the hope that perhaps some of their other menu items are better 
1XLCEsRggKdqyYiwKIpCgw Princeton Fact The best bagel sandwiches are born and raised in Princeton New Jersey Super Fact That is 173 miles from where I live currently Optimum Fact This distance does not deter me from gormandizing Bagel Barn whenever and as frequently as possible My girlfriend grew up in Princeton and has been consuming these magnificent entities since birth I however have only been in the picture 3 7 years and am way behind Located in a very nonchalant looking plaza Bagel Barn has a huge deli area bagel area and some picnic table style seating The deli selections are fantastic more salads and meats to choose from than you would ever imagine coming from a bagel place or even a normal sized grocery store Great variety of bagel types just as you would expect Get food bagels everything eat it now Depending on the time of day and how long it has been since my last visit I get a Breakfast Bagel Sandwich Bacon Egg Cheese on a blueberry bagel It is not actually a blueberry bagel unless the bagel itself is blue and these are as blue as they get Real egg Real bacon Real cheese Really melted Really blue Super good Lunch Bagel Sandwich Tuna on an everything bagel with lettuce tomato onions pickles and spicy mustard Get This In Your Mouth Now I don t know what it is about their tuna but it is amazing So depending on the time of day I get one or both of those sandwiches and then take some bagels to go The people that work there are super nice and make you feel right at home even if you don t know exactly what you want super fast right away Watch out they close earlier than you would expect most days 3 or 4pm so don t dilly dally on your way there Do yourself a favor and go get some bagels bagel sandwiches and or some bagels and a few more bagels bagels BAGELS BAGEL BARN Carb up like tomorrow s a marathon 
1XNjbKts-Tzw2DmSHw9sIA Princeton I ve had better It was edible but I wasn t really enjoying my food here 
1xwcTG19N99_IftelsA1gQ Princeton I was forewarned that this was like a supermarket on steroids Currently in love with their diet cherry wedge grapefruit cherry soda Seriously I was just happy to find a grocery store near downtown Princeton Con It s not within walking distance of downtown Princeton Pros It has anything I might need which justifies a car trip including Chili Garlic Sauce organic foods drugstore items and Diet Cherry Wedge I ve boycotted Whole Foods because service is frustrating notwithstanding the horrendous pricing so this is a fine alternative for when I do need to pick up a car full of anything Latest problem I can t find it The GPS drops me off at Home Depot instead so I get more lightbulbs Bad TomTom 
1xYXj7_VhfynS88clpG_mw Princeton I believe this place open not too long ago The service was great thanks Jesse and the flavors yummy I especially like the Baco 
1YadJjF53f7WkeSOEBqIAg Princeton I wish I had a place like this near me in DC I guess it s pretty well suited to a college town but it was really charming I stopped in for breakfast and though they didn t have many food options I settled on a bagel and an Earl Grey latte The latte was delicious delicate but flavorful with just the right amount of spice I had been a little wishy washy when ordering and because I had had a hard time deciding between two options the owner stopped by with a small cup of the one I didn t order to let me taste it She was interested in my feedback about the Chai latte which she makes in a traditional style and not as sweet as what some are accustomed to I thought that was really sweet of her The owner was super friendly and attentive The guy behind the register wasn t quite as nice But it was a nice experience and I d definitely go back if in Princeton again 
1YB-1gzVPQw9ecPg4fa2KQ Princeton After picking up a water heater in Whiting we were hungry Ganges was en route had a few new reviews and Indian food sounded good Very friendly service It was a bit chilly near the A C so our server turned it down I left my sweater in the car Jim ordered a lassi which was tangy and not overly sweet We were off to a good start The Chicken 65 was interesting and good bright red pieces of chewy but tender chicken with mild to medium hot pan fried green chiles and crispy curry leaves Not very spicy but good We are not sure which poori we ordered or received What we got were crispy 2 puffs filled with chickpeas and onion topped with crunchy noodles and a sweet and tangy yogurt tamarind sauce which we scooped up it tasted like apricot and honey over a super tangy yogurt This may have been Dahi Sev Poori with chickpeas instead of potatoes Then our usual lamb saag though with a side of roti instead of naan There is heat in this one it builds up nicely 50 of the dish was lamb and it was not as tender as some places a knife was needed but the flavour was very good We overate picking at it for another 10 minutes after telling one another we were more than full The rice was good neither dry and crumbly nor mushy The spicy mint sauce was excellent nearly as good as Taj Mahal s in Brooklyn Including tax but not tip 33 with a full set of leftovers The service is very attentive but not in your face The server s will come by when you appear cold you don t have to call them over When the plates need changing someone will show up Ditto for water We didn t have to ask for anything Even perusing the menus we took our time and once we decided we were ready the server showed up This is awesome There are also Indian styled Chinese dishes served here which have gotten press recently and intrigue me They re also open past 9PM Yeah Open Tue Thu 11 30am 3pm 5 30pm 10pm Fri 11 30am 3pm 5 30pm 10 30pm Sat 11 30am 3 30pm 5 30pm 10 30pm 
1yEgcNxTRBbAex4_KulQ6g Princeton This is quite a surprise that this place has better review than either the halo or Thomas I have been to this place a couple of times but I was always disappointed I don t mean they are not tasty It s just that the ice cream in bent spoon is not as good as either Thomas or Halo especially considering bent spoon is more expensive That s why for the time I was in Princeton I barely went here whereas I went to either Thomas or Halo regularly Maybe it s about being experimental or conservative and I hate to be experimental in terms of ice cream Now next time I go back to the town of Princes I will have to try this place again either to take back what I said here or to confirm my disappointment 
1yNzvZkV-51fgmAVEwmskw Princeton This place is pretty much a middle of the road neighborhood favorite It s a nice go to if you really have no other choices or ideas on where to eat drink since princeton is lacking in the latter The menu is american favorites and nothing extraordinary but nothing particularly bad the bar is ok small and cramped though when crowded One time me and my friends wanted to get drinks and one of our group wanted to eat so we were seated in the dining area But since three of us weren t eating they kicked us out into the bar area where my friend had to eat her bowl of chili holding it while perched on a bar stool It was pretty ridiculous so it s deterred me from bringing a mix group of people ie people who have eaten and want a drink along with people who just want to drink it s either or They have an excellent sunday brunch however 
1Ys8c815E-opWSuYdXzQyg Princeton I didn t know what to expect when I walked into ONE 53 for dinner I had read very little about the restaurant online and didn t do my normal drool ritual while looking at the menu Overall the dinner was a pleasant surprise The appetizers were fresh and prepared well letting the ingredients themselves shine on the dish The clams were fresh and the sauce they sat in complimented them well but wasn t overly complex The beet salad was fresh and simply prepared The entrees were similar in design simple and straight forward with no fancy sauces to mask the meats I chose the chicken milanese which was lightly breaded not too oily and a controlled enough cook to keep the moistness in the chicken A fresh tomato salsa esque sauce accompanied it The chef s preparation was smart letting the breadcrumbs and capers in the tomato salsa provide the right amount of salt The other diners I was with got the burger which was cooked with just as much care The standout component on the dish was the truffle mayo aioli Silly to love a sauce but this is worth sticking in your purse and bringing it home with you Overall ONE 53 is a great place that pays a lot of attention to its dishes the meats sauces and components on it Every addition on the plate is purposeful and meant to add a taste or texture to the plate which is how plates should be made 
1yxx-2hJLYy6zE45t3CtRw Princeton Great Food I love the udon the combo plates and the sushi rolls They are always very busy and are very fresh Food is a good portion too on the combo plates They deliver pretty fast as well if you can t make it out to them This place is a win in my book Great spot for lunch or a great home delivery place for folks in the area 
1Z19qXRB6VXt3cJk4eM2dw Princeton Absolutely lovely I had been looking for a nice place to get my nails done while I was in Princeton for the summer and I happened upon this quaint place unexpectedly I walked in with no appointment and they took me right away The inside was VERY clean and didn t smell a bit of nail polish remover etc The inside is decorated very sweetly and has a few manicurist stands and a few pedicure seats They have a wide range of Essie which appealed to me instantly They even had their Summer 2010 collection and a few of the Wedding collection My manicurist Lee was a gem Very sweet efficient and my manicure literally only took about 15 minutes A great job at that I will certainly return for polish changes continued manicures and I ll get a pedicure the next time too FYI student mani pedi is 40 with student ID that is wonderful for Princeton 
1z5CYH2_DfkxzVsS5hFzbA Princeton I had a similar experience with the sales pitch Upon showing up you are asked to sign in and fill a form where they collect personal information before anyone even talks to you Next you are handed a 150 dollar coupon which you will later find out you can conveniently apply towards a ridiculously high sign on fee 300 500 dollars depending on membership type Bizarrely the coupon is only valid today I also got the same 30 min long spiel despite making it clear that I knew exactly what I wanted and the spiel was unnecessary The sales staff is programmed The facilities are very good and probably meet most fitness needs but there was no way I was accepting that ridiculous unprofessional pushy sales pitch When it became apparent that I was not biting the pitch changed to assurance that this process is closely monitored implying that by signing in today and giving my information I would not get discounts in the future and if I ever change my mind and decide to sign up there s no way around paying the full price fee Not sure what Princeton Fitness is thinking but really let s remember that you are in the business of getting people healthy and NOT teaching people to make quick decisions If the center is truly interested in helping people commit to their health why should the focus be pressuring people to subscribe within two hours of learning of their fabulous services OR be penalized for slow decision making I agree with other reviewers the sales pitch was uncomfortable pushy and a total turn off I certainly regret walking into the center 
1ZVs3pBkB57AtdzfE1yNiQ Princeton Thought I d give them another try at my sister s urging so I reluctantly agreed The place was packed and we had to wait about 40 minutes for our pizza We ordered a mushroom and onion pie and when it came to the table it was well done burnt When I made a comment to the waitress she got all snotty and told us that s what we asked for We did not I would never ask for my pizza to be well done only a fool would The edges of the pizza were actually black She then again with an attitude told us they d make us another pizza but we d have to wait another 40 minutes I said no because number one we did not want to wait and number 2 I knew that that the guy making the pizza would slap his Johnson on the dough and spit a juicy honker into the sauce I asked for my money back and got it I left a nickle for the half drank soda s and a condom on the table as a tip I would never want that waitress to breed As far as I am concerned I d die of starvation before ever coming back to this red neck dump We ended up getting a great hoagie at a hoagie shop in Princeton I can see by their overall rating of 3 5 that I am not the only one complaining and they ARE NOT the excellent place they once were And to the clown who said this is not a pizzeria and is a pizza joint is full of it Some of the best pizzas in NJ are to be had in Taverns 
1_CTHSMIC70pgSTdpcIKcQ Princeton From the outside Sushi Palace looks like the kind of place where the food should kill you The stripmall ambiance does NOT inspire a lot of confidence but having eaten here 4 5 times I have found that I really enjoy the food I definitely agree with some of the other reviews that the sushi isn t of the highest quality even though it s always fresh and safe For example the texture of the tuna roll is weird because the tuna is shredded and kind of pulpy rather than a solid block of meat However the sashimi and fried rolls are good and they have some really tasty and creative rolls that feature mango and avocado Moreover you can always just pig out on seaweed salad miso soup shrimp tempura edamame and pork shu mai like we do the sushi is almost an afterthought sometimes 
1_pjvYL-0eDq9jN0d2uR4Q Princeton Nice atmosphere quick and friendly service The food is a bit overpriced but it s nice for a happy hour 
1_XhpWSYJewOQ9wrIeL93g Princeton I want to like this place I really do but having to pay to rent dvd s per day is NOT a library it s a movie store At 1 a day its basically the same as a Red Box which they also have outside Also whenever I try to get my parking validated some of the staff are rude about it treating me like I m some sort of criminal I agree with other reviewers that the library is more of a community center having many programs for kids teens ESL people and lecture series So many people take advantage of these things which is great however sometimes it can be difficult to find a place to study quietly when it gets crowded and or loud and all of the study rooms are taken The cafe is great When I get hungry I don t have to leave the place And they get a lot of their stuff made fresh from the Witherspoon Bread Company next door Also the permanent book store is great and I have seen some great deals on used books The overall design of the library is modern open and airy which has its pros and cons It has a lot of natural light and with that comes an automatic retractable solar shade that can be slightly annoying when it is always adjusting itself Also having an open tile floored staircase enables one to hear every single person going up and down I have spent much time procrastinating sitting at the tables watching the retractable shade and listening to people on the staircase Overall I would say that the library is a great place for community and baked good eating but a not so great place for silent studying reading and dvd renting 
1_zI7ZxDM5ikb_un-PQm1A Princeton Most of the stuff comes with salad bar so you don t need to order an appetizer just to stave off any intense hunger We realized this too late While the salad bar is somewhat limited you can make something decent and they have pre made salads potato salad apple salad etc The dressings aren t labeled either This is pretty much what you d expected for a mid range restaurant chain it does the job of feeding you but the food isn t majorly impressive in any way Chicken tenders 5 pieces Ketchup Couple pieces of lettuce Not much more Just as good as any fast food chain Chicken cajun gumbo heavy oily The sausage is funny tasting The shrimp overcooked A fairly large quantity of food Salsa Guac the guac is a little homogeneous not enough of that chunky avocado The salsa is too chunky simple tasteless basically diced tomato onion cilantro etc Not like a dip at all Free cheesy bread balls these were actually pretty good The bread had a decent crisp to it warm and soft on the inside good savory flavor Artichoke dip a little heavy a little salty Lava cake not super impressive The cake was a little dry 
2-OKX8TEYMFTX1PgAH6-GQ Princeton A nice simple gourmet food store It s somewhat small in size but there is a pretty good selection of foods from around the world Their prepared foods are consistently excellent as are their breads I like going to Bon Appetit before I make some of my homemade pizza they have some excellent sauces and sausages as well as some intriguing cheeses There s nothing here that you can t find at Wegmann s but it s always good to support the small local shops 
2-ximfp6q36cpyyV1iMCXw Princeton My best friend would give this 5 stars since he loves going there for used CDs And if used CDs are what you after this place is great as it has countless used CDs for no more than 3 dollars Also the blu ray section is good as well as they have several stuff that is under 20 or DVDs that are under 10 I also enjoy the music staff who are very enthuastic and astute about music They are often playing something musically interesting and I have often comment on Who is this Where can I find this While I do walk out with blurays used CD and enjoying talking to the staff I mainly go there to get vinyl and that s why I give Princeton 4 stars There is a real hit or miss when it comes to vinyl I sometimes walk in with a truckload of vinyls and other times empty handed with my friend Now that is generally true about vinyl stores but a much bigger beef I had and a major reason I do not get 5 is most of the vinyl has just come in and is rarely filed in alphabetic order or in the folder containing the performers name You have to go through new releases and or the 1 or 2 dollar bargin bin to find the record you want whereas the used CDs and blurays you don t have a problem finding anything cause everything is filed Other than the filing of vinyl this is a true music lover s delight 
20kLF7Fi0js45_CxcVQhhw Princeton We ordered Spicy Maki Combo and a Nabeyaki Udon The blandest Nabeyaki I ve ever tasted Whoever cooked this soup obviously read the description somewhere and tried to throw it together out of their not even following some kind of basic recipe instructions It was so awkwardly made and just completely wrong that I ve erased the memory out of my mind It was closer to a chinese hot pot with cabbage and noodles and no additional flavoring They had no clue what is Shichimi Nanami Togarashi or have anything similar to it to flavor the soup and make it less gross I felt taken advantage of Spicy Maki Combo was slightly below average compared to sushi around the area considering the sushi in the area isn t very good though there are a few shining exceptions Urban trash sushi with princeton prices not sure how this place will stay in business 
20LO9H8MTaA_3y6t9OTHlQ Princeton The world needs more places like Prex It s authentic it s got a good selection across many genres and there are some real steals to be found lining the walls in the back half of the store the Cheap CDs section This is great place to go burn half an hour on a lazy day Prex is what California s Amoeba Music is supposed to be 
20oBZ45yo0wa0w9TJMNF7w Princeton Sushi is good Insults are free cash register at Sakura Express I think many people now consider Sakura Express an institution of Princeton as it is known for its bargain sushi and its owners who love to tell dirty jokes on you It s true that there are a lot of regulars who love Sakura but the number of university students who frequent Sakura has nosedived since last year Prices magically went up 30 50 over the summer and for many of us who walked into Sakura the first day back on campus ready for some good grub we were quite simply hit by sticker shock My friends walked out after seeing the new prices unable to comprehend such madness I suppose most would still consider Sakura a bargain but I long for the days when I could get 3 rolls for 12 now 16 a gyu don for 5 50 now 8 50 and a salmon teriyaki for 6 50 now 10 00 The food is and always has been generous but that is not to say the quality is good If you want quality go to Ajihei I still don t advocate Ichiban under any budget circumstance But for a budget sushi meal I infinitely prefer Teriyaki Boy The rolls at Sakura are messy with rice bursting out of its seams Moreover the pickled radishes I had at the salad bar today tasted like they had gone bad or been marinated in alcohol I love that stuff and I had to throw them all out How do you f up pickled vegetables Teriyaki Boy offers better made rolls and unlike Sakura prices haven t changed in the past 5 years Side note I would avoid kitchen entrees at T Boy though I suppose Sakura will continue to thrive despite the hike in prices since patrons are usually well to do residents supplemented by new waves of unknowing freshman Eventually old farts like me will graduate and nobody will remember the good ol days so I will immortalize it in Yelp 
21_1gvyRLiYzBTscrllaZQ Princeton Very good bagels coffee and more Not the best in the area but more than edible Plus they open at 5am and are right on rt 1 can t beat that Breakfast special is the best deal around 2 eggs home fries bagel with butter and coffee for 5 Like it 
239sJ63H0Lc2pmlF6hq9WQ Princeton Amazing Indian food Best spinach dal and dahi sev poori that I ve ever had My husband had a lamb dish that he immensely enjoyed The naan was also excellent I know it s just naan but I ve had bad naan before 
23A0Kc7CQtPx_o2faENIoA Princeton Went there for lunch for our anniversary It was WAY overpriced and worse yet I walked out hungry due to puny serving sizes I ordered the deckel for 26 the best part of a rib eye steak What came out were three tiny pieces of meat each the size of my thumb FOR 26 I complained to the waiter and the manager came over to offer something additional Nice gesture but what is this let s make a deal Besides I am a firm believer in restaurants especially high end ones putting their best foot forward So they wound up NOT bringing me any sides on the house nor even trying to make it up to us with a dessert on the house we ordered and paid for two desserts Besides the taste of the food was only ok Instead I suggest saving money having equally fine cuisine AND leaving on a full stomach by visiting Eno Terra in Princteon Kingston 
23xjJHSW5ENwZ8j4wboSmg Princeton This place isn t much to look at so get your food to go That being said the food is amazing One of the best cheesesteaks I ve ever had and probably the 2nd best from NJ White House in Atlantic City would be 1 The prices are more than fair and the portion sizes are huge An order of fries easily feeds 2 people Next time though I ll skip the extra peppers and onions on my cheesesteak Wasn t really worth the extra couple of bucks since I barely noticed them 
24wsea35vu7hs9WmKmOt8w Princeton I heart Teresa s It is one of the few restaurants in Princeton that is casual fun classy and AFFORDABLE all at the same time And it s absolutely delish Whenever I want to have a nice dinner out without breaking the bank my friends and I inevitably gravitate towards Teresa s charming friendly and totally delicious pastas pizzas They have two kitchens one open where they make all of their pizza and another in back where they handle all of the other foods If I m feeling broke I usually go for the pizzas as they are definitely on a lower price spectrum than the pastas The pizzas 9 13 are thin beauties with a slightly chewy crust with fresh high quality toppings Sometimes I wish the crust were slightly charred a la Old World but that is more a personal preference Usually though I go straight for the pastas 12 18 My favorite is the Conchiglie Balsamico a deliciously creamy dish with a tang of shell shaped pasta with slivers of asparagus and tender chicken It s a dish with innovative flavors though the sauce may not appeal to everyone I suggested it once to my mom s friend who wasn t a fan but everyone else I know has liked it I also like the Linguine Vongole and Penne all Arrabbiata with more straightforward flavors but cooked very well none the less They also like to use organic ingredients so don t be surprised if you see Raised Right chicken or Simply Grazin beef I think it s a little snobby but the names themselves are pretty humorous in and of themselves Also if you like nutella the dessert pizza is yummm Sure conceptually the dish is ridiculously simple but can you make a pizza crust like Teresa can No probably not In short while in NY I would probably rate Teresa s a solid 4 this is really as good as it gets without breaking the bank at Princeton 
24y-wk3YeQVXSbMubeCdhw Princeton I should confess that I am currently sprawled out on the sofa in my hotel room holding my tummy and making happy yummy noises This is due to the fact that we wandered into downtown Princeton tonight and ate dinner at the Witherspoon Grill The WG as the locals call it is located next to the library in the quaint little town surrounding the famous university Reservations are required for inside seating but they have a nice covered patio space which allows for al fresco dining Live jazz was playing inside so the ambience was quite nice despite the oppressive heat humidity My business partner and I took our clients to dinner and between the five of us we happily mowed our way through appetizers steaks chops sides and desserts over a leisurely evening Our server was terrific making many helpful suggestions filling the glasses and bread basket and enhancing the dining experience without disrupting our business conversations I started with a cup of lobster bisque which was perfectly seasoned with nice chunks of lobster meat in the soup That was followed by the dry aged strip steak seared on the outside for a nice crust and then pink and juicy in the center Creamed spinach for the side with a healthy dose of garlic I m not normally one for desert but our server recommended a vanilla caramel ice cream sprinkled with sea salt which was made across the street at an organic sweets shop The bill for the five of us was 250 which included the tip Certainly not an outrageous cost for such a terrific meal Great place for a dinner date or an expense account treat insert happy yummy noises here 
25OD1VrndkRSQBpoSX7e-Q Princeton I remember going to this place the day it opened we went over to Bambergers I think where Lord and Taylors is It was ok back then t was the late 70 s early 80 s space port arcade was my hang out I even worked over at Friendly s during high school But now everyone that ever lived in NJ moved because the people from NY and Philly came in with their crappy attitudes and would kick their old grandmother if she got in their way So you will definitely feel that vibe in there It went through several mismanagement companies who spent most of their time chasing kids instead of figuring out ways to encourage community spirit today s kids are tomorrow s customers If you really want to go to a decent Mall and you re visiting Market Fair has always been good and even though the Nassau Park Shopping place is a parking nightmare it s still better than Quaker Bridge Ok one plus you never ever have to worry about getting a parking space except Christmas time ok maybe Christmas time too I estimate in about 10 years from now they ll either tear it down and start over or tear it down and put up more office buildings or developments because damn you know New Jersey needs more of that sarcasm very thick like syrup Oh btw while you people are freezing your asses off I m sitting here in my shorts on my porch underneath some palm trees drinking a tall cool one 
27IQt2TWrlpSe3xCgw-DyA Princeton Oh my goodness Before I moved to Princeton last year I had heard about this little ice cream place from a NJ native co worker of mine This place definitely lives up to the hype The type of ice cream is Italian style gelato and sorbet with some typical flavors i e vanilla bean mango blood orange and lots of creative and unique flavors such as lavender mascarpone cocoa nib basil turkish coffee and my personal favorite bourbon vanilla sea salt caramel Heavenly 
28DFLF0ufm1iZt6mGLo3VQ Princeton Elements was recommended to me by a good friend He would be pleased and not so pleased with my experience I had lunch The appetizer was really lovely a Dandelion Gazpacho which came with a preserved lemon ice cream hazelnut bits cucumber shavings and rosemary flowers Spectacular It was bitter and smooth the flower flavor was so delicate and gave the dish a great green snap The hazelnut added a little crunch along with two very crunchy croutons With this I had a glass of the NV Zardetto Prosecco which went perfectly as it was dry Then came the main course pork belly with shrimp The small variety of shrimp were perfectly cooked The spicy sauce was very spicy and the little on the plate went a long way There was a cashew butter sauce as well which had a nice cooling effect However I didn t understand the pork belly at all Most people love the crisp melt in your mouth quality of pork belly This was not crisp It was not seasoned It was like a lump of fat on the plate hard hard to chew not heated not easy to cut with the knife provided Such a shame I would give this restuarnt another chance Sous Chef Mike Ryan is part of the Williams Sonoma Sou Chef Series and I just got his recipe for Mushroom Soup which I can t wait to try Also the waiter rushed me out the door I hate when that happens So two bad marks on an otherwise great visit 
28UpfZDyuxAP3dz98f_XYg Princeton My wife and I have been recommending the Blue Point Grill for years The seafood is fresh and the prices are reasonable It addition the place is BYOB When dining here we usually start our meal with oysters which are excellent We have dined here over the years at least a dozen times Myself I usually opt for the Branzini which is a mild Mediterranean fish The place is rather small with seating outside during the summer when the weather permits Sometimes they also have small groups of musicians playing outside So you can enjoy a bottle of wine while waiting for your table Parking is usually hard to find on the street but they have a small parking on the side between the restaurant and the Ivy Inn which is next door The Ivy is a dive bar but you can get a good cocktail here before your meal Once seated you enjoy a great meal without being rushed for the next seating 
29olqrpbAP3oQJAG0Jhf8A Princeton It s good yogurt but I have had some problems there first of all on a hot day you have to buy something just to get a glass of water and second of all you have to buy something just to use the bathroom UGHHHHH 
2A6cF-wGNq6QHySwHKQDOA Princeton Small place but excellent ice cream A bit expensive but quality makes up for it 
2A9Y3J2UIQi7DlTNTcAgOA Princeton Boring run down typical cheep chineese food service was slow at best We had to ask for more tea since after the food was delivered they never came back to the table Go elsewhere 
2AkrlDqKpS5WfMbCduQ5Hg Princeton Cramped space high turnover public restrooms 
2Azc--Jtqb-Aj1qKTRT3Mg Princeton Very pleasant experience What you see is what you get Yes the price is on the high side but the quality and guilt free feeling you get after eating the pizza is worth the premium Would eat again 
2azp49im-BsnxUdddoGdqw Princeton Love this store Tony Sethi is the owner and customer service is 1 Our family has 4 wireless phones and we have been customers for years Personalized service rarely a wait to get help and the customer does come first They are located in Plainsboro Town Center on Schalks Crossing Road next to the Constitution Bank and near Its a Grind Coffee House I wouldn t go anywhere else 
2B2_LeFL7o_Qsj7dHXPecw Princeton Tasty and good A bit pricey 
2B3Vzn_AVR4-KW8jWb1iyA Princeton I work in town and have just started going here for lunch Although it is pretty crowded during the lunch rush it s perfect for a late 2 00 lunch I m hooked on the Pizzettas especially the one with Arugula Prosciutto I would highly recommend them if you want great food at a reasonable price 
2bfkHHhVXWWGwjbeRIMDGA Princeton I would absolutely suggest getting your shoes fitted here they really know what they are doing it is the complete opposite of a place like dicks 
2BkmyzwdEI8UVjCO2eXXFw Princeton yumm great chicken gyros under 5 cheese fries sandwiches and tons of other food they have a pretty cheap and fast to go their cheese steak is huge they have a decent drink selection and you can sit outside after you get your food on a nice day on the benches 
2brFXEBGBE9kmuNhIbx6Vw Princeton I think J B Winberie s was the very first restaurant I visited in Princeton some 20 years ago while there visiting former student It struck me then as it does now as the quintessential Ivy League college town eatery pub somehow exactly what you would think that would be with lot of wood and that pub in the cellar sort of feel Was back this time to visit yet another student so we stopped here for a quick meal on a Sunday evening Split a great salad and had a fabulous burger that was juicy and loaded with things that are particularly good for you The menu is quite extensive but with so many artsy restaurants in the neighborhood this doesn t seem like the place you d want to go for chicken cordon blue Not sure that was on the menu but you get my drift A really good sandwich burger and beer place is what THIS is 
2ClIBsWLfj_E15lePLxiIQ Princeton I had heard from several people that this place was really good I had lunch there on a Friday afternoon around 2pm and it was wonderful This place offers a much more refined experience than your average pizza shop It is relatively small however they offer outside seating in the back on the patio which is quite lovely The variety of choices is very nice and especially the fact that the owner seems to go out of his way to use ingredients that are natural and organic as much as possible My friend and I shared the Antonia la Caprisiossa pizza my half without the salami along with the heirloom beet salad Fresh crispy and delicious Along with Blueberry ice tea and a lemonade our total bill was 35 Service was really great and quite friendly Recommended 
2D0TSrdCRJhIBh2XI85YDQ Princeton Excellent chai tea Excellent atmosphere Lovely place to meet or just be mellow The real deal They import directly and learned how to prepare their own recipes by travelling to India Unique and worth it Did I mention this is an excellent spot to spend some time Nice menu as well such as hummus apple and date dishes chinese eggs way too cool And it is decorated very nicely They spen time laying this out Just had some house chai a few minutes ago House chai and the other chais are stronger the way I like it the various tea lattes are also very nice Go there already 
2dLn6PZJaUqZViK1DHap8Q Princeton My husband and I ate here almost every Friday night this past Summer There was no wait then but we ve been afraid to try it now that the students are back in session The sushi quality is superb The kitchen can get backed up but the wait staff is lovely I m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the decor is lacking and the menu has no variety Given the setting it s a bit expensive 
2do-SE2Q3uFPNNrmpL-aXg Princeton I might not be an expert on Japanese food but I ve tried many restaurants in the area and this one cannot be beat in my book Maybe it s not authentic but I love their chicken teriyaki and they boast a huge menu of sushi that covers the gamut The staff are friendly and the sushi chef is a pro not to mention interesting to watch and interact with 
2dw6spvN1AA2EUBo0nsptg Princeton My first pedi was in Boulder CO and since then I ve been trying to find a salon that measures up to that Pink Nails is as everyone has pointed out efficient though kind of pricey Though there s another price paid for efficiency upon closer examination there were definitely slivers of nail that were left unpainted Not exactly the best work And I wish they would really go to town on exfoliating your feet instead of a few feathery cursory passes with the pumice brush What s the point if your feet are just as calloused as when you came in You want to be steppin pretty in summer sandals 
2DWY7UoHw5hpmltzWMv_bQ Princeton It s just so fun to go in there I feel like I m exploring The produce section is limited and the prices on the expensive side However 2 for Charles Shaw I brought my father here and he enthusiastically bought 12 bottles The coffee and the snack items are spectacular Price is better than Whole Foods not that I shop there anyway since organic and or GF has yet to make a point with me 
2d_OArOriNW8ay_gbipkrA Princeton Wow Princeton is a beautiful campus Was here this past weekend and toured around the campus for a bit Loved how the entire campus literally felt so old school like it was brimming with history Most of the buildings seem consistent in architecture and design you get a sense of uniformity though it varies a bit It s consistent without being identical Cold weather aside it d be a great place for leisurely stroll or a photo shoot Also caught a glimpse of cherry blossoms around campus as well as squirrels 
2EEifvHQqUwYA3Y4pVWphA Princeton wow The best Homemade pasta great food romantic and great wine list Love it 
2eESZ2xj1HTZgyImR1asNA Princeton Grew up in Princeton best ice cream and cupcakes I ve ever had Very innovative flavors I d say my favorite combination is still blood orange sorbet and vanilla bean ice cream Their special flavors are beyond good though too who would have thought basil ice cream was good They use whatever is in season and make it delicious Even if you don t think you ll like it you can have free tastes of whatever you want Explore your taste buds Up scale restaurants all over New Jersey buy Bent Spoon ice cream to serve for dessert And even though I m still in college and this is a long way off I am 100 sure my wedding cake will consist of layers of Bent Spoon cupcakes Such fresh ingredients and perfect recipes Highly recommended Puts Thomas Sweet and House of Cupcakes to shame 
2eLsbKIX0LerVrQwH2z4FQ Princeton This place isn t anything special but we find ourselves going there a lot because its one of the most convenient when walking around Princeton its not toooo stuffy although its still in Princeton so you know never have to wait for a table and for our single friends there is usually a crowd of other singles for them to mingle albeit cramped mingling with Beer isn t too expensive appetizers are good for vegetarians although I don t think I ve ordered anything but apps I like the cheese dip with apples Overall its a pretty casual place thats nice and centrally located 
2eqoHt7cfYkUVaUSK7BhdQ Princeton Very very very cool place The best part besides the perfect smell for a place like this is the very cool and helpful staff All very nice very down to earth people that work here and will show you a lot of cool new bands artists to check out 
2eQz7y4wtdhSBv3yhxf6eA Princeton Everyone s always talking about this place so I decided to finally try it I was expecting to be bedazzled by a sub but ended up being disappointed by a mediocre cheesesteak I don t get why this place is so hyped up I mean i ll try another sub next time perhaps one of the more famous ones but I m not a fan so far Maybe it s a Jersey thing 
2es3-bgTb5fYb8CMjR2HfQ Princeton Best restaurant in town and around Great food great staff Their cheese steak and wings are bomb 
2etLyfji3kY9VTh0UoVQxQ Princeton Main Street Bistro has been a longtime fixture at the Princeton Shopping center and continues to provide very good dining at a very fair price We go often to MSB to avoid the higher priced mediocrity you ll find in Princeton Favorites here include the lamb sliders really excellent the monthly changing of the menu to include new dishes outside dining in the warmer months and the new cabana bar to enjoy a drink or more 
2eUe1nL7-sA9ZzWWW9mQgg Princeton Ever since I could drive into Princeton proper I ve been going to Thomas Sweet Ice Cream and it s where my wife and I come for a sweet when we visit my home town Its one of those places where you just feel good coming back to Of course the ice cream is great and the bend ins are what I got when I was younger and what kept me coming back to Thomas Sweet time and time again But the atmosphere is good too While there isn t a lot of room inside the place and lines can get long out the door and down the street long on summer nights there is a lot of outdoor seating which lets most people sit and enjoy their creamy desserts Plus with all the benches around town and the University you ll find a spot to relax in no time The funny mirror from years ago and the mural on the wall all make Thomas a place the entire family can enjoy Now the important part the ice cream I can t have sugar any more so I always get the fat sugar free soft ice creams But I never feel without because they rotate their flavors often this past weekend they had fat sugar free Pumpkin for example Coffee Peanut Butter Vanilla and Chocolate are all usually there on my menu Of the fat sugar free ice creams I ve had in town theirs is by far the best But when I could eat sugary foods Thomas blend ins were my oyster Virtually any flavor of ice cream and nearly any type of topping made endless possibilities that I savored each time And they rotate their flavors too So you re easily tempted to try new and unique flavors like cake batter ginger snap a favorite of mine although not inspiring was Cookies n Cream with Reese s Peanut Butter Cups Yum The prices are good Service is great And the memories will keep me coming to this place time and time again While the other ice cream places are good too Thomas Sweet actually draws me back into the borough more so than Small World A B and my other college day haunts You can t go wrong with them 
2EvnNfRvIbKzWtvSbLA3ZQ Princeton This is my favorite steakhouse in the area I can honestly say I ve never had a bad meal here I usually get the prime rib and the KC fries are really good too The ambiance is nice as well Quiet and kind of swanky It s not the cheapest place you can find in the area that s one drawback I guess But compared to other high end steakhouses I prefer it 
2f23GlATB4KKhbQSL6Mo6A Princeton WOW what an experience The food and spirits were amazing Had the watermelon salad and morrocan scallops which was incredible For dessert had three tiny scoop of the most unbelievable bent spoon Creations Thought I had died and went to heaven Was not your run of the mill check either 125 00 for two with 2 drinks All in all a gastronomical treat 
2FZ3RmagHDMIZEWf4mjuTg Princeton Amazing selection of CD s DVD s LPs for under 5 bucks They have music from all genres and all eras so you re sure to find something you love or forgot you loved 
2f_XKFMP7oiYIeBm7zsrqg Princeton 24 7 good coffee good drink selection salads sandwiches and pretty much every grocery item you can normally think of May I add that the hoagies sandwiches here are ridiculously good and cheap and they pretty much have everything you ll need including random items such as batteries and bug repellent It s a one stop shop with delicious hoagies Try one if you re in town 
2g0PDwuc1mKkIs_fij3jIA Princeton Nice servers but painfully slow Food is good but relatively overpriced fOr the area 
2gaIFNc2i-uz7AMVWLomHg Princeton Love their food stylish interior and the service is always great Love it here 
2gzJBxOO9NzVcBMtyEZO-A Princeton Pros Bartenders and Waitstaff are excellent Menu is dynamic and usually done well Managers seem to care which matters Obviously the alcohol is a draw but the food and open face chicken sandwich and calamari especially are brilliant Cons hard to get a seat they can get real snooty about bar area stools requiring full dinner orders Hostess quality is as bad as the bartender staff is good amazing to have such a disparity Price can vary rapidly across the menu Still a decent place if you have a reservation or can somehow catch it on a quiet night Decent people watching at worst part of a great princeton bar crawl at best 
2H6BBD0ylFGXQRgkfs376A Princeton The name of this restaurant kind of misled me to think of what I would imagine this place to be I thought this place was a noodle specialty place selling udon ramen wonton etc Instead this place is just a standard low end Chinese restaurant The place is not all that clean Waiters are rude and you feel rushed Food its meh All in all just a standard Chinese restaurant nothing special Don t waste your time here unless you are in the mood for cheap Chinese food FYI This place accepts cash only 
2hbrgmJaJKEVDlKjHNs-gw Princeton When you are in the burbs it s so hard to find a good restaurant among the landscape of chains I have been coming to Sahara Restaurant since I was little and it was my introduction to Middle Eastern food Perhaps my 4 star rating is slightly bias because of this connection to it but I still think the food is rather good I actually would probably rate it lower if it were the same place in the city but given the lack of good eats around here they get a boost I have never had a bad meal here but I dislike that they don t let you order sandwiches later in the day and that it must be platters Sometimes I m just not that hungry The decor has barely changed since I was a kid I remember they renovated at some point but it doesn t look that much better 
2hIwlEEBGkUUan_mOjGJVA Princeton Went here once a few months ago and was not impressed at all I thought the food was mediocre Not only that but I was baffled when the bill came and it was around 150 for two people A BYO sushi place Really Way over priced Well last night we made the mistake of giving it another try and ordered a couple traditional entrees a couple of apps and one roll for takeout The Spicy Roll was awful and laying in a mayo sauce The chicken in the chicken lettuce wraps looked like ground up dog food with unidentifiable things added in Fried tofu pieces I suppose 90 later for a typical Friday night in and I ve finally learned my lesson We won t be back I m sticking with Yummi Sushi 
2Hmg7DtpbvjkibfVx18M6w Princeton Very pleased with my haircut 
2hpeUNnM99PxJzkPWxlvwg Princeton Good selection of snacks pre made and made on the spot For newbies you order sandwiches with the touch screens They also have TP and other necessities if it s an emergency and you can t make it to the grocery store I used the ATM here all the time because I wasn t charged by PNC or my bank for withdrawals When my boyfriend would visit me in Princeton Wawa was a must stop on the list so he could get a Buffalo Chicken sandwich The coffee is pretty darn delicious From 6 9AM It s pretty packed with the work crowd either catching the train or working at the university I m also a fan of the slushes and their selection of juices and iced tea This place is PACKED late at night as students return from the eating clubs It s also pretty busy during the lunch rush Be prepared to wait a bit longer 20 minutes for your sandwich during the busy times In summary Cheap good quick food 
2hQ-NjsU15wJYP6s3KqzKQ Princeton Let s get this out of the way I don t like chain restaurants generally I avoid them If there are more than 5 6 of a place I do not eat there Until on a trip to California someone took me to a PF Chang s for dinner Wow Best chain place EVER I loved the food Then I tried the one closest to my home in Princeton home run Outta the park I ve eaten at a couple more all consistent and excellent I m a fan this is a great place to dine Highly recommended 
2hRr-r6vfWx7N7A277ujww Princeton Just moved to the area recently and went here based on a friend s recommendation Great men s haircuts and very friendly staff Located in a convenient strip mall so that makes it even better 
2Htn4OeujGpgtZ5dX3G03A Princeton I have a hard time rating Chinese restaurants because I so rarely find them to be distinctive from one another I was pleasantly surprised walking into Shanghai Park as small door gives little indication of the spacious well lit interior I had heard they have good bubble tea here so I ordered a Black Tea w milk right away I was not disappointed The tea was sweet not watery and the bubbles big and squishy The meal itself was unremarkable as a majority of American Asian cuisine tends to be It was satisfactory for a casual dinner amongst friends but I wouldn t take my grandparents here on their anniversary Although I will be back for more Bubble Tea 
2hWLd4ZPdvk4JtYUlHq7lg Princeton Best steaks in the continent carne asada 
2i9x5CjjQLbaM_JwL2oeLA Princeton After moving away from Princeton this place is the one I miss most New CDs are ok priced and regular used selection is solid What makes this place an absolute gem are the cheap CDs usually between 1 99 4 99 In most CD stores these CDs tend to be garbage At PREX you ll find an eclectic mix of genres musicals classical jazz international etc represented I ve found many CDs for 3 99 that would be closer to 20 if I tried to seek them out Lots of rare and obscure stuff Easy to spend more than an hour and more than 100 if you re not careful but it s worth it 
2I9xSncVoLLyMpa9f6rPIA Princeton This place is weeeeeeak Food is bland It is NOT a taste of Mexico I could make better food on my own at home Chips were saltless Salsa tasted like spaghetti sauce Guac was made fresh was the best thing but was nothing to write home about Don t waste your time or money on this place 
2IGDb-7yc8FMCz1hFt1-tQ Princeton Went there for my anniversary and my wife LOVED it perhaps my opinion doesn t really matter if I scored points with the better half The food was nice albeit smallish serving sizes no surprise we opted for a five course menu Overall I did enjoy it but my only reservation is that it s pricey 
2IRSrwsCSFfmQZAyjxHJ3A Princeton A family visit to Princeton yesterday How could we have not stopped in for some of the best Pancakes around So glad we ate here yesterday The taste texture and everything everything about em From the Buttermilk pancakes to the Fresh Blueberry Pancakes to the Bannana Pancakes all 4 of us were in agreement the best Not our first visit won t be the last 
2J5wxMjU9d68JvxToUpmUA Princeton I saw a review for KC Prime and decided to jump in with a quick one from me I rarely eat red meat but when I crave it this is really the only place that will work I ve been here for dinners weekdays and weekends with my family including a 2 5 year old at the time friends and business Always good Service is attentive but not overbearing Good portion of veggies on the side with my steaks I don t think I ve ever made it to dessert that will have to be a goal next time I go Our table was always ready within 5 minutes of the reservation time and if we decided to stop at the bar for drinks first they held the table for us 
2jLkwK-ZUYD-7ohAtpUWxA Princeton Went here for the first time a few days ago walked in and got a seat at the bar right away We ordered food to go the fish tacos were SLAMMIN Definitely would go back again for the food The beer was good and the waiter was friendly Overall chilled out environment but might be different on busy nights weekends 
2jOilMd04yX7DSB5zWivZA Princeton Don t know why most reviews give this place such low ratings I ts not great but it s definitely decent Been here a myriad times and never was disappointed Yes it s not a great place but it s most solid with good food and drinks 
2jU0j9dEUL3fgwi47Miplw Princeton On the positive side the food was very good but maybe we were more hungry than usual and the service was fast It s a small restaurant with a good decor The menu has lots of words to explain each style of cooking you can get a good education on Indian foods and their origins by reading the menu On the negative side the bathroom was absolutely filthy much like a nasty service station bathroom that s never cleaned The toilet seat was broken trash basket was overflowing paper towels were on the floor and your feet stick to the floor We were one of the first customers at this restaurant on this day so one cannot blame the state of the bathroom on it being used by a herd of pigs just beforehand Hope their kitchen is cleaner than their bathroom No liquor license so BYOB 
2kb8bXIvZod33p_4kdgp8w Princeton The lobster mac and cheese is the only way I will ever eat lobster And I don t love lobster You need to go here And they have arguably the best gourmet burger in the area Service was good prices were expected to be high the wine selection was nice I had a wonderful time Go there if you wanna cheat on your diet with your girlfriends and some drinks 
2kc2sImbzuQ3zuM5y8S0YA Princeton I think people actually live in Small World every single time i step foot into this coffee shop i see the same regulars just in different clothing and sometimes at different tables My goal to achieve that level of regular The staff is veeeery nice and friendly And they are talented too they make an amazing cappucino My favorite times in small world are either when i m reading a book in some secluded corner or listening to live music with a few other people while drinking a cup of joe And indeed it is a small world because everytime i go in i see someone i know 
2KNVY6c8SZUdljqyPnWHuA Princeton Some people say that this is too formal but I would say it s somewhere in between casual and upscale The best time to go is on Wednesday or Thursday night when Arturo Romay is playing guitar Sit near the bar and have a glass of wine or a cocktail Call me before so I can meet you Mediterra has an excellent wine list and friendly bar staff If you re not up for a meal their appetizers are quite tasty Another wonderful place is to sit outside day or night I know people criticize their food but I have never had a bad dining experience It s a good date spot because the lighting is flattering I once saw Gov John Corzine here on a Sunday night with his posse before his accident 
2m37yfmWydxacRPfxad7FQ Princeton Let me start off by saying that I ve been to PF Changs in general probably 8 9 times in the past After last night s experience though I think I m done This place is too trendy pricey and overrall full of itself to get my money any longer I went with family last night and it was for the first time empty I can only hope people finally realized it is not as good as the hype and the trend is dying down Having had good experience with their fish entrees I ordered the Ginger Salmon Considering it s name I thought it would have a ginger flavor Nope it didn t The waitress took it back and upon the manager s recommendations they put in an order for the Grilled Salmon asparagus something Now why they couldn t just redo the Ginger Salmon I don t know The manager brought the new one out of course everyone at my table was already done eating apologized and told me I will love this new dish and it is full of flavor Umm nope This one was the exact same as the last one except they grilled the crap out of it Ugh What is going on with this place Usually everything is salty but at least that is some kind of a flavor They took it off the bill which was nice it was an 18 50 entree with no flavor but come on I don t recommend this place considering it s not authentic everything is crazy overpriced the staff is slow and drinks are ridiculously priced too and apparently their cooking staff and management are idiots My bf loves this place but after this he can go there alone Oh and I agree with another poster Instead go to Sunny Garden which is a short walk away behind the Pep Boys That is a great place for authentic Asian fare Screw PF Wangs 
2n4HeFSMCrbb3BZkvYxCbQ Princeton I went here about a year ago and by the looks of the reviews not much has changed The place was attached to the hotel which always seems like it s not going to be as good as it would be if it was a stand still place I had gone on Valentine s Day but late around 8 30 it wasn t that busy and we had a reservation It took 10 15 minutes to sit and another 10 minutes for the waiter to come over for our orders I remember the food wasn t even that good for the price and it took FOREVER for our food our waiter sucked badly I thought it was an more upscale place I was wrong We had a coupon for a certain amount of money off if we spend like 100 and they told us that they had to put gratuity on it because of the coupon I m pretty sure that s bullshit he just wanted a good tip which he did not deserve I left feeling like it wasn t worth my time I wouldn t recommend this place There are much better places to eat that are just down Route 1 Especially if you re going for steak it s not worth it 
2N73Qm_9KbUk1jlLjBIxCw Princeton It s a greasy sandwich place Check that It s THE greasy sandwich place I m completely biased in that I went to Princeton and my formative Haven experiences were spent largely intoxicated Simply perfect food at 1 59am they close at 2 If it were possible to give bonus points for being optimal drunk food I d give them to the Haven I still live in the area and still have the opportunity to have a nostalgic hoagie every now and then Even sober they re great They re not haute cuisine They re great crappy sandwiches if that makes sense In my 15 years of Havening I ve only had about a half dozen things on the menu First of all contrary to some other reviewers opinions if you re getting a cold sandwich you re wasting your time Because I m old I ve been thoroughly scared of the new offerings Sanchez etc Cheesesteak Pizza cheesesteak Bacon cheesesteak Hot pastrami Chicken parm and the omelet subs That s it For 15 years on and off a greasy hole in the wall has had me happily coming back for one of six sandwiches I think that s telling enough Just get everything on whatever you order if you re new There is a good natured soup nazi vibe in that the other customers ll get pissed if you don t keep the line moving Rightfully so The hot gooey goodness of any of the hot subs will totally disintegrate the bread in about 5 minutes Time is of the essence If you want a fancy expensive sandwich and I have no problem with that there are about a dozen places in town you can go If you want satisfying gullet filling greasyness Hoagie Haven is the only game in town 
2nc2Hexf5i0MCElq_UURag Princeton Excellent service and superb food The restaurant is a little noisy but the quality of the food compensates for this 
2Nq__JTxM77tgY0qPlTSVg Princeton Best Mexican in Princeton I wouldn t say it exactly satisfies the craving but it quiets it a bit Pretty good mole sauce rice and beans generally large portions Solid but not authentic enough I do like the casual atmosphere and it s actually a relaxing walk from downtown on a nice night 
2N_UuLABu4KNdivfPQbetQ Princeton I like Asian Bistro it is the only Korean food in the area 10 mile proximity I m willing to pay for and outshines its older sibling Nassau Sushi in taste ambiance and staff friendliness There is a bountiful photo menu most of which looks good but I find the Korean dishes most appealing Besides food there is a pretty awesome soda selection including sparkling spring water way to go far out of reach sodas and free barley tea It has an interior I appreciate and outside seating too if the train tracks don t bother Keep this local gem alive visit soon 
2o20EX34Mzff2b34I6H1SQ Princeton Caveat I am a black coffee purist so I cannot comment on milky lattes and other such coffee beverages As for their coffee however I think it is great Don t tell Starbucks but I have been cheating on them more and more lately I love that the Starbucks on Nassau St got a Clover machine recently and have been enjoying the reserve coffees there but Small World s coffees are just as good House blend is a reliable go to Also enjoyed the organic love blend I usually take my joe to go so I can t say much about the atmosphere Typical coffee shop in a college town I suppose Staff are always friendly This is a great place to get a cup of coffee when the Starbucks rut has you down and you can t stand the line 
2p9CNrw45AQoJjxzDTdUow Princeton This place was an amazing find off the beaten path on the outskirts of downtown Princeton NJ My wife and I found this place and gave it a shot over the other Italian places in our area WE WERE AMAZED AT HOW GOOD IT WAS Everything is great including the romantic environment and music Its an open kitchen so you can see the cook and the rest of the staff moving around Make sure to get the chicken parmigiana its the best in all of NJ 
2P9Prz3kceBmnoQUJfsRxw Princeton Daniel Smits Salon is my favorite I don t go anywhere else The decor is simple clean and hip The staff is friendly and helpful And most importantly Dan is the best I don t trust anyone else with my difficult hair I highly recommend it 
2pjRCIrJX_jFTyluV2zENQ Princeton A veritable pantheon of Italian culinary delights It certainly took me some time to get a full appraisal of all the terrific options Everything looked fresh and delicious and I settled on a sandwich which was sliced and made to order Some of the best mortadella I ve had since living in Italy My family had been driving a half hour to our preferred Italian deli but we might have a new place 
2pXQsgN_8-NLLMSuJRo4lg Princeton A breath of fresh or at least coffee filled air in Princeton Affordable down to earth and filled with yum A bit noisy if you re on your laptop but hey at least it s not aseptic I just wanted to use a big word so all these Princeton people think I m smart 
2QTPC8r2B8065bcQvykM8g Princeton Still the best 
2RGqO-qFNYHAXVDX0wFh_Q Princeton Love this little place It s a manageable supemarket without the weird vibe of many health food stores Full of just plain good stuff They stock a lot of local meat dairy and produce and point it out A must stop for locavores 
2rU9V7vy8EGt7_tTfAywMA Princeton Dinner at the Bar Review Came here after a coworker a former Princeton ite and another coworker suggested this place as a place to catch AP on MNF Rollin Han Solo style I sat at the bar the pre game show was on with no sound and a Jammin slow jam playing in the background By Jammin I mean completely inappropriate for MNF No worries though the bartender turned up the volume on one of the TVs so balance but not hide the jammin slow jam in the background Ordered the Mediterranean Pasta with Chicken Muy Excellente I must say Quite enjoyed the penne pasta with chicken olive oil capers sun dried tomatoes and olives Was kind of sad to hear after I was drinking my Guinness that they had a 3 Tall Coors Light special I guess I had to be a local or at least just smart enough to ask do you have any specials to find out what they re specials are I enjoyed my time there could see myself venturing here if I was a local 
2sKrwWrs7W6VeoEL6w6_aw Princeton Nice facility good location and friendly staff I took the boxing class over the weekend with instructor Pat and I am addicted i haven t used the machines at this location in a few years so I cannot comment on their condition Locker room seemed clean but I only popped in there very quickly 
2sO7a59-J8MfSIwauO2OAQ Princeton Good find Easy and cheap rental I dont think we even paid til we brought it back and didn t even leave ID or anything Its fun for an hour or two but the canal itself gets a bit boring after awhile Very pretty in parts though The only thing is they really need to wash the life preservers if you can do that Mine was pretty stinky But it was good to see they had plenty of them and plenty of kayaks 
2tk3ePveKGHcsPUKb_wYsg Princeton I ve stayed here a couple of times After you check in here they give you this warm cookie that comes out of some secret oven under the check in counter I m tempted to walk around the counter and see if there are little Keebler elves or something under there making them They are totally awesome cookies Unfortunately you only get one The staff here has always been very friendly Rooms are clean and basic However the towels are in some serious need of fabric softener They are hard as hell I accidentally hit my eye with the edge of a washcloth last time and thought my eye was going to fall out 
2To75PCb6Q2dgTbfhkZXiA Princeton My second favorite ice cream place in Princeton They have a larger variety than that of Bent Spoon with lots of traditional favorites shakes coffee bakery etc If I m with kids or finicky people or if it is later at night The Bent Spoon closes earlier I ll head here Especially if I m buying because it is cheap I love the prices because you can buy a gang of four hehe ice cream for under ten bucks Lovely There is sometimes live music in the summertime The decor is very fun it s like an old barn but without the smell 
2Mf3F2OuPgPUG9FF6MXrBw Urbana I am from Champaign raised there until the age of 20 when I escaped to Austin I still go back every year for Christmas to visit family and friends and when I do Seven Saints is a must hit place for food And I get the same thing every single time The Triple S Combo Platter One salmon slider BLT salad although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad sounds weird but was really tasty And the tomato basil soup This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off possibly a bad day But every year it always pleases me And the bill isn t so bad I don t really drink here but have had a mojito that was alright nothing special I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting Please stay in business Seven Saints otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won t be pretty 
2mZDfcy6E2SMaTv-UZWr1g Urbana Geovanti s is the best place on campus to get your deep fried grease fix Don t expect health food or vegetarian options because the very blue collar cooks throw everything in the deep fryer This place bills itself as a bar and grill but the nightlife is mediocre at best On Friday night usually there are usually 3 or 4 guys in the basement bar sipping cheap American light beer 
2N1FEdeZtlPMKALiUJeHXg Urbana I had heard about this place about 6 months before I tried it out and I m mad at myself for missing out for so long The food is affordable for a student on a budget and the atmosphere is perfect for a date or group outing It s the perfect place for students to bring their visiting parents too The beer comes in sizes ranging from 4oz to 16oz so you can try different brews if you re in the mood for that The Tomato Bread salad is absolutely phenomenal and I have added chicken to it and had that as my entree on more than one occasion This is one restaurant I really miss since graduating U of I and leaving the area 
2NB6Dx7D7jypvRiZhQiW9A Urbana I ve gotten decent mochas from this place before different location the one at Village at the Crossing but one thing that is disappointing is that their small is not equal to a Tall from Starbucks It s really small But since the prices are elevated I don t like to get more than a small at one time Secondly my boyfriend and I stopped in to get some drinks on our way to do another errand The girl was friendly and served us right away albeit impatiently because she was also working the drive thru He got some kind of frap thing and I got a small hot chocolate I specifically asked the girl How is your hot chocolate Of course she said oh it s very good We re halfway down the street with our drinks when I finally try the hot chocolate First of all the whipped cream is actually very good It s real whipped cream That s where it ends The hot chocolate was ALL milk It just tasted like hot milk with some kind of oily residue in it I was really displeased and couldn t take more than a few sips I poured it out on the ground and it was all milk with a couple of shots of syrup at the bottom that didn t mix in whatsoever It was a waste of money and did nothing to reassure me that it s a good place to go for drinks Complete aside but this is also annoying they don t give you a cardboard sleeve for your drink automatically You have to burn your hand to walk over to the counter to get your own sleeve My boyfriend liked his frap but I tried it and thought it was below average I hate to say it but I hope a Starbucks opens up in some convenient area of Champaign sometime soon They give you sleeves automatically too 
2nfGZbYMYaAvQwHI4bDjqg Urbana Like the other reviewer I m a 30 y o male who just wanted a pretty simple haircut w no styling There was a little bit of a wait but no more than 10 15 minutes The stylist understood just what I was looking for and I was all done in about 15 minutes The rate has gone up slightly from the 2007 review the price is now 11 on Tuesdays but this price also applies on Wed which is pretty great A fine haircut in the C U area for cheap means I ll be back in about 45 days for another one 
2nj4SrKu7DS2q0qwpg-i9A Urbana It can be good it can be bad Never attempt to order food for delivery from here It will take well over an hour and be ice cold and mushy There is much better drunk food There is much better sober food Chipotle is better than this Qdoba 
2NOspVF4dAa6ATXh1Zrh8g Urbana I have gotten so much of my furniture from here including some surprisingly nice antiques The selection rotates every week I ve had the best luck on Sundays They also have a TON of old kitchen gadgets and glassware upstairs I got all the glassware for my wedding from here and they were cheaper than it costs to rent from a service Second the complaint about the really loud religious music but it could be worse 
2nSiqOVmLzsxRJQvwPkoRQ Urbana If you re looking for cheap authentic Mexican food this is the place Yeah the place isn t the greatest looking place to eat but the food is fresh and flavorful I really like the different choices of meat on the menu besides just chicken and beef My friends and I ordered some chips and guacamole as starters and the guacamole was very fresh In addition the place is also a grocery store with meat spices avocado and etc The price isn t too bad at the grocery store at all The avocado seems fresher than the ones you would buy at the big chain grocery stores If you want a recommendation on something from the grocery store I would ask the owner who works there He s super nice and friendly 
2NsQve6UYvWAsLZqZ9S2vQ Urbana I stopped in to try the lunch slice special It was as it is advertised 2 slices of either pepperoni sausage or cheese and a bottled drink for an even 5 I chose a slice of pepperoni sausage I am very picky when it comes to sausage on a pizza and this sausage was very good too me The pizza didn t remind me of Garcia s The two crusts and flavors are very different I really don t like Garcia s sausage at all I always pick if off The pizza left my hands and face feeling very greasy and that totally grossed me out They have no napkins so make sure you are prepared for that I would like to note that someone in our office ordered the Hawaiian pizza for delivery and I tried a slice of it and I thought it was really tasty but then again the grease is what mainly gets me down I would like to try the thin crust so I might change the star rating if I think it improves 
2nvpDDJb1Zlwai4YARGkfA Urbana During weekdays I often stop by Rainbow Garden to pick up food as it has bargain lunch prices and is one of the few options on Neil Street that isn t fast food For around 5 to 6 you can buy a lunch combination meal that consists of a generous portion of your chosen entree rice soup and an eggroll My personal favorites are the chicken and green beans barbecue pork and snow peas and cashew shrimp Some dishes I ve tried in the past have been a little too salty and oily the Szechuan vegetables come to mind but I ve enjoyed most of the dishes I ve ordered Of the Chinese restaurants currently in the Champaign Urbana area I would consider Rainbow Garden to be the best option for a date The outside of the restaurant might seem somewhat unimpressive and grungy but the interior has a very sophisticated atmosphere with white tablecloths and dark red walls By American standards the wait staff might seem rude at times but their cold disposition is considered formal and polite in Chinese culture A previous review complained that the staff is unaccommodating and will not make adjustments to orders However I have previously asked the owners about special items and they have been attentive and considerate of my requests Rainbow Garden has also offered a special menu of delicacies during previous celebrations of Chinese New Year though from what I ve heard they might not be repeating this menu in the future still I think it s worthwhile to check on any potential Chinese New Year specialties 
2O9bSy91psHETv8ujexk8g Urbana Um Pokey Sticks are just cheese bread in pseudo pizza form They re okay I m not overwhelmed I m not delighted But they do what they re supposed to do I guess as a U of I grad student I m supposed to be enamored with the Pokeytasticness but as a former fan of Gumby yeah that s right 1980s cartoons were fun growing up and a fan of pizza I am required to say it s only okay That said the staff is really friendly But um not the greatest thing ever I guess my friends Pokey Prickle and Goo should all show up but that s probably the only thing that would make it at least remotely interesting 
2OMolFA7cWd9qs_pzIXkHQ Urbana Love the specials The Cuban is the best 
2plItngALXg8Y9NIPCZ1xA Urbana This place was awesome The service was great and very friendly We went for early dinner and had cheeseburger fries shakes and biscuits and gravy Everything was really tasty although diner y so you know it s probably not the best thing to eat every day Very well priced under 20 for all this good stuff and close to campus Highly recommend 
2prwLPcQvNvJ8ErRG5jC_w Urbana I went there with my friends who loved to try Korean foods We have tried bulgogi Brittos Budaejjigae bibimbap and dduckboggi Brittos is quite interesting Totally new tastes I heard that they have these korean style brittos and tacos in CA Probably these are from CA Budaejjigae is awsome Enough amonut and yammy spicy But too little Korean dishes I hope they can make Dolsot bibimbap soon which is my all time favorate korean food Above of all of that very clean restaurant especially restroom which is very important to me Clean and enough space for gathering friends and yammy food I will be back there soon 
2QpEnQiR14RpsDWeZY4zUw Urbana We have stayed here several times and for an extended period of time Parking does get tight at times especially if there is a function at the next door Garden Inn Clean comfortable rooms with a bigger sized fridge in the kitchenette area I never had issues with noise any time I have stayed here The manager Donna is wonderful The rest of the staff was polite and I don t know how they found out it was my birthday but I had a gift bag at the front desk waiting for me It could have been because we had stayed here several times The beds are super comfy and the pull out sofa isn t as bad as most I have encountered Not too far from UIUC so it s a good location for those visiting their kids There is a Jarling s Custard Cup pricey but very good IMO across the street a Walgreens coffee place Subway and Pizza place in the same complex The dinner is wonderful The breakfast area can get very busy in the morning You will find cereal oatmeal toast bagels a waffle iron to make your own waffles pastries and sometimes eggs or omlets bacon or sausage patties etc 
2r15uCVW7im7Amk_Yn7P_A Urbana Ate here Saturday evening 12 10 11 for dinner with my girlfriend Ordered the Cheese Curds as an appetizer my gf ordered the Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese and I had the Ribeye Steak sandwich We both had two drinks with our dinner Cheese curds came before the meal and they turned out to be pretty good Nothing to rave about but average At last our meal was delivered The bun for my Ribeye sandwich turned out to be what looked like Texas toast As I peeled back the bread to look at my sandwich I was in for a huge let down This was the absolute worst excuse for a ribeye steak sandwich My biggest complaint it was paper thin PAPER THIN Literately speaking my steak was no thicker than a cardboard coaster The price tag on this steak sandwich was 10 This is my biggest pet peeves when it comes to steak sandwiches I don t mind paying upwards of 15 for a steak sandwich but I expect good quality This was such a poor excuse for ribeye I had to eat it with the top piece of toast off just to taste the meat How dare they insult their customers with such a poor excuse for a steak sandwich My gf equally hated her grilled cheese for reasons she will explain in her own review Once the check arrived 52 we asked to speak with the manager We both expressed our concerns with Andy the manager We felt like after spending 50 we should leave the restaurant full and satisfied Instead we were leaving hungry miserable and downright insulted Andy rattled off various reason as to why my steak might have been a little on the thin side He apologized for the size of the steak and offered us 2 free drinks to make up for our poor experience REALLY We spent over 50 and all he was going to do was give us two free drinks No thanks We refused the free drinks and made sure he knew he just lost two customers for good I m not looking for a handout I m not looking for my money back but the way he handled our situation was horrible If a customer spends 50 in your restaurant and absolutely hated the food two drinks is not enough to make up for this I expected a credit or a gift card to come back and give Seven Saints another chance Now I will never be back I can find steak sandwiches comparable to the one I had at Seven Saints at Taffies or Steak n Shake Keep your two free drinks Just know we will spread the word to anyone who will listen I hope you handle future situations better 
2RyYX7jw24ChPxX-y5Y2KA Urbana I went for lunch here in December and was rather impressed by the food and service I recommended the place to my friends and we went there for dinner yesterday To my dismay the food was bad enough that I feel compelled to write this review My friend and I had the saffron risotto and it was horrible It wasn t creamy in fact it was soupy and bland The risotto itself was underwhelming with more green peas in it than actual rice grains The shrimp was overcooked and tough Worse I couldn t even taste a hint of saffron Needless to say we were not impressed Another friend had the mushroom and asparagus linguine with prosciutto The pasta was of an unappetizing soft texture and the dish was overly greasy The prosciutto tasted more like salted pork Their only redeeming feature was the crab cake appetizer I don t think I could recommend this place to anyone after what they served us for dinner yesterday Definitely not worth the price would have rather gone to Cafe Luna or Bacarro 
2S8_EB_uYhGUU7ywpsmXLg Urbana I m sorry everyone Maybe it s not fair that I review this as I love thin crust pizza so much Maybe it s also not fair that I was served after the pizza was delivered and then I waited in line for several minutes Maybe it was the ridiculous hype that everyone brought with it that was its downfall With those things in mind one of the worst pizzas ever I took a quick picture on my phone see http www yelp com biz_photos u8C8pRvaHXg3PgDrsUHJHQ select KEIMjrhuV466cpYyYI8nhw and sent it to a friend He wrote back calling it bread lasagna Maybe it wasn t very good because it had been sitting out for 5 or 10 minutes after being delivered It had almost no flavor though And it was ALL bread I ve had deep dish before that was much better I would be willing to try it again fresh at the restaurant if I didn t live 1000 miles away 
2SE8_qC3P2v-FvUO9Bxd-w Urbana It s all about customization here You can create one bowl of stir fry goodness or for 2 more an unlimited number of bowls After assembling various grains veggies and meat you have the option of putting other add ons into your meal represented by different colored sticks I ve always been a fan of the blue stick roti flatbread beware it is kinda greasy This Flat Top has a roomy interior but the L shaped buffet bar is cramped They always have exotic beverages here like desert pear pomegranate or chipotle pineapple lemonade margaritas and mojitos Refreshing and trendy 
2SudWi2937SYnbdS37HR8A Urbana I had 2 different beers they were both pretty good I ordered the mussels Over half were not open I sent them back Second time about 5 were not open not acceptable to me The broth was good however I also had the pepperoni pizza It was decent My bf got the cod it was very tasty Next time I will probably try an entree It was very busy when we went but we sat in the bar Service was good 
2t0WS5MyXJaPIg_obcO_gQ Urbana I must admit it is taking a little while for this place to grow on me but mainly because I like simple food without all of the frou frou fanfare But I thought it worth mentioning that I had a fantastic hangar steak and garlic mashed potatoes there recently Very simple just meat and potatoes It was great And the restaurants is very nice inside as well we like the bar area 
2tDhV9ifQBFnHQUeLkAeyw Urbana The Blind Pig is the best downtown bar for those in need of excellent atmosphere and great beer selection As a regular I love giving my 2nd favorite bar great reviews but it is not without some minor personal complaints As many have stated the beer selection is outstanding My personal favorites are the on tap Hefeweizen and the Robert the Bruce must tries for anyone even non beer snobs Most drinks will run you between 4 50 and 6 50 minus tip but they have on tap PBR for 1 75 if your feeling a little tight on the budget Similarly there is a good wine and whiskey selection and even some abnormal specials as they are trying to kill off the now defunct barfly s stock Also while they do not sell cigarettes the Esquire next door can supply your next nicotine fix As far as the set up they have traditional dart boards and a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating on the right night that is Listen I have been a regular for over a year but on weekends it can take me up to 10 min to get a beer and the bartenders know me More to this the clientele tends to change from pretentious hipsters to university upperclassmen depending on the day of the week so while this is the perfect place to hang out and talk with your friends if you come in looking your best on any night but Fri or Sat be prepared for some raised eyebrows read contempt from the hipster regulars If the names Sartre Chomsky and Dawkins mean nothing to you you may feel a bit outta place Similarly on weekends one spends a lot of time yelling over one s friends and the other patrons as well as fighting for a spot to sit down but that is part of the draw this bar is all about socializing I love this bar but not on weekends Regardless i suggest checking the bar out especially when they reveal their own micro brews next month Short story check out his bar The beer selection is worth it Trust me Edit The seating and wait situation only really applies during the school year Once the students leave these said issues are not as much of a problem even on weekends 
2tnNy0pBiN8wi55rZghw1g Urbana Ok everyone will talk about pho because it is like the hamburger of Vietnam So I m gonna rave about all the other stuff 1 Shai is hella awesome He really takes pride in his work and you can tell because when he asks how everything was he s really asking how everything was 2 Get the freaking Banh Mi Get the banh mi Get it Now I m going to assume from the domination of pho reviews that a lot of people in CU haven t been converted yet to this most awesome ambrosia of Asia It s basically a Vietnamese hoagie I cringe too as I type that the bastard child of the French occupation of Vietnam that grows up to be a beautiful exotic Helen of Troy A banh mi baguette is made with rice flour which gives a fragrant papery aroma versus the yeasty aroma of French baguettes a delicate crackly crust and a softly chewy interior It s filled with any combination of ingredients that reflect the Vietnamese talent for marrying flavors who else can make something taste hot cool spicy succulent crunchy and meaty at the same time Xinh Xinh s banh mi is effing great It s not the behemoth banh mi of SF which are the size of a Fat Sandwich sandwich but it s the perfect size for a meal I ll confess that when I go in I order five sandwiches Because this place brings out the glutton in me Shai changes up the menu as well so there are daily specials and new sandwiches to put into my five sandwich rotation For starters I d go with the B1 classic the beef with papaya salad different the chicken comforting or well you see how this gets out of hand Moving on before I drool more and short out my keyboard 3 The appetizers are also awesome Hands down the BEST spring rolls in town Yes beating out any of the Thai restaurants I m partial to the pork one that has some kind of wonderful crunchy stick I also tend to add both kinds of spring rolls on top of those five sandwiches 4 There is some really cool and unusual stuff on the menu for adventurous foodies There s nothing more thrilling than finding someone in CU who know s what s up and would rather go balls to the wall than play it safe I m talking about the egg soda Not an egg creme soda An egg soda Bubble tea is all well and good but EGG SODA This is the only restaurant that I will trek to Urbana to On the days when I roll out of bed too late to make it there they are open til ten pm Mon Sat I go hungry because I know anything else will be a disappointment I love this place If I could live there and eat their banh mi forever I d be a very happy girl 
2tuLPxDn2FH8szvVLZQhSg Urbana Pho tai and spring roll were pretty good 
2tva8WYjM47XMhcJB4PyPA Urbana I was going to Zorba s to have gyros until I explored this place and I m regretful about the time which I wasted in Zorba s Niro s Gyros on University Ave is a great place to have gyros Fast and delicious Also cheap You pay less than 8 for a value meal Also they have a deal when you get 2 gyro sandwiches you can get 1 free Only disadvantage of the place is that they have no indoor area because they work like a take away Anyhow this is the best gyros place in C U area 
2U5JgzZzGO1_TPqiAIK_3Q Urbana I had a very pleasant experience here The hostess who sat us was very friendly and helpful The decor of the restaurant is trendy but also inviting and it is a comfortable place to eat The food was delicious and I had a fun experience putting it together I was nervous mixing so many sauces and ingredients at first but it all turned out to taste amazing together I don t think you can really go wrong when making it The servers were very friendly also and I would definitely come back again 
2UlPYBI_4PhW98GeG6IHEQ Urbana The Garlic Pork is very good My family picks this as one of their favorite places to eat 
2uSTDMu7grS4g06Yf93bag Urbana I have been going to Debbie for a little over a year now and have never been let down The prices are reasonable for the area and service is great 
2UuPd_qoH2O0mW_G-dBezw Urbana DO NOT go here if you are looking for some chrome and glass ubermodern quail egg topped with scallion serving trying too hard to be trendy cafe DO go here if you are looking for decent Midwestern breakfast served in a cozy albeit kitschy venue for a decent price Woo for 1 Yummy biscuits that are an option instead of toast 2 Tasty sounding pancake options including the special that day pumpkin 3 A place that I can get an old fashioned chocolate soda Hellllooooo Boo for 1 A waitress who mistook my coffee order I got regular instead of the cinnamon almond which was the special 2 A waitress who slops coffee all over the table when setting down our mugs and then never cleans it up but clearly eyeballs the running liquid several times when passing by 3 Regular coffee that was so weak it looked like broth when I added a dollop of cream 4 Cold hash browns not that I had room to eat them anyway I was assured that the service is usually much better and more friendly I guess they were caught off guard with the rush of Dad s Weekend Menu options were enticing so I ll be back 
2VbfYqqxIQp0mk8G1ozU_A Urbana I have been here three times The first time my experience was awful What I ordered was uneatable and I sent it back and asked that it not be returned We ordered the fried mushrooms as an appetizer and loved them The second visit I decided to play it safe and ordered a simple sandwich It was bland and I didn t enjoy it very much Again we ordered the mushrooms and they were fantastic The third visit was so much better I ordered the fish taco lunch combo with chips and salsa and French onion soup The French onion soup was really good They didn t throw a bunch of croutons in it which is a plus in my book The fish taco was really good too I asked for extra chipolte sauce which made it that much better The chips and salsa were OK The chips were good but the salsa was on the bland side I also think it is somewhat pricey for lunch If you are looking for a better lunch deal then go to Friday s where they offer a lot more lunch combos at a much better price I will go back here again Especially with a group so we can order the mushrooms again They are so good Word of warning though they are big and I think you get 6 or 8 of them You will need help eating them 
2vLFhsiRTlYH0gtbAAVy_w Urbana I m a little too young to remember this place as R R s and I had stopped working here by the time they brought the shark bowl back but I was one of the first employees of this place when it reopened FINALLY as Firehaus in 05 This bar took a long time to get on its feet and by then I was tired of not making any money due to lack of clientle so I had moved on But now it s kicking ass and taking names and has a whole lot of loyal customers and for that I give this bar all sorts of props Also I just said props Ew Anyway the really excellent thing about this bar is that it is CLEAN Clean clean clean Even on Unofficial which is arguably the dirtiest day on campus all year the bathrooms at Firehaus will be clean The layout isn t my favorite as there aren t a whole lot of places to sit but the beer garden is excellent and the buffalo chicken sandwich with pasta salad was pretty damned good Of all the Cochrane bars on campus this one is without a doubt the best 
2VlWeAemTOxCUcehPRJhKQ Urbana First the good 301 Mongolia has a cool atmosphere great selection of ingredients for their bowls and excellent cocktails Now the bad The sauces just weren t very flavorful My husband had to go back to the buffet several times to get more sauce just to try and get some flavor The roti bread was only ok Finally we both got bits of food that were not in our bowl not cool If I want Asian grill I ll probably just go to Flat Top 
2vOfSkP0-ROueOKRT6Tolw Urbana Wow I will certainly be coming back And I will edit this review as fits I m new in town and hadn t heard of this place but my date had been here once before and enjoyed it We went on a Monday evening It s a small restaurant and I ve heard people complain about how it is decorated and kept but I really liked it It was clean and neat and small inside though it is in a strip of bars and other neon lighted windows If you think you re in the wrong place you might not be Once you get inside however it s decorated like your classic Thai restaurant We got the summer rolls as an appetizer and that was the beginning of the yum experience Very fresh veggies in a light wrapping dipped in a spiced peanut sauce I didn t think it could get any tastier until I got my dish a house curry with tofu I forget the exact name of it now I ll edit this later for it The first one on the curry menu though it s really worth trying I got a 3 5 4 spicy rating yes I did ask for the 5 thank you very much I like how they have this scale to be honest Anyways delicious Perfectly spiced not just in a hot way but in a everything is done right down to the last grain of spice perfect I don t even know how to describe it aside from that The tofu was cooked perfectly as well We washed it down with oolong tea from bags but this wasn t sad enough to keep this place from five stars If you know my ratings you know that means that this place was INCREDIBLE The service was also excellent we had two young ladies as our waitresses because one was training and the other teaching Unlike many trainees our waitress was very professional even though it was apparent that she was new The waitresses were very attentive and the service overall was very fast but did not give up any quality for the speed Anyways this place is a must try Oh yeah if you try and Google map this you get real Siam over in Thailand Just a warning Thanks Google 
2VqKNvzXvoiZ0OQNLugGuw Urbana I am not vegan or vegetarian but my friend is so I went with him and thought I would try it I had the BBQ seitan and for someone who doesn t eat that type of thing normally it was actually pretty good It had the look feel and taste of bbq pork I also had a side salad that had a yummy herb vingearatte I don t think I would go back again because I like my meat but it was definitely tasty and if you are looking for a vegetarian type of place definitely go check it out 
2vvB41Zwx03u0F44sgy_8w Urbana If you re too lazy to read my novel no judgment here is a summary Seven Saints awesome I m sure you ve seen a lot of 5 star reviews on Yelp and thought to yourself this person s 5 star is probably a 3 in my book so I think you need a little back story to understand just how hard it is to score the coveted 5 red stars in my book I m high maintenance I m also spoiled I m from California where there are actually more than six places to choose from for cocktails and late night dining It s not that I don t love quaint little Champaign Urbana but if a place doesn t live up to your expectations there are not many other options to choose from Ask any of my friends they heard me complain about this for months when I first moved here over three years ago Then I found Seven Saints This place excels in everything I look for customer service quality product and environment As you can see from the pictures the ambiance is warm intimate and inviting The seating and decor create an environment that is perfect for enjoying time with a date group of friends coworkers and even people you don t really like but are forced to hang out with once in a while Their menu has what I like to think of as fancy versions of classic Midwestern treats They are famous for their sliders try the Black Jack Slider come back here and thank me Or go for the hat trick and add on the Salmon Slider and California Turkey Slider and thank me three times The lovely waitresses waiters are always friendly and attentive It s amazing how they stay on top of tables orders when it gets busy As for drinks I m just starting to learn about beer and they have a wide selection to choose from Tuesdays they have beer specials which is a great time to sample things I wouldn t normally order And now for my favorite part Whiskey Wednesday I ve waited over two years to write this review because I treated Whiskey Wednesday like Fight Club it s so awesome you aren t supposed to talk about it The guilt has pushed me and I feel it is now time to let those of you who don t know in on this marvelous secret every Wednesday they feature 50 off their whiskey menu That s right This isn t a fake out Miko s 50 off either This is an unbelievable selection of quality whiskeys from around the world for half the price They rotate weeks from North American Irish Bourbon and Scotch in addition to weekly featured bottles I m not cool enough to call myself a whiskey connoisseur but I am very stuck up about my whiskey The two Whiskey Wednesday bartenders are amazing and are always able to find new and exciting things for me behind the bar They REALLY know their stuff Try it Go in and pick any whiskey off the menu They can tell you about the grain barrels aging process blend everything I can t even remember what I had for lunch yesterday They are extremely helpful and know the full range of whiskey flavors I ve been in many times with friends who don t drink whiskey often or are just starting out and want to go easy It doesn t matter how experienced you are the Whiskey Wednesday boys will take care of you Andy is the general manager and I can never say too many good things about him At most other restaurants you ll see the manager walking around to check things out but that s about it Andy introduces himself and actually talks to the customers He is always around to make sure people have a good experience It s a pleasure to listen to him tell you about the history behind a specific bottle or cocktail If you ve seen him on the CBS morning show you can tell how passionate he is about what he does So yes I just gushed about Seven Saints but I mean every word of it The quality products excellent customer service are enough to satisfy this high maintenance Californian I m also narcissistic enough to believe you ll actually come back on here to thank me Seriously Go check them out I ll see you again soon 
2WF9GuHilZU3I7pH6eVpSg Urbana Breads are all very good The espresso is terrible 
2xofgnLiwp-6xwbvv3vagQ Urbana This place survives because it is on campus and very conveniently located it is also the only restaurant within striking distance of the university that serves wine and has cloth napkins which means that it is full of administrators and professors The food is not at all good but it has no competition if you need to take adults out to a semi decent restaurant you can walk to from campus You should definitely avoid anything involving duck as a topping because it basically comes out looking and tasting exactly like pastrami from Schnuck s If you like that ignore what I wrote 
2xvzpV7vr2Q-Lzafr8hr6Q Urbana I ve only ordered through delivery here but so far my experience with this place has been excellent The woman who normally takes my order over the phone also tends to be the person to deliver the food to me She is a sweetheart and when I ordered from a different phone number than I normally do she recognized my address right away when I gave it to her and asked how I was doing What a great memory and way to connect with your customers Now for the food I ve only ordered a couple dishes from here but I feel no need to change my order any time soon Mongolian beef and the General Tso s is the usual First of all I love that they make no questions about making things spicy extra spicy The mongolian beef is ordinarily not spicy but when I asked if they could add some spice they enthusiastically said yes I haven t ordered it unspicy since The beef is sooo tender and the sauce they cook it in is to die for I literally would eat it everyday if I had a heart of steel The General Tso s is pretty good although not outstanding It s a little too sweet and saucy for my taste but I like to have something to contrast the beef so this is usually what I go for The only other dish I ve ordered is the Fried Diced Chicken w Red Pepper It s pretty much a party in your mouth Super spicy just how I like it the chicken is cut up small covered in batter and deep fried almost like popcorn chicken and salty which is awesome with a plain white rice The only reason I don t order this all the time is because it s a little too spicy that I don t want to always regret eating it the next day So I can t speak for a ton of dishes but the ones I ve had thus far have been very palatable And the delivery service is great Woohoo 
2xWRGXZCQ7TXE2OZA3d_mQ Urbana Great atmosphere and excellent deserts 
2y0ArxjBh-JpADw6cPV4pw Urbana I had the greatest experience at Esquire We went for lunch and had a waiter who was friendly talkative and helpful but not overbearing Our food was delicious came hot and was inexpensive The BEST thing was that we were talking about how we love Strongbow on draft and our waiter chimed in that he thought Bentley s had it and actually CALLED over there to make sure It was a wonderful experience 
2YERaYxp46o_EeIBXf7gsQ Urbana Love their juicy beef rice but not the cold noodle It s nice that they have free spicy bean sprout soup all the time Price is fair and service isn t bad 
2YnjFl6RgM0DlvWSbmys6w Urbana It s okay It s large lots of room But the tables are tiny They have free wifi but everyone connects to power strips and extension cords that are strewn about haphazardly Watch out so you don t trip And people would unplug your computer if you weren t paying attention It looks more like a dorm area than a business The tables and chairs are mismatched which I m sure is the style they re going for It would be cute if it just had something a little more to connect everything together instead of a bunch of furniture thrown in It looks like left overs from the dorms and frats that surround the area And it was sort of dirty Like dusty And the windows weren t clean And flies I can t stand trying to study with flies buzzing around me It s sort of the little things that can make a place be wow And the coffee was in my opinion rather overpriced Very good but I was a little miffed at paying over 2 for a 16 oz house coffee I guess because it s closer to the school they can over charge But my friend loves that brand of coffee so we go there I don t know the potential is totally there It would be better if they kept it cleaner and more organized and wiped the tables down on occassion But they do seem to have good hours open until 11pm I think And the people behind the counter were nice 
2yPyUGI90e3Mwb4-5xdUew Urbana Still good food like before the fire but the salads seem smaller The new modern style totally ruined the comfortable atmosphere 
2zmsElyBgX5MT7dWoxsQlA Urbana i will never set foot in a chain video rental store again it s the best deal in town on rentals especially if you invest in a block and they have a massive collection of international films and anime the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable too love love love them 
2ztAvHzboE76ggv0hBIkOw Urbana Very good food lots of interesting choices that are not available anywhere else in town A funky atmosphere and unusual ordering process but the service is fine for what it is Don t eat here if you want the typical sit down with a waiter dining experience and don t eat here if you are unwilling to take a little time to parse the menu They have English translations of it but come with Chinese friends and have more fun figuring it all out 
2zZPawm_aw5_jFFwHqOvcQ Urbana This is probably my favorite place to go to do 80 of my drinking in champaign It s chill and out of the way but interesting people show up The ownership knows what their doing as well as service is always quick to serve and quick to help How awesome is it to feel a good party mood yet ALSO be able to talk to someone 
2_rmaAa-x-ncSxDq7bMn3w Urbana Excellent pizza full disclosure I was a cook here and decent beer selection The pool tables make it difficult to socialize at time the bar space is too long and not wide enough However if you like pool these are very good tables 
3-hsH7e0xLT6om8aT5EkfQ Urbana I ve eaten here all throughout undergrad and stopped by again this past weekend while visiting campus My absolute favorite dish Indonesian Fried Rice did not disappoint think huge pieces of shrimp and chicken in a bed of delicious seasoned rice with a spicy kick and the perfect runny egg to top it off They have really good authentic Chinese dishes as well Mapo Tofu Crispy Tofu Pork and Bittermelon Three Cup Chicken The owner is incredibly nice and overall the service is very friendly If you are looking for a no fuss place and delish authentic Chinese food or their more American counterparts Cashew Chicken Orange Chicken etc for reasonable prices you ve come to the right place Cravings I love you 
30cfxSUC-qKouiNgwZuFuQ Urbana I ve eaten the brisket of Texas and the vinegared pork of North Carolina I ve savored the best meats in Memphis and met Kansas City s Arthur Bryant himself Li l Porgy s is the best barbeque I have ever had 
30w4hR6Iv2kczijAfPpsHg Urbana Even back home in the San Francisco Bay Area it s hard to find a lounge where good drinks small crowds great ambiance and plenty of good seating mesh The seating at Boltinis is comfortable and intimate Think black leather semi circle booths with high backs in the middle of the room Towards the back of the room are black leather rectangular IKEA couches with glass tables and candlelight everywhere The drinks are large mixed well strong and tasty Personally I prefer a perfect half dry half sweet vermouth gin martini shaken You CANNOT go wrong with the cheese plates here Make sure to come at least in a group of four so you can order the 3 cheese plate You choose from a cheese list and it is brought out with sliced baguettes toasted and non toasted fruit green apple slices grapes and olives I would highly recommend the gueyere euro cream and the cheese infused with port wine But seriously pick and choose to your hearts content because the pairing of great cheese with great drinks will make you feel reallll sexy I exposed my friends for the first time to Boltinis last weekend and they were highly impressed with the classy setting quick servers and amazing cheese and drinks Even on a hectic Saturday night we found a nice seating area in the back of the pit for all 8 of us Boltini Lounge is a place that should stay hidden thank God it s in dtown Champaign and not on campus for its adventurous sick of underage teenybopper gangsta wannabes discriminating clientele I tell my friends that Boltini Lounge is where the people sick of the same scene at Joe s Fubar or even SoMa turn to We will be there again tomorrow night for a birthday EDIT Only downside is that they don t serve wine So unfortunately you can t bring your own bottle of nice wine to enjoy here But I guess you re supposed to be here for the martinis right 
313DaHs1f-yHCMhD_RMqTQ Urbana Local institution though started in Danville where there is or at least used to be a location Lines can be long but service is pretty good Typical items shakes snowstorms like a blizzard some specialty items It s good but getting more expensive every year If ANYONE is in Quincy IL there is a place called Deter s that puts this to shame in quality of ingredients and price Too bad it s 200 miles away Luckily my parents still live there 
319tG93Pgs4_UG8tlc-pUA Urbana This was my favorite place to get Gyros in town Despite the heated debate over who had the best gyros Zorba s vs Niro s Gyros I always sided with Zorba s the fixins added to the gyro tomato onions and whatever else you wanted were always fresh and great quality something that NIro s seemed to lack on more than one occasion Zorba s had daily specials like Groovy Tuesdays one dollar off classic gyro meals which kept me coming back every Tuesday I attended classes at the University of Illinois However on Wednesday March 23 2011 Zorba s was affected by the fire that started in the apartments above the business As of now I don t know when if ever they ll re open their shop on Green St But here s to hoping 
32HO_usYTWH0FKmje4maVw Urbana I ordered 3 chinese dishes from this restaurant It was AWFUL The food had no flavor and the meat tasted horrible I ordered authentic Chinese dishes but it was awful I do not recommend at all I couldn t eat two of the dishes and the third one three cup chicken was decent but nothing to write home about 
33GaASlC7ALqpb2F23oIcg Urbana Solid cheap drunk food And when you re having a greasy day don t want to cook and want something different Their gyros are the only thing good 
34Ds_2o8diz_pWZpfp2NGA Urbana Unlimited soup and quality bulgogi bbq I m also a big fan of the bibimbap and uh the cold buckwheat noodles and pear I have no idea what it s called but it s delicious 
36BUCiTzUoCBdwmJp4WZsQ Urbana Is it just me or is the guy who works there an ass I don t know if he s trying to pull a Billy Goat s type of act but instead of being funny he just pisses me off Other than that though it s a good place to stop by after a night at the bars as it s right smack dab in the middle of Green Street and fulfills your alcohol induced craving for artery clogging grease I wouldn t stop by for food during the day as there are many more healthful choices around Champaign It appears that everyone else agrees since Big Mouth s is almost always completely empty during the day You get some good deals and the food isn t too bad but I still wish it hadn t replaced Sushi County 
36eIadOPNhw_tuRAySNVBg Urbana Look I don t live here and I know nothing about Antonio s Pizza I was interested in learning about their pizza and so I ordered some Thing is it never arrived About an hour after ordering we called We were assured it was running behind and the driver had left 40 min ago Well at this point we were looking forward to the prospect of 40 minute old pizza but not to worry it never showed up We tried calling several times afterwards and no one answered I sincerely hope everyone at Antonio s is well and that some tragic incident didn t interrupt our pizza but never before has pizza just not showed up At least the courtesy of a phone call you ask Nothing 
37kZLjdTb0NKYntA9XY5hg Urbana This review is on their breakfast only as I have never been there for anything else I have now had the pleasure of ordering all of the 5 burrito choices that must be made before 11 AM Some of my favorites include egg sausage jalapenos and a queso sauce The best things abou this place though is the great customer service When not busy I enjoy talking with one of the gentleman who are working When it is I normally read the student run campus newspaper The Daily Illini that they place on each of the tables or just enjoy the pandora station they have playing over the air For awhile when I was going more frequently one of the employees remembered my name They also have free wifi which is great For me one of the best grab and go or quick breakfast options on campus 
39M43t0qGJhH4D5f9UEURg Urbana Best Italian restaurant in Champaign Urbana Great food great atmosphere 
3aij1bgsE1AgA53IIE52dQ Urbana Arrived in Champaign late on Christmas Eve and the hotel had stopped serving food We hit the snow filled road to find some grub actually I was pining for a piece of pumpkin pie The Merry Ann s near our hotel was closed but we spied another one that was open 24 hours It was as if I d walked into a time warp the menu the decor and the pricing was unusual for this California gal I was thrilled to get a piece of pie and even happier for the 2 price There s nothing on a menu for 2 in California not even a sharing charge My partner had a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich with fries It may have been the processed American cheese slices but she was hungry I m glad I wasn t too hungry because the vegetarian options were quite limited and if I d stuck to my veganism I d be SOL 
3AmrQUGQ9B60Sourn5g10Q Urbana Pretty awesome Mediterranean food for Champaign I ve only been here once but my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it Our food came quickly and while we were waiting we watched what seemed to be a Middle Eastern version of MTV which was pretty entertaining We also didn t spend that much but walked out with a ton of food leftover enough for us to eat an entire lunch the next day The only downside of this place for me at least was the atmosphere and decorations I thought it was a little weird and disconnected but if you come in for a quick bite and just want some good food it s a nice spot to go 
3AtqdrOXEJWfDwFddGuemA Urbana I love this place Plenty of people have written about the food too many amazing dishes to list but I could live on the sweet potato fries and the ribs and the beer the selection is so good and it rotates and it s so cold and delicious But once you get spoiled enough by the food and you start to take it for granted because after all you know that it will be fantastic and you don t care if you have to wait and you don t even care if you have to sit at the weird little time out table in the very back you start to ask yourself the hard questions What exactly is it that makes this place so amazing What is the one ingredient that brings it all into harmony Well after twenty visits I ve figure it out It s that waiter You know the one The ironic hipster with the glasses and the longish hair who knows every single thing about all of the beer selections and all of the food and who is probably the guy responsible for the fact that Tom Waits is playing and you can just hear it under the really loud sound of the game on the tv at the bar This guy is free from the shackles of his hipster tribe because he s nice He s kind He will figure you out and he will use this knowledge responsibly This guy will tell you everything you need to know He will not patronize you rush you brush you off or forget your table He will shine his magical hipster doofus sparkle charm on you He is the patron saint of this restaurant Go there and ask him to tell you what to eat and what to drink Obey him Thank him Seriously who is this guy I love this guy 
3AzM1iJkdD5wg4s2j26usQ Urbana One of my favorite restaurants in town Not only their ribs are good but the sweet potato fries are awesome 
3b-FgrFl3PaTaodB4WxgSw Urbana Great Chinese I think it was a bit over hyped for me and so I was let down a bit but it s better than anything else I ve had in Chambana 
3bEK8B4XOdKgaR1a7s4hrg Urbana I had to restrain myself from writing this review right after eating here for dinner last night because I was afraid my distended tummy and satisfied tastebuds would ve influenced my review Well This place is great Very good tapas considering this is Urbana Champaign A tad expensive a 76 bill for three but that doesn t stop me from planning to make the rare excursion back Last night my sister mom and I headed down to V Picasso with reservations at 6 PM NO NEED FOR RESERVATIONS at that time my god there were like three tables filled It s a very pretty place all dark and sleek with lighted candles on each table There are two places to sit an actual dining area with plushy red booths and small tables and then a sports bar like area which unfortunately got filled with rowdy drunk college guys as the night went on Our server Audrey was incredibly helpful with the menu and her suggestions for the dates and churros were wonderfully enjoyed We ordered about 8 dishes including spinach croquettes the aforementioned bacon wrapped dates grilled zucchini blackened cod tempura shrimp the specialty for the night shrimp ceviche green string beans lavendar creme brulee and creme filled mini churros The Bad green beans tempura shrimp and shrimp ceviche The green beans were just blah with slivers of almonds A waste of 5 The tempura shrimp was redeemed only because of the delicious red pepper aioli that I swear I would take a bath in it was so good The shrimp ceviche oh the ceviche WHAT THE HECK A weird amalgam of tomatoes and olive and roasted red peppers and jalapenos blegh No Do not recommend The Oh So Good the dates ooh the dates and the spinach croquettes the COD The dates were stuffed with gorgonzola cheese and walnuts and then wrapped in crispy sweet bacon I don t like gorgonzola blue cheese at all but these I devoured these babies I dreamed about those dates last night Really The spinach croquette oozed with cheese and wilted spinach and they changed it a bit so instead of two greasy cakes out came out three crispy morsels Yum And finally blackened cod that was nestled on top of this tomato reduction that was slightly spicy Mmm I was never a fan of blackened fish but it was deliciously crusted in spices I need to go back and try the other tapas 
3cfDIpHMS9UGD4oWWhjFYQ Urbana It was meh the food was too salty and frankly the quality was just not worth the price BYOB is a nice feature which earned them 3 stars instead of 2 but I am guessing they are just waiting to get their liquor license until they start charging exorbitant amounts of money for drinks The price is a sticking point with me because this summer when they were transforming the creperie to this new place I kept hearing how they were going to serve real french food with local ingredients for a more reasonable cost compared to the creperie This has really not panned out I loved the creperie and I thought the food and service matched the prices they charged This place not only has meh food but the service was also not as good first evening chaos maybe I will give them a second chance but it will be with reservation and they will have to excel to make me change my opinion 
3CII2Sc82TCdp6YlXLqeFQ Urbana This used to be a decent Indian restaurant but the last time I went mid summer the food was so greasy it was practically swimming I hope it was a one time thing because I m not inclined to go back especially now that South Indian food is available in Champaign 
3csMOXAC_wj9y3nsFkvJfg Urbana This place seemed to be the fun college hang out bar The place where the frat boys come to hang out and scan the ladies up and down I am not a frat boy I did not come here to hit on ladies I felt old here Though the bartender was nice and offered some suggestions to my friend on where he could meet some ladies to hook up with Mercifully I got to go back to the hotel and get myself to bed 
3D7cpqT0DrpCRAVBq5sp3A Urbana I agree with many of the criticisms listed by other reviewers chips not great some dishes can be bland etc but Fiesta is still my favorite Mexican place in CU I am a vegetarian and I love that they have such a good variety of dishes available without meat I particularly love the chimichangas I also am not a fan of refried beans so I love that Fiesta has the option of black beans for all their dishes It is definitely a comfort food type of restaurant for me cheap and cozy and consistent 
3D9Fl75uDN_6qmvu1aDIwg Urbana It is only an OK place I heard about this place from my friend and went there on one afternoon I got Chocolate Croissant and cream puff The chocolate croissant could be less salty and a lot less oily The cream puff Jell O filling really I make much better ones than what they have I don t know whether I want to make a second trip there 
3Dm2IWtyiTimcfQSTfN2FQ Urbana They get one star because of the free stuff you can get there in the cold pack and the condoms and lube I had a constant supply of those yummy Cepacol throat drops and cough syrup And I think 12 condoms every 2 weeks is enough to get by right Well just barely The wait here usually takes forever don t think you can get in and out during the daytime when everyone s at class You can t Oh and when they call you in you re like Hooray But then you go into another waiting room Boo But I ve had a couple of okay experiences here I got my flu shot and meningitis shot virtually pain free and the nurses are pretty nice Ha but It s called McKillme for a reason My worst ever experience here was when I had an eye infection Turns out it was pink eye but at the time I had no idea what it was My eyes were so red they hurt in bright lights and watered constantly I didn t wear my contacts for days trying to get it to clear up but it never did so I grinned and beared it and went to McKillme The lady was she a doctor who knows there tells me I have an ULCER on my eye An ULCER on my EYE I F ing freaked out She sent me to an optometrist off campus I had to take a cab there I had to walk back to campus afterwards b c the cab never picked me up Once there the guy tells me it s just pink eye and he puts some ointment on my eye and gave me some eyedrops After that I never set foot in McKinley ever again Can you believe that she scared the sh t out of some poor college student I thought I was going to go blind After that I got my free sh t from the location that s in the back of the Union less of a wait and easier to get to 
3dP0CI2-i6zKvyRRyGzbbA Urbana Dealing with Ippatsu was a joy from start to finish I called the salon smack in the middle of their move from Neil Street to Chester Street learning of this from their voice mail message Early the very next morning Bob called and got me in with Doug later that morning Doug was wonderful He encouraged me to continue growing my hair out taught me how to work with my hair and ever so carefully clipped me The results are subtle just what I wanted I brought along a bag of the products I use He looked through them and told me I was on the right track to just be careful with products containing citric acid as it strips the hair Doug spent 1 1 2 hours with me I ve read the comments here and on other sites speaking of how hip the place is That s true but the salon felt very live and let live to me It s not about tattoos or lack thereof it s about being yourself and allowing others to be themselves From where I sat for 1 1 2 hours the folks at Ippatsu were wonderful and warm all the way around 
3Dvpmw8FRNu7mAtyShDgcA Urbana My girlfriend and I thought this place was pretty good Seeing that everyone was complaining about the prices and saying that it was overrated we came in with low expectations We only had sushi off the 1 menu and some how we ended up spending over 50 we ordered Nobilo wine and a few appetizers as well We enjoyed the sushi so much that we got a second order of sushi Being from California the prices of the sushi were really no surprise to us The place was pretty clean and the decor was very modern There was seating out side but my girlfriend and I still haven t acclimated to the humidity so we resorted to the indoor conditioning Overall a pretty cool trendy place to get a sushi fix if you need it 
3egiB6gLSIsGxZItUh1hVw Urbana This is just a review of the facility Healthgrades is probably way more helpful in determining if any given doctor is all that and bag of pills You can also Google them or even go to http www cccircuitclerk com and see if they are getting sued The Christie facility is well designed in a good location and well staffed You can park in the main lot or you can park in the Busey lots across University if you are sly about it MTD gets you there easily too You enter in through the main door and go to any of a bank of receptionists on your left in the back by the elevators Give em your last name and your co pay and they ll send you up to see the doc with your receipt For being just receptionists these folks are remarkably helpful and knowledgeable about various aspects of the confusing and never fun process of getting medical care They make it ahem as painless as possible You are not alone after typing that last one I hate myself too Anyway with receipt in hand head to the elevators and find your doc on one of the upper floors I have never waited long at Christie Clinic either in the waiting room or in the exam room but there are TVs tuned to depressing daytime programming in case you do Take care of biz w your doc and you re off If you were given a script the pharmacy next to the door is fast well stocked and seemingly pretty cheap 
3emFrAwczENSBwnBefRuUA Urbana I never thought I would describe an Optometrist s office as trendy or chic But there are no other words for Dr Kessler s office It s like a chichi hair salon The waiting room has techno music playing The magazines are of the Elle and Elle Decor variety instead of the usual Family Circles and US Weeklies littering the waiting area There is a long bar where the glassitas that s my new word amalgamating baristas and chicks who help you pick out glasses help you try on new glasses from an extensive selection It was odd but admittedly very cool BUT none of that compares to the fact that Dr Kessler is fairly frickin awesome He was obviously intelligent he likes Madison WI so there s apparently a light on upstairs ha ha I m hilarious but kidding Really he s smart He was very concerned about getting just the right fit for contact lenses and did a bit of trial and error there instead of just handing me a pair and rushing me out the door More than anything though he did not give me the usual patronizing explanations of where to look while shining a light in my eye I ve been doing that since I can remember and I appreciated being treated as such He also didn t push for me to have my eyes dilated that day All hail Kessler 
3EoXaS1Lo4PWmFaIaSPHRA Urbana As good as a cheap and greasy breakfast gets Very friendly staff and it really feels like a neighborhood restaurant The breakfast special with coffee is a fantastic deal and the refills keep coming Better food than Merry Ann s in some ways since it is the same type of food but Sam s is only open during the day I ll hopefully get a chance to go back for dinner Overall this is one of the best of breed for greasy delicious breakfast food at low low prices 
3eVGO_1FUhwaHaaGW5fHFQ Urbana Like many other reviewers I have suffered some bad experiences at Champaign Dental As a college student with limited funds I admit that I usually ignore my dental health at least when it comes to regular visits to the dentist Our student insurance luckily covers dental costs so I thought it would be a good time to get a check up especially because I hadn t seen a dentist in over 4 years During my initial visit I had a pleasant time with the hygienist who shared stories and was generally careful and attentive with my teeth However she called in the doctor to look at my teeth and they both confirmed that I required a deep cleaning I was a bit horrified and thought this was my punishment for evading the dentist for years as the doctor explained that my gums were now completely infected by bacteria that could ruin my jaw if I didn t have it treated They said the cost to repair the damage would be about 1 800 and they started pressing me when I looked apprehensive My dental insurance didn t cover such expenses I explained that I couldn t pay for the costs on my own but no problem for them Why They had a dedicated loan counselor on staff seem fishy to anyone else who whisked me out of the patient room and had me sign a loan for the procedure on the spot I know I should have been more assertive but I was very shaken about threats that my jaw would rot off within a year After a long and painful procedure in which the doctor injected pain killer in my mouth and then scraped the teeth under my gums I was told I would have to come back for regular follow ups each month to make sure the deep cleaning had worked When I came back for a follow up shortly afterward I was charged 100 again not covered by insurance The follow up took less than 10 minutes and consisted of the hygienist poking around my mouth which certainly didn t seem worthy of 100 I finally gave up on Champaign Dental at that point regretful that I didn t trust my initial gut instincts 
3FbD7gEsxtONMQXdHEl-7w Urbana I used to love T I S bookstore but lately I am so far from a fan I m now an off campus grad student and I ordered a textbook for class in plenty of time which they decided to not ship because they assumed I would want to pick it up umm hello check the adress So I got the book super late and was unable to be prepared for class which if you know me you know that that really bothers me I m sort of anal Also it took over 4 weeks to get the course packets all copied and sorted out super ugh 
3fVqJwreWFYzDz6r_zwEhw Urbana Service 5 stars food 2 stars atmosphere 2 stars Overall 2 5 stars 
3gD1EdYsfWnGq4aC5eVnQw Urbana Good burgers good beer Need more 
3GL6ComZwJR1pfNNtthNQQ Urbana After a disappointing visit to Murphy s on Wednesday evening for a burger I decided to try Legend s on my way out of town late Thursday afternoon I was not disappointed It s a bar bar food beer booths and stools The food is actually quite good This was probably my 3rd or 4th visit and it will now be my go to spot for a burger when I m in Champaign Did I say that the girls here were much much more attractive than over at Murphy s 
3GoqoHTJQIKY8M9aS4P_qg Urbana This is a truck parked at the corner of State and Bradley They usually set up on Fridays starting just before noon Things are little slow in the winter so they are irregular and you just have to see if they are set up I picked up 3 platters of ribs and tips a couple weeks ago for my family and we have been craving them ever since Tender juicy meat that falls off the bone nicely seasoned with sauce on the side The sauce is tomato based like something off the shelf but nothing I m familiar with probably customized a bit It s mild sweet sour tangy but not hot spicy I happen to like it a lot but I know others want more heat The ribs and tips platter is 8 and enough to serve 2 people or 1 very hungry person Comes with bread and chips These ribs are great and I can t stop thinking about getting more Just the smell is awesome In fact these guys have no signage the smell is what sells it I understand they also do catering You can find their number if you do some deep Googling but I ll leave it off here in case they don t want too many random calls 
3g_6d2xg3zQURggS0je37w Urbana Never bought anything from there but I love the look and the feel of the place The books they carry make me giggle and they have plenty of nick knacks and other things upstairs Whenever I am roaming on campus town I stop in and get an eye full 
3hgXz2oaUhxl0Bk7v41nGQ Urbana Pricey but amazing Everything I ve ever had there is top notch And when you re there for brunch you get bottomless MUFFINS And they re amazing muffins Try the pupusa if they still have it on the menu I think the menu changes a lot This place TROUNCES Radio Maria Trounces I can t believe more people don t go here I suppose it may be due to its location which is a bit lonely 
3iO2juf8Wlva2IDJElwMAw Urbana So Yelp pulled my First To Review review of this business and sent me an email explaining they did so because it lacks a substantive firsthand experience This disastrafuck of an excuse for what on a charitable day I would consider a missed abortion opportunity of a so called business would cause weaker souls to commit hara kiri before reaching the front of the line NEVER DO BUSINESS HERE NEVER Allow me to elaborate We spent 90 minutes here waiting to make a 4 minute transaction We rented a truck online and had our confirmation email and receipt with us There were 14 customers queued up when we arrived and only one gentlemen working the desk He had three computers going with a customer at each and was walking back and forth between them doing a little bit at each before moving on to the next Like reading the first three sentences of every article in the New York Times and returning to Page 1 to begin reading sentences 4 6 Not helpful Another gentlemen was working that evening but apparently did not know how to use the computers as he just stood by and watched the first guy inch closer and closer to a stress induced heart attack which may have proved more humane than the alternative Needless to say this business ranks among the most poorly run in town Good news for them is their survival seems secured by a lack of competition 
3IVxsS8mgqQyP99NhTP20Q Urbana Just discovered this place in the sport where Zyggyz used to be I ve only been there twice but I ve been impressed both times Being a vegan I ve ordered the Penang Curry w tofu twice and it has been ready in less than 10 minutes every time It is the best Penang curry you can get on Green St as far as I know the only thing missing is that it could use some more veggies like peas and carrots perhaps The spicy scale is between 1 6 and I like spicy food and a 5 works fine for me Big bottles of Sriracha are available if that s your thing For beverages they keep many pitchers of ice water ready for self service and as someone who likes to drink a lot of water with their meals this truly is a nice touch and I wish more places did this I hate having to wait to have someone refill my water and it s a lot easier to have a pitcher at your table if you are among a group or to just be able to stand up and refill your cup on your own As far a service I m going to second what most people have been saying very friendly service and always with a smile As stated previously the dish that I usually get comes out quick but the times I ve been there haven t been very busy Pricing is 8 10 dollars for an entree which might be a bit steep but the portions are adequate and not too filling Overall great Thai food and an excellent lunch option 
3IX2rHHZD0wDlZu6yencXQ Urbana I ve gotten takeout from this place twice now szechuan chicken dinner combo and I must say I have been impressed Not your typical greasy joint although it has the same menu as one the food was cooked to order with good quality chicken and veggies that still had a decent bit of crunch You can sub the egg roll for wonton soup for 85 cents so I did It was yummy and definitely hit the spot The only downside is that the dinner combos are just under 8 bucks which is a bit high but considering the quality I think this will move up in the it s late and I don t have any food at home rotation 
3j4OaMZypWylr7EuJ8IUNw Urbana Good food overall Offers a wide variety of dishes to pick from and all the vegetarian curries taste good I would rate it a zillion times better than the lame Basmati that it used to be earlier However i wouldnt recommend any dish that involves meat chicken lamb I auways end up finishing the whole dish leaving all the meat aside It feels like huge bland chunks of cisco meat that taste no better than rubber had been dumped into the gravy sauce curry that you ordered for and then served Now i stick to vegetarian food when ever i visit this place Note good cust service 
3jdQeXc6vUZBqTW__Wlvmg Urbana They have some really unique stuff in here I wish I new what some of it was but having limited foreign language skills makes it difficult to read some packaging Honestly I don t have anything to compare this place to and I don t shop there regularly but I like it for just being unique I give this place a solid three stars for carrying some really interesting items that I enjoyed They also had some beer that I had never seen anywhere else 
3JWwfZ2Wlz1Nw4qTFdxmiA Urbana I ll start with my negative feedback The service was very slow and the guacamole for appetizer was really bad They used way too much cumin I basically felt like I was eating straight cumin However the sangria is great although quite strong My favorite item was the main course I ordered the scallops and shrimp and thought it was wonderful Perfectly cooked and a lot of great flavors It s a little pricey but the main entree was worth it My husband had the pork tenderloin and thought it was great Skip the guacamole but get the scallops and shrimp dish 
3jxNzC9uH7ZBAUhyN0xZGQ Urbana It s like a portal into a chasm of anime classics world documentary and varied films and cartoons For Champaign these guys really have an outstanding collection of rare films What prevents me from giving it 5 starts is their stupid rule that you must have a special card and meet special requirements to rent a film from them including being over 18 for ANY film 
3k0HVp_ntwg6khsLQYquFQ Urbana This is a real gem Probably the most consistently good food in CU Lunch brings nice grilled or deli type sandwiches and there are veg options Dinner is much more interesting with pastas nice fish and meat entree specials and wonderful thin crust pizzas baked in hot ovens Desserts are also very good I am less into fondue exceot for chocolate dessert fondue but this is the place to go for that The ambiance is eclectic and European Families will feel welcome Service can be a little ragged sometimes a student group of 15 or large party will materialize and that can have a rather deleterious effect on service when there are only 2 servers on the floor which is often the case at night Even so I have never had a meal here that was less than very good and many that were excellent 
3KG9TwyGgkQfDytXZEg9AQ Urbana This place is an institution for me I have memories of picking out candy here as a tiny little thing and later tea as a teen and adult I like to stop in whenever I m in town just for old time s sake not really to purchase because I certainly can t justify their spendy price point now that I m a thrifty twenty something Now that I ve seen bigger and better it s hard to not compare WSTCo to some of the fantastic tea supply shops I ve found in the world Places with much better and more varied stock and more reasonable prices But this is Champaign specialty demands spendiness 
3l0yAmmF3V0aE2rIw_Vv9w Urbana I wouldn t really have bothered to give Suburban Express a well deserved one star review except that they ve apparently starting banning users who give them bad yelp reviews Feel free to add me to that list I d rather crawl to Chicago through shards of broken glass than ever have a conversation with the owner of this racket again And by conversation I mean the one where he yells at you for asking a perfectly reasonable question and then threatens to have you arrested for criminal trespass 
3L7_YrqUjNI9ZmzD_kV3Cw Urbana I stopped into Esquire Lounge for a couple hours in the evening while waiting for the 7 59 PM Amtrak train back to Chicago This place is right across the street from the station I sat by myself at the bar but there were plenty of others riding solo as well It was THAT kind of place where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows Actually it was much more than that this place seems to have a little bit of everything There are pool tables in the back so you can get that sort of crowd There are larger tables as well so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away There are a good amount of TV s so there were some people watching the evening college football games There are decent sized booths so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops And there s a jukebox so some people are silently rocking out to the classics And perhaps best of all there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem Although he didn t get the words right I gave him an A for effort The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends and even the students are cool with the townies The beer selection was surprisingly good There were a lot of good import options available although I stuck with 2 25 Bud Light drafts Remember I was taking the Amtrak home so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend They have 1 50 PBR drafts too which is what the locals stuck to The food was pretty good as well I had a simple cheeseburger and fries Although not my favorite burger fries combo it was definitely worth the 4 50 I paid The fixin s table they have is nothing more than onions pickles and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces Nothing special there But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself I guess The charm of this place lies in the characters that visit and for that alone I am giving a 5 star rating The cheap food and beer is an added bonus And I almost forgot free peanuts If I return to Champaign any time soon I will definitely be back to this place 
3Lh0k2s5MWemzhIEbXrDuQ Urbana Update 6 20 I thought I d give the impasta another try We had a guest from out of town and thought we d go out rather than spend the night in the kitchen As we went to our seats we noticed an overabundance of drinking and little eating As we scooted into our booth the ladies next to us had to bowls of pasta that for lack of a better description looked dead They were lifeless unappealing and bland So we sat looked over the menu talked about drinks and wine and sat Twenty minutes later we decide to get up even though several people had looked our way No bread no water no hello nothing As we left we were stopped However too little too late We won t be back 
3LlFgFPTqXEHyEQRl951ww Urbana This is a strange place but it has its pleasures It is a cafeteria with extremely plain mid Midwestern offerings My take It is what it is Sometimes I want Midwestern cafeteria comfort food If I do it is OK to come here But if I m honest I can t tell you that this is a good restaurant Hence the two star rating Five funny things about it 1 It s male It is always full of scientists and engineers from the Beckman and CSL Perhaps for that reason it is one of the few establishments that I have entered on a busy day and noticed that of the 20 patrons there are zero women 2 It s university run Since it is run by the university a sign says that you can pay by university purchase order if you want to I have never seen anyone do this 3 The secret garden You can eat in a garden that almost no one uses or knows about to find it you must leave via the West door It is dedicated to women in science 4 The regulars Some people show up at the counter and are served without ordering I asked a staff member about this and she said He s been wanting the mac and cheese for thirteen years 5 The almost free salad I stuff as much into the container as I can and yet after it is weighed I am charged something like 82 cents Dressing extra Although it is a very plain salad bar Most of the food is actually prepared at a food service warehouse somewhere else I asked when I saw tortilla crusted tilapia with long grain wild rice and Kyoto mixed vegetables and the lemon mist cake Once you see the place you ll have a hard time imagining them preparing the tilapia and baking the cake from scratch in the back room and it turns out they don t But both dishes are OK Some of the offerings don t bother Cream based soups are a disgusting glop Some of the naming conventions on the menu make me smile with white sauce Ground beef steak a hamburger patty Some things Heck yeah Jambalaya is good The pot roast is good The hamburger ground beef steak is good I agree with Sarah H the pecan cranberry chicken salad is the big winner Delicious And the staff are delightful They ll loan you money They ll change the dishes around for you They ll sneak you extra food and not charge you for it if you are even a little nice to them You can check the menu online before you go http www beckman illinois edu cafe Note that they run out of their main dishes almost every day usually after about 90 minutes In sum It s a strange little cafeteria But it may be worth visiting at least once just to hang around a weird cafeteria full of weird scientists 
3LRTJwUcNGM2nqq87nl6-w Urbana Luna has excellent food I ve always had a good time every time I ve been Dinner is tapas and various entree s it changes regularly I ve only gone when I expect to spend a good deal of money but I ve always found it delicious I prefer to go for the chef s choice special when I can Less decisions for me and a wide variety of good tapas I ve also been for lunch its less pricy but still delicious I didn t expect to be wowed but I would say their lunch hamburger is the best in town 
3LuvUIKeicodkMfrkRqnZA Urbana While living in Champaign this was one of my favorite places to go to Champaign is a great college town especially if you re in computer graphics but I had to drive to Chicago regularly for theater and museums collecting many speeding tickets along the way Yes after driving for 2 5 hours on the straightest freeway you can imagine a road with not a single tree a cop would give you a ticket for going 73 mph 
3LVfYeBtGdhCuV5hBXOXeg Urbana Siam is my favorite Thai restaurant in Urbana I love their vegetarian options even though I eat meat they make a mean mock duck and they are willing to substitute Seitan into just about any dish I discovered the CRISPY pad thai about a year ago and it s become my favorite dish pad thai that s fried what s not to love The very best part about this restaurant is the fact that they deliver to Urbana residents EAST of Vine st My only complaint about this place is the variable service esp since they don t take reservations I ve been here for both dinner and lunch on several occasions and I have to say depending on which server you get the service is either great or horrendous beware 
3MgkFpVLlSn5DOHAgc2qnA Urbana No thanks Normally I try to go to a place a couple times before writing a review but I don t want to go back I was feeling sick today a wintery day after the students have left for the semester and went looking for comfort food Spicy food seemed like it d be good for congestion and I hadn t tried Torticas Well Torticas was closed so I continued down Green Street to Burrito King I remembered how the reviews were kind of mixed here on Yelp either really high or really low and decided to check it out The good The server was quick and polite and I had horchata right away And a basket of chips which were the best part of the meal The prices are pretty much in line with a campus place maybe a bit cheaper than some The rest I tried to order a torta but I guess they didn t have any I ordered the fajita burrito instead because it s in the name and since I didn t see anything about cheese sauce in the description Comes out with cheese sauce Smells kinda strange almost like plastic The veggies just taste weird and are not crisp at all The meat is chewy and also has that weird taste that reminds me of plastic or chemicals Cheese sauce is really no good salty but not much else in terms of flavor I ate about a third of it trying to make sure I didn t just get a bad bite or something but it tasted strange and unappealing Other than the weird flavor it was pretty bland and no hot sauce on the table at all which is weird for a Mexican restaurant I like Taco Bell sometimes so the food smelling like chemicals isn t always even a deal breaker However I also like Mas Amigos and Taco Loco for their cilantro and onion tacos and spicy flavors and would definitely recommend them or even Taco Bell over Burrito King If you like food like Mas Amigos and do not want the most midwesternized Mexican I ve had then don t go here 
3myJiX_T_C3-1U5YuOHKSQ Urbana Best Authentic Mexican in town hands down I was told this by an authentic Mexican Great Tortas and good drink specials IT is small and pretty popular so be careful peak times 
3MYYdpnjSqKrpF8q875kZA Urbana I went to Chester Street Bar on a Monday evening on finals week needless to say that the place was rather empty In fact there were only two other patrons and the bartender in the bar which by the way is huge Then the two other guys left leaving me by myself until a creepy guy showed and of course decided to strike a conversation with me But really it was fine the bartender was very friendly and the drinks are pretty cheap They also have free popcorn I ll have to check it out again on a busier night

3NoR6YI8B5ULfOAsS41F2A Urbana Holy sugar high Batman This place is a great place to stop for a dessert after lunch or dinner in Downtown Champaign and now that the weather is warming up should be a great place to hang out on the patio I had the vanilla cupcake with the most amazing icing EVER The cake itself was pretty dry I like a more dense moist cake and cupcake but the icing had me making inappropriate noises in the middle of the afternoon The decor is definitely Ikea chic and the seating is not designed for comfortable conversation but the DT Champaign hipsters in there on their laptops didn t seem to mind The other major negative was 2 for a glass of milk Talk about profit margin I can get a GALLON of milk at Aldi for 1 99 and I m guessing the owners of Cakes do too Overall though not a bad place and I ll definitely swing by for a grab and go during my next stop in Chambana 
3nRP1wjHmJHLf7on9fnNhQ Urbana Had two slices on a Saturday night one sausage and one loaded total was 4 37 with tax Greasy but good taste and crunchy thick crust Good value but not the greatest pizza I ve ever eaten 
3O8Rvulpx-HJlBUaeQCkrw Urbana The restaurant definately looks elegant and is impressive It is clear why it was voted best date place in champaign The menu is interesting expensive and not kid friendly though that appears intentional since they want big checks not big families Veggie option on the menue I had was tofu veggie stirbfry but when it came it had zero tofu strange given the dish was called tofu vegetable stirfry The waiter never checked in on us after our food arrived until we were finished He showed me an updated menu in which there was no tofu in the stir fry too bad I had an old menu he didn t appologize just said that he will make sure to remove the old menus from the stack thanks My daughter liked the dumplings and california roll the edamame are served with sesame oil which is a nice touch The waiter refilled my daughter s lemonade with ice water thanks for that too My son objected when he tried to fill his sprite with water My son and wife liked the steak Dessert was good according to my kids though they didn t finish it so it couldn t have been that good I ve not seen them fail to finish chocolate cake before In all it s over priced decent food with not so great service but excellent ambiance Great for impressing your date but not necessarily great food or service 
3OPH1y8FyocdbG1ZtzTKbA Urbana This is a nice little place Nice staff cool decor I ordered the goat cheese salad spring greens grapes strawberries goat cheese sweet roasted walnuts and fruity vinaigrette and a salmon slider The food was decent Loved the salad but might not get the salmon again as the flavors just didn t work for me However they do substitute boca patties on any of the other sliders for 0 50 extra so I might try that next time What I really like about this place is the strong drinks Two drinks and I had a nice buzz and I m normally not a two drink lady The signature cocktails listed on their menu are pricey but I ordered a Tom Collins not on the menu and it was 3 50 which is pretty good in my book 
3orCMRgjedjpAx7kyo4Bag Urbana I ve been using G Mart as my comic supplier since 1999 or so which is somewhat remarkable because I haven t lived in Illinois since 2007 The storefront itself is an excellent comic store and I have long enjoyed stopping in to chat with the staff but its pre order system is even more remarkable Yes you have to pre pay but you get 35 off for your troubles and when you ve been doing it for this long it just feels like you re keeping the pump primed And given that they offer free shipping on sufficiently large orders I have pretty much no reason to change comic stores any time soon I recommend G Mart to both Champaign residents and to anybody that s looking for a simple way to mail order comics 
3OTMMDTJBfecpM0eV5caPA Urbana This restaurant is WAY OVERPRICED The very small seating area is tacky old and dirty The food is so so at best and the prices are double what they should be Much better choices are available in Champaign try them first 
3oWYsnnbIvlskcDBOM4_8w Urbana My favorite sandwiches for lunch great Mediterranean and grilled cheese tomato sandwiches 
3o_IB66OTBv4FB_EbkDLHw Urbana For the last three years that I ve lived in Chambana the storefront on the corner of Neil and University has puzzled me What was it Why is it in a perpetual state of construction Is anything going to open there Well finally it s open Quality is a new bar run by two brothers from Watseka IL In a strange coincidence I happened to be good friends with a brother of the two owners back in San Diego and he told me that the place was opening so I headed to their soft opening last night In short this place has amazing potential It s got a great lay out first off two separate rooms with large space and funky vibe one room boasts everything from a vintage Ms PacMan table arcade game to a haphazard book collection to a chalk wall and bench overlooking Neil Street the other room showcases the expansive bar which is host to an AMAZING selection of great beers on tap You have beers like Founders available next to great California beers like Stone and Lagunitas it makes me both homesick and delighted to see what they ve got on tap I d really heartily recommend going I think this place is going to be the next spot to watch in town 
3pGNlHLVGtZeOzq9NteeLQ Urbana Xinh Xinh is where I go whenever I m missing the amenities and diverse cuisine of home L A Shai who also hails from L A does a great job in bringing some good cheap Vietnamese food to a town that has a limited selection of tasty and fairly authentic ethnic foods beyond the few Chinese gems I ve found Though its definitely not quite like going to Little Saigon in Santa Ana Xinh Xinh offers some really tasty food Their pho is really good though definitely smaller than the ones I ve had at home and their Vermicelli bowls are also super tasty I m especially fond of the egg rolls that go into the Vermicelli bowls which are really different from the ones I ve had at home I ve also had some of their rice dishes which are excellent One of my favorite things though on their menu is their Nataing or ground pork in coconut milk It is really different and sooo yummy with the chips that they use which crackle when you put the Nataing over them The service is always great and Shai the owner is super friendly and accommodating I always go early on Wednesdays because it s a hole in the wall place and gets busy for Happy Hour Pho but even without the Wednesday discount the food is always still well worth its price 
3QNyP6SJsgAPCp45ofyv7w Urbana When I came here I knew it would be hard to go to any other bar on campus again Their beer selection is impressive to say the least The range and caliber of the drink selection is great I came here on a number of happy hours to meet with colleagues and friends and it has always been a pleasant experience One criticism for myself or the owners is that it is sometimes annoying that there are two Blind Pigs the original and the brewery one on walnut and the other on Neil because oftentimes we get confused which one we are going to If you are looking to get some food I am afraid you are out of luck because they only have drinks On many occasions I went to the sandwich bread shop to get appetizers and or a meal and there were no objections I call it BYOF Definitely the best place to go for a drink for those who love and appreciate good brews 
3QRTVkh9dUhkZAbGT6YESg Urbana Illini Inn is the last dive bar remaining in campus After Deluxe got knocked down to make way for the mediocrity of Legend s and Murphy s expanded and cleaned the place up Illini Inn stands alone This place is a true dive cheap drafts dingy bathrooms a good jukebox and a surprising lack of fratboys especially considering you re surrounded by big houses with greek letters in the front yards Go forth Chug a beer Join the Mug Club 
3qvhnDGt85JxVftM_IktcA Urbana Everyone likes Dos except for me it seems which is a shame since it s cheap near campus and the service is good What can I say The meat quality reminds me of The Jungle the spicy sauces are incredibly bland and everything seems to be soaked in puce colored refried beans The hilarious thing is how every item on the menu is pretty much the same there is very little difference between the tacos the burritos the tamales or anything else Entrees are a lot better than the specials The carne asada tacos while very much not carne asada are OK The ambiance can be summed up with a description of the walls pink and orange sponge paint Dos Reales has a lot of loyal fans but I prefer El Charro or Los Amigos 
3r7VGfVMEO2AJ5kR_c7AbA Urbana Dos Reales is a good place for decent Mexican food The prices are in line with what you d expect They have a wide variety and they are walkable from campus I go regularly for lunch and always get the fajitas or fajita salad There s always plenty of leftovers to take home 
3rNdu0WapguOqXIkwpm4TA Urbana Brent Racobs is a bike geek He buys restores sells and services bikes out of a blue ramshackle house on Main Street There is no sign You will know the house when you see it just look for about 250 bikes outside in various stages of undress and Brent probably farting around outside or just inside the front door in bare feet and covered in axle grease He carries all sorts of bikes but his absolute favorite bikes to work on and the specialty for he is known for around town are English made bikes that feature Sturmey Archer 3 speed internal shifters These bikes were built extremely well and last forever He will tell you all about them whether you want to hear it or not If you have one he wants to buy it If you want one he has a dozen or two at any given time for between 125 and 350 or more He tries to match the bikes with original pieces repairs what is broken gives them new tires etc repaints them usually more than 1 color and gets great results I purchased a bike from Brent that is older than I am and looks great Its fast as hell has a comfortable smooth ride and looks great I feel like a right proper English gentleman toodling along to work at the scrivener s shoppe He basically does all maintenance on all bikes that he sells He will explain to you that he will warrant the powertrain of the bike forever but if he keeps talking he will tell you that you are always welcome to bring your bike in for a fixin or a lube for free or real cheap if new parts are involved He insists on this actually He cares so much for these English three speeds that he wants to make sure the maintenance is done right I really think he cares more about the long term care of the bikes he sells than customer satisfaction but your byproduct is great maintenance service he will even pick you up in his truck if you are stranded somewhere so who s complaining A word of warning he doesn t like to think of what he sells as cheap bikes so if you don t want to hear about why the bikes that he spends hours and hours restoring are not cheap just ask what he has in a particular price range Also be aware that the first floor of that blue house is absolutely atrocious It is not a pretty sparkly showroom but it is filled to the windows with all manner of partially assembled cruisers road bikes and curiosities from the past 70 years or so I highly suggest calling ahead to make sure he is available before stopping by as this is a one man operation Do not plan on getting in and out of there really fast as he will want to get to know you to help you pick the right bike and once you decide to buy the purchasing process takes more than a while He is anal about keeping track of who buys his bikes so if you buy a bike from him he s gonna take your picture and email it to you record the serial number etc 
3RTFHgiOvkA1OQeoXmmCQA Urbana I think the other reviews are unfair This place does not pretend to be a high end eatery The food is for college kids who working through a hangover or need to load up for an all nighter That said this place does the job I stopped there after a long car ride from BMI airport I was starving so everything tasted good though also had to remove a good amount of the fries to eat the sandwich like another reviewer It did take a really long time to get the sandwich even though the place only had 1 or 2 other customers I had no problem with the bathrooms but I imagine they are in worse shape on the weekends after everyone s been out to the bar They have rolls of paper towels at the tables instead of typical paper napkins I did have to use a lot of them after unwrapping my sandwich Basically a 2 star type of restaurant sandwich shop fast food but it does a 4 star job of it Good but the food could use a little more engineering to taste better vs just paying for a lot of calories 
3RxOnXZSQc7QVrm9RPcRQA Urbana University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign is known for having one of the biggest university library systems in the world Grainger Engineering Library is UIUC s cornerstone library Grainger is filled with thousands of science and engineering volumes which are available to all UIUC students The library is open 24 hours a day 7 days a week and library staff are always available to help locate books Grainger is populated with students primarily engineers at all hours of the day The library provides a quiet comfortable place to study When final exams are approaching there isn t an empty chair to be found in the whole library 
3sfVp0AhVZCFjOixjIL52w Urbana I have to update my review for this The last few times I went to Paradiso I ordered my usual cappuccino It was bad to the point where I could probably do better making it at home the foam wasn t smooth or well integrated with the rest of the drink It was pretty much plopped on top and had the consistency of dish bubbles which is not what you want when you re making a cappuccino I d probably give Paradiso a 2 5 if I could because the sandwich i got there was pretty good But I was just so so disappointed by the cappuccino quality that I can t give it a 3 
3smC78GOGkC6QLCjiLyEMQ Urbana This restaurant was good fine but I wasn t particularly impressed Ordered vegetable vindaloo The place lacks any ambiance though it does have a nice view of Green Street The naan is very good 
3t6fzN7pSSRI4OP3fxhByg Urbana Whoever wrote the laughable policies page for this missed abortion opportunity of a so called business sounds like a used condom of the highest order Exhibit A the Cell Phone policy Cellular Phone Usage In the interest of the sanity of those around you cellular phone usage is limited to 3 minutes per passenger per trip If you feel compelled to blather on about your relationships what you did for the weekend etc please move to the restroom to do so Nobody finds your life as fascinating as you do Cellular phones are strictly prohibited in the Suburban Express ticket office Passengers who violate any portion of this policy waive any perceived right to civilized treatment by everyone within earshot Suburban s website speaks for itself And no this isn t some cutesy Ed Debevick s kind of kidding around playful bullshit They re serious Suburban Express is in a years long feud with Lex fueled by the owner s mental illness I can tell you from experience you re gonna be late You re gonna be angry And you re gonna wish you had taken the train for 14 Take your business elsewhere 
3TUvnshTo3jRR-OBTu0Usg Urbana I ll admit that food wise Merry Ann s certainly isn t worthy of four stars but for me it s more about nostalgia We always used to go to the one on Kirby and Neil back during my U of I days but now when my husband and I go to C U we ll occasionally go here for breakfast Their breakfast fare is actually pretty decent and insanely cheap Everything else is pretty much meh Typical diner fare Milkshakes are super yummy though There can often be a wait on the weekends particularly during home football game weekends but it s never very long at all and I suspect there s probably a wait at most other places too There s a parking lot adjacent to the building which is convenient and there s easy access to 74 
3u-_7OCB6AcVTf1qXqkEXA Urbana I agree that being in the puke filled street isn t a plus but it IS still right across from the psych building which I enjoyed Some of their hot sandwiches are very craveable the roast beef au jus one and anything with barbeque sauce always appeals to me and it s a nice change of pace from Subway and sooo much better than Jimmy John s
