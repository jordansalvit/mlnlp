--zIkq5bERlrhFBgXOQwaA CMU Black Bean is one of those restaurants where you can eat if you re in the mood to really really splurge on calories At least I have to assume this because the food we got though delicious was supremely greasy which clearly added to the deliciousness despite what my arteries may have thought This place strikes me as a primarily take out restaurant as we were there in the evening and saw many people stop in to pick up food but only one or two other people actually sit down for dinner That said they do have a reasonably sized seating area and what appears to be a full bar so eat in is definitely an option You place your order at the counter and then it is brought to you at your table We wanted to sample a few different things so we got the croquetas and papa rellenas appetizers to start Both were really amazing croquetas are the equivalent of cheese sticks with ham inside instead of cheese The papa rellena was a ball of fried mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef Do you understand how as my tastebuds cried out in joy my arteries cowered in a corner Since these were such heavy appetizers we split dinner deciding finally on the fried chicken platter It s a light fry very well seasoned and tasty and not dripping in grease the way a KFC fry does However your plate comes stacked with rice beans or black bean soup which we tried and tostones which are twice fried green plantains Again delicious but heavy Service was good and the churro dessert despite taking a little while to get to our table was decent Four churros for 2 95 The prices were really reasonable here as well and everything is available for takeout Apparently this is a small franchise with all of their other locations in Florida so don t be like me and get your hopes up of seeing flan on the menu as that s only in the Florida locations All in all it s worth a stop in There very well may be healthier options on the menu but we were quite pleased with our unhealthy but tasty choices just the same 
-0JWaJMwpc2odCUjObVdcg CMU Love their gluten free pizza This place is a godsend for those of us with gluten issues Crust comes from the Gluutenay bakery so you know it s right They are careful to use a separate cutter for the gf pizza Thank you thank you thank you 
-0PQ7sPlGn0x6_s2R-oSyw CMU I love Jimmy Johns It came to a point where I had Jimmy Johns every night for 2 weeks The vito is awesome and I love their totally tuna The bread is what makes the sandwich though and oh man it is awesome Jimmy Johns probably has the best sandwich bread that I have ever tasted and I know my sandwiches 
-32Xo_dYoDTqc_Ev2C_adA CMU I ve had pizza from Say Cheese quite a few times and was always floored by how tasty it was Believe me I ve had a fairly extensive sampling of different pizzas from all over Pittsburgh as a college student at CMU and Say Cheese was hands down the best pizza I had in my four years there if not in my whole life but then again I ve never had pizza in NYC or Chicago so EXCUSE MOI if you happen to be a pizza snob Every part of their pizzas taste fresh and delicious and I especially love the crust of their traditional pizzas thick and doughy They have pan and Sicilian pizzas calzones and lots of other offerings on their menu too Their prices are also very budget friendly and they have free delivery And I just looked at their website and it looks like they now accept PlaidCash CMU dining bucks WHAT I wish I were back in college Okay not really But I d definitely stop by Say Cheese if I m ever in da Burgh again Nom nom 
-3tsL4h8eFkDLjufcJBB7A CMU I tend to be very particular about Indian restaurants as I can normally get really good Indian food from my grandma s kitchen So as this was going to be my first Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh obviously I was going to be a bit reluctant of giving praise Some coworkers and I decided to grab some dinner here a couple of month ago First of all you should know that its going to be difficult to find street parking around this restaurant Be prepared to look around and just drop off some people from your group so that everyone isn t deprived of a drink before dinner Once inside the place was small but not congested with a small bar area towards the front They played hit music from India as well Indian music videos across the vast array of flat screens plastered on all the walls Nothing fancy really just the flat screens made up the decor of this place My colleagues had all been here before so they all knew exactly what they wanted so I decided to go with the a staple at Indian restaurants butter chicken I asked for it spicy just to see if they could actually make it tasty as well as spicy without just adding extra crushed red pepper Also one of my friends loves to burn his tongue and digestive tract so he asked the waiter to give him a 15 out of 10 on the spice scale I threw a blank look at the waiter and he said okay The food came out quickly which was a good first sign Next came out the Naan At any indian restaurant you can easily tell the quality of the food by the naan Overcooked and burnt you probably should not come back Anyways their Naan was both well cooked and soft which was great Finally the food came out and the aromas were amazing and it was delicious I thoroughly enjoyed my dish which was flavorful saucy and spicy and the Naan only helped to bring out the well balanced dish Well this place definitely deserved 4 stars because it delivered the spice level that my friend was looking for as he was sweating during the dinner 
-4O_tHmRmFfFs_aFalRBpw CMU Not great Stale bread and the food was strongly over flavored I had a glass of wine and was asked if I wanted another and I said just a half glass which I ask for all the time and get The reply from the waitress was we can t do that and the same from the manager CAN T do that Terrible attitude more like WON T do that Well I WON T be going back 
-5F82kXM9cuq9AFvYrZM-A CMU Great great service and fast Sat down and in less than 5 minutes later the food came out Don t even care if someone in the back heated it up in a microwave for the price you pay it s worth it The food is pretty good and the portion sizes will last you for a few meals The food takes me home but a greaser version of home 
-5YweTc2f63alMWaHn-qOA CMU Pittsburgh is a funny city There are fantastic high end restaurants e g Tamari Spoon 9 on 9 11 etc but not so many medium to low end restaurants Well La Feria is the clear exception For 15 or less you can have an amazing Peruvian meal My wife and I are experimenting with vegetarianism I know we re missing out on a lot of yummy meals and La Feria is particularly great for us They always have 2 veggie specials that are great Last night I had this bean and pumpkin dish which was fantastic The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the staff are friendly so for a quick and tasty dinner this is the place to go 
-6DLz1IRdz5zpNRuC9DMNQ CMU I visited the 1947 Tavern on a Saturday night with five others We luckily had a reservation as the small space was pretty packed at 6 30 Our server gave us a run down of the specials and we proceeded to order drinks There were no bourbon drinkers at the table but my lady got a whiskey sour and later a shady cider both of which she enjoyed The first course of the table consisted of bruchette cheese plate mac n cheese and a cup of the soup du jour beef vegetable The bruchette had duck confit on it great flavor but the crostinis were a little soggy The peanut sauce was well liked by the table but the fruit jam was out of place and bland on the cheese plate I quite enjoyed the aged goat cheese as well as the pate The mac n cheese was just pretty eh It was served in a casserole dish covered by a parm crisp It lacked flavor and moisture and although i ate the entire cheese crisp it seemed odd I m not sure if it was intended to be eaten with the macaroni since it pulled off as one large chewy crispy sheet of baked cheese I was told the cup of beef vegetable was very good The entrees consisted of lamb burgers the fish special lamb pasta chicken and I got the lamb loins Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees and left full We all cleared our plates with the exception of the lamb pasta which was definitely the largest portion at the table Some notes on the main course My lady was not a fan of the buns used on the lamb burger The dish itself is two slider sized burgers on what looks like large dinner rolls The buns texture though reminded me of stale biscuit The fries and demi sauce were both tasty though as well as burger patties that came out as requested medium My lamb on the other hand came out about a doneness too far luckily I ordered it MR so they were still good The meat was about four chops worth of meat served off the bone The dish looked a little messy and lackluster because of this but I enjoyed the lamb roasted tomatoes polenta and sauce on my plate My sister got a MW steak which was cooked perfectly She really enjoyed it but said her scalloped potatoes weren t very warm and had an odd flavor After tasting them I believe they used a goat cheese in the potatoes for a bit of tang The steal of the night was the fish special which was a pan seared Hawaiian Escolar for 15 It looked good and the plate was cleaned pretty quickly In conclusion I should mention the staff did well Our server was a young lady that offered to answer any questions and checked on our meals promptly after they were served She refilled waters fast even though the restaurant leaves a carafe of water on the table for the guests She also brought out a plate of toasted crostini when asked for something to pick at our peanut sauce with while waiting for the main course which wasn t a long wait Sadly the tavern does not offer bread service All said and done it was pretty ok With myself not living in the city I can t say I will make my way back here anytime soon but I wouldn t be opposed to trying more of the menu sometime 
-77Mt73ipevSGb1u3CdFHw CMU When my friends wanted to meet up at 1947 I groaned because my experience there last winter was NOT good see original review However when my PIC Partner In Cuisine and I arrived last night we were pleasantly surprised to see that 1947 had a pretty nice back deck for warm summer outdoor seating Ok I thought Maybe at least we ll have some nice atmosphere When I picked up the menu I realized it was completely different The options were actually pretty decent looking and the prices were WAY better than I remembered especially the beer prices I ordered the fried chicken salad and I got a deliciously fried chicken breast on a bed of greens with a 1 2 of avocado It was pretty darn good The downside this time was the service The restaurant wasn t really that full certainly not at capacity yet it took almost 10 minutes to get a beer from one of the hipster wannabe waiters Sometimes it s good that even if you have a negative experience at a restaurant to go back and give it another go after a while I m glad the management made the menu and price improvements because my second experience there was leaps and bounds above my first They will definitely be given more opportunities to earn more stars from me if they keep it up Original Review Not a fan Our party spent more time and money at the this place than we should have The service was good but otherwise the food tasted like something my elderly grandma with no sense of tasted put together and the drinks were way way way too expensive With all the quality places to spend a Saturday night in Shadyside 1947 doesn t even rank 
-7jue7YOkdpxowJBHlaPcg CMU I took my family to Pizzutti s a few months ago for my mother s birthday I d never been there before but I knew the location was nice and we re all fans of good Italian food The reservation I had made was never put into the book even though I spoke to one of the owners on the phone and made the reservation The bread must have just been defrosted because it was still cold in the middle We waited at least 20 minutes for our food to come out from the kitchen They brought out the wrong dish for my dad which he promptly sent back When they brought out the correct dish we complained at which point the waiter finally offered to at least give my dad his meal free of charge All the staff we interacted with were less than apologetic about all the problems we had that evening Needless to say I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone 
-8ETP1iX_UbafqFtEtm3MQ CMU Thai Place says they re one of the 10 best Thai Restaurants in the US and the Pittsburgh City Paper and other magazines newspapers have rated them as one of the best in town I have no idea who is voting but that is ridiculous When I arrived to pick up my take out order I noticed the place was vacant except for two couples at two tables The dish was overpriced and the portion was very small 17 00 for a simple green curry w beef and xtra serving of rice The sauce was bland and very watery The beef was tough and the vegetables were way overcooked I ve lived in the area for over 10 years and I ve had their food a few times It s always disappointing After this meal I decided to create a yelp account and post my thoughts 
-9hA4YGRb_HFbdy3O5O8Fg CMU I was more impressed with Squirrel Hill itself than I was with Bangkok Balcony My friend and I found this place on a vegan s guide to Pittsburgh type Web site and they were open late so that worked for us We found street parking very easily I was disappointed that most of the clothing stores were closed because there was such a great mix of vintage and new fashions I digress I really liked the layout of BB how it s on the top floor and everything is modern without being sterile We both really liked the flatware they use here and that s something we almost never comment on They had a good selection of tofu items and I loved how they asked me to tell them how spicy I wanted my food on a scale from one to ten The food here is also more inexpensive than I would have thought seeing how packed the place was and how nicely decorated Overall it was good but I m biased I love Thai food so much that I could eat it all the time The reason I m only giving this place three stars is because we both felt a little sick later on in the evening 
-9jXE9VxESK4l8rYcgvaUg CMU Lots of pizzas and salads on the menu a decent looking wine list and some nice beers on tap including one offering from East End Brewing Company Big Hop There are some nice tables available outside on the porch and plenty of indoor seating and a bar The service was somewhat lacking they didn t even bring me silverware and the server seemed to run away when I tried to ask for a napkin I tried the asparagus pizza and crab salad sandwich Both were decent although not incredible and the pizza was definitely on the salty side I ll probably be back although I wasn t overjoyed with what I had 
-AIkr_WSpXlXeYPi1VZ-dQ CMU This is a great place to eat at before you go to a play at the Benedum It s ideal for a small group as the place is small and very busy before plays If you can I reccomend making reservations beforehand 
-Ba28A5Gj8IyWMznM3hCJw CMU The food is great The beer selection is great the prices are amazing 
-bcreRgXhbkyfe4fEHHCRw CMU So after my 2 stars everyone was horrified How did you not like it How did you give them 2 stars So we decided to go to back and give it another try We started with 2 drinks a glass of Riesling which was one of the best glasses of Riesling I have ever had ever I went on a wine tour of the finger lakes a few eyars ago and had almost nothing but rieslings and this was better J had the Sunny Day or something like that with tequila Definitely not good It was supposed to have a citrus flavor with it but it really just tasted like a cup of tequila Good tequila but not a god drink We started with the lamb riblets Amazing Excellent lamb flavor and a delicious rhubarb chutney I would have preferred more bite with the chutney but the lamb was really amazing I then had the salmon which came with turnips and swiss chard with a red wine reduction and a lemon sauce Nothing really blew me out of the water here except the lemon sauce It was perfect The salmon was cooked perfectly but what was lacking was the seasoning I think everything would have been perked up a bit with a little more seasoning J had the lobster ravioli which was the best thing ever I really think the ravioli was stuffed with an entire lobster the sauce I have no idea what the sauce was but it was delicious This was really really good I cannot go on enough about how really fantastic this was We also got the tallow fries with mayo They were delicious but probably not worth the heart clogging calories from using the tallow All in all this was a delicious meal and I am very happy that we went back for a second try 
-bDydurT_OQAlEsOmvoxLA CMU Took a couple of friends there recently It was a weekend afternoon so we didn t face what I hear is the usual crush of people PROs One of my friends was visiting from Italy and tells me that the pizza at The Porch is the closest he s had to northern Italian pizza EVER in the US I guess that s a good thing if you re looking for authentic Italian pizza I enjoyed the pizza thin crispy crust and NOT overloaded with toppings The sandwich and salad I had was fresh and crisp The service was okay friendly and prompt but the server did disappear and not check back after we had our entrees CONs Out of several menu items on both visits but that could be cost of serving fresh food I ll be back It s good to have a comfortable place like The Porch so close by 
-bIXhh7YOXzzIkfCxJi-og CMU Okay so I m not a Pittsburgher by blood and I couldn t avoid all the hype about this place when I first came to college at UPITT In one word I would say that this place is a gimmick The fries aren t great the slaw is not coleslaw but vinegar ed and peppered cabbage meat portions are minuscule the only thing that s really good about the sandwiches is the bread which varies depending on when you go On a good day it s super fresh and soft Pittsburghers love french fries on everything that s the Pittsburgh way But there are better combinations and better places to get your Pittsburgh style cuisine Eat here to say that you ve tried it and then move on to new and better restaurants 
-CEOGs3GAUdk_bUqmy5XUQ CMU Went back for a late night dessert and drinks It was busy and bustling for a Friday Night in Oakland The warm bread pudding was delicious Their alcoholic twist on an Arnold Palmer was great I applaud anyone who makes their own limoncello Sitting at the bar is fun on the kitchen side because you get to see all the action and feel the warm glow of their oven Servers are still very friendly of course I really got a kick out of seeing menus cut up and recycled as bar coasters Be warned though their bar only had the ingredients to make the cocktails on their menu Full bar isn t quite accurate It s probably due to space but I hope this changes I look forward to a nice gin cocktail on the outside porch on a hot day Small update went back for brunch again had the biscuits and gravy and a seasonal soda The soda was apple ginger and AMAZING I say again AMAZING The biscuits and gravy was too much food and made me feel like a glutton but that s my own dietary mistake I could only eat 3 out of the 4 homemade biscuits before giving up 
-DnZVGWCfysnZFSnJF3gsA CMU so far so good trendy AND tasty I have learned from some more experienced Yelp ers to always visit a restaurant at least twice before the final Yelp But I just went to legume a brand new restaurant in Regent Square and couldn t wait to Yelp about it Legume feels like it should be in San Francisco the unassuming brick front hides a light and bright interior Tin ceiling school house lighting botanical prints antique mismatched furniture a great ambiance I would live inside this place seriously They don t try to get away with just looking pretty this sadly often happens with new restaurants in pgh The food was quite good as well I had a vegetarian stew perfect portion size tasty and fresh along with the watermelon gazpacho which was spicy and refreshing Don t be fooled by the name either They have meat dishes too two types of steak on the menu when I visited Supposedly the menu changes all the time which is also reassuring Definitely worth trying and if you don t like it you can always cross the street to Dee s and get some hotdogs afterwards 
-EjzMuTbmnbatY4FTc2bhA CMU Love Crepes Parisiennes 
-eMf_tBvrosAVKSiyALyfw CMU What a waste of money Unless maybe you re wasted I had high hopes considering the novelty of rooftop dining in Pittsburgh For the price point the food and service should be a lot better The hostesses were rude refused to sit us in the booth and then immediately sat a couple in a booth right after us Server was sweet but painfully slow and never refilled our water The cocktails were no where what was described about 10 12 bucks a pop and zero buzz A couple that was seated a few minutes after us was finished with their main course 15 minutes before we even go ours And when we did it was very disappointing The guacamole was just mashed avocados no seasoning whatsoever The rice was clearly a mix like Zatarans or something and the beans were equally unseasoned and appeared to have been poured out of a can and undrained Really gross The shrimp in the tacos were well cooked but it was all downhill from there no flavor overcooked veggies and to top off two really thick and cold corn tortillas for each taco Having no flavor is the worst crime against Mexican food Being slow and rude the worst crime against service Really terrible place 
-fdWy2YBR0mrSWyqo0OapA CMU I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend for dinner We decided to come here after randomly seeing it featured on a repeat of Guy Fieri s Diners Drive Ins And Dives earlier in the week The outside is not too much to look at but the inside is comfortable Appropriately we were seated right underneath a Guy Fieri poster that proclaimed that the Veal Parmigiana as big as yer head As you would expect with food that large it seemed that everyone that was leaving the restaurant had a to go box We knew from the episode that they make their wedding soup from scratch daily and so started off with a cup of that It had a good taste to it and had much more chicken flavor than most wedding soups that I have had in the past The escarole as a green was also pretty nice For my entree I decided on having the Veal Parmigiana sandwich as I wanted to see how big it actually was while my girlfriend decided upon the lasagna Both portions were quite large with the sandwich being as large as advertised and I have a picture to prove it It actually ended up being so big that I could not possibly fit my mouth around it So I ended up taking off the top which essentially made it into two open faced sandwiches The bread was crispy while the veal was fried nicely and the sauce and cheese complimented the rest nicely My only complaint with it is that it was a bit dry and I think that some more sauce could have been helpful with that Even so the half of the sandwich that I ate tasted good My girlfriends lasagna also seemed to be a super sized portion as it filled up her whole plate It had a lot of ricotta cheese in it which helped to give it an overall flavor that I enjoyed Like almost everyone else that I saw we ended up leaving with some to go boxes as I still had half of my sandwich left and my girlfriend half of her lasagna The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future It was a cool little place in which you definitely get a huge portion size for your money and the food is pretty good too 
-Fn581LmjquGcguvSrH8mw CMU Chicken under a freaking skillet I tear up just thinking about it I almost never order chicken at a fine dining restaurant but heard rave reviews from a chef friend and had to try All of the other entrees simply disappear on the page now when I am at legume I dream about this chicken It is so simple and so perfectly executed The rest of the menu is very good as well I have had excellent pates and mousses and many other great mains fish and steak The only dishes I have been under impressed by are the soups which I have generally found bland The ambience in the dining room could be improved a bit It is just a little too sterile The bar on the other hand is an excellent space Overall an excellent restaurant 
-HEjaAyy6cgDDhXSXJIuAg CMU Good sandwich selections I had the Rachel corned beef with coleslaw along with a side of potato salad The Russian sauce they put on the sandwich is a little on the sweet but I think it worked well The potato salad is also very eggy and a little sweeter than normal but I didn t mind The staff was friendly and my food came in a timely manner 
-hFPrtyQwS-yEkrojuao3Q CMU This little bar and grill makes me want to move to Pittsburgh so bad I ve been here twice Once in 2009 and again in 2011 and the food and booze always makes me happy Both of my visits were for the Pittsburgh Bacon Bash and of course I ate tons of bacon things but I also grabbed a few items from the amazing menu of humorously named entrees and appetizers My favorite app was the bacon chicken wings which were lightly battered and bathed in BaconSalt and then topped with crumbled bacon awesomeness With a big bacon bloody mary it s the perfect meal I also had The Central Park The Old Fashioned Hog Heaven the Bacontini a few cosmos of greatness and a lot of great local beer For such a small place the beer options are great While the prices were a bit high 12 for some of the drinks compared to anything near me the quality and quantity both make it worth the bucks I also played What s Up Pussycat on the jukebox 10 times in a row and made a lot of people laugh hysterically 
-IpueLB2t0jHuDByzN6WrQ CMU Most of their food is just okay I ve been there once and got fried mushrooms loaded cheese fries and wings The cheese fries were good the mushrooms were kinda not good But the wings were some of the best I had The bartender had his own sauce recipe not on the menu he said it was mayo hot sauce and I think some italian seasoning dressing Either way they were saucy delicious They are also fried breading covered which is not usual But it made them that much better 
-Ivw9EPwdASuO8Fq5k4MgQ CMU I think this place is pretty tasty And I ve never really noticed problems with service Maybe I m just not looking hard enough for all of these faults that everyone else finds here 
-J81R-4gwrLGp5eMzPldOw CMU On my way home from work I always walk by this place and I always see people walking into here So I decided to give it a shot and see what s up I m not a health freak or a food guru nor am I picky about food but this place is just plain bad The 5 meal is pretty decent until they charge you an extra 2 for lo mein instead of rice But the biggest thing that bothers me is the huge puddle of oil that the food sits in Again I m not a health freak but eatting this food just made me feel guilty With every bite I think about getting a heart attack at 27 There s as much oil as there sauce and you see the thick oil floating above don t expect a fantastic dining area either it s dark and feels icky I ve had my fair share of cheap chinese food and this is probably the worst I ve tried 
-JwFk3RhcJ3qxn4n-XpqWw CMU dear lulu what s happened to you you used to be the refuge for my asian food fix but your food leaves something to be desired lately dr fu s noodles has way too much salt noodle bowls are only ok you re a noodle place after all no excuses for being less than stellar the bibimbop looks like a medley of canned products and tastes like it i really want to like you you do have a great menu selection terrific drinks very cool vibe great location and efficient waitstaff but something in the kitchen really needs to change please please i hate to say but it s not me it s you 
-k4mb6Jbw6PXvpiKYOMGiw CMU I m sorry guys really I understand every place has to have something they can boast and call their own but with all of the hype I was beyond greatly disappointed in the food Soggy as a rain drenched rat and as tasteless as one of the Kardashians I am all for a good corned beef sandwich when I find one but not here Seriously save you time and energy fighting with a crowd and go to Sammy s instead At least you can taste the meat on their sandwiches The single star isn t to be spiteful but for the shattered expectations 
-l1IBz5wVa40uhgPDK8JYw CMU I have always bee a fan of the big burrito restaurants My boyfriend and i have been there 4 times and each time it has been amazing the decor is excellent and its dark and even romantic they also have a hip bar with couches and they open it up during the summer During certain holidays they have the chefs tasting menu which has 4 courses My boyfriend got that during their thanksgiving special and he LOVED IT I have gotten the spinach and mushroom dumplings as a starter a couple of times and they were amazing the pepper dipping sauce was soo delicious for my entree i got the red curry tofu and the flavors were amazing it was very filling and all the vegetables blended well for desert i got the caramel bomb and it was DELISH I ve had the vegetarian pad thai on a different occasion and that was pretty amazing too They dont have too many vegetarian options i kind of wish they did They have a great wine and cocktail selection too For non vegetarians the chefs tasting options they have every once in a while are amazing 
-lCoKEY7YOa440w7S7oHoQ CMU I had a day off from work today and since I ve been looking for a good sandwich place since Kazansky s closed I thought I d try Uncle Sam s Believe me folks the subs here are ridiculously large I know that Uncle Sam s is known for their fries but that s why I skipped them I went for the salami and cheese sub which was pretty tasty But I guess subs don t do it for me like a good sammitch does 
-LSU888BtxdRe-Ziy0NuBg CMU Incredible I had the pumpkin soup a favorite of mine this was the second best I ve had 1 belongs to Abay I also had the tofu platter veggies were spot on cooked until soft but still retaining shape color and texture My companion had the vegetable coconut soup which was overflowing with all sorts of veggies and the broth was just heavenly He also ordered mussaman chicken curry which consisted of big chunks of chicken and potatoes that were simmered in the sweet yet spicy mussaman sauce I actually ended up dipping my veggies in his sauce it was so wonderful We both got a spice level 9 which provided just enough heat without making your nose run The staff were friendly and efficient Can t wait to go back 
-mo3b7vqoY1KCCuju6voyQ CMU Szmidt s is fantastic Go there Delicious homemade bread corned beef pastrami etc Artfully made sandwiches choice of classic or new world prirogies burgers deli sides great prices easy parking The owners staff are very friendly and welcoming and the interior of the deli is clean and attractive My fiancee ordered The Szmidt featuring homemade pastrami provolone caramelized onions thinly sliced pickles and mustard I had the Szmidt s version of a Reuben The Sassano homemade corned beef swiss homemade kraut and thousand island dressing It was definitely one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life and I m a sandwich lover The meat was tender flavorful and not fatty The kraut offered a nice sour kick without being overpowering The bread was outstanding nicely yeasty and homemade tasting sliced a little thickly I wasn t very hungry but I couldn t help but eat the entire sandwich They are not huge but generously sized with a perfect proportion of ingredients Interesting fact You can add a fried egg on top for 99 if that s your thing 
-NdNWhl9NPhlfsZ8E3tzyw CMU We just love this tiny hole in the wall sushi place The interior is very homely and has a good atmosphere When you order any of the meals which they have a good selection of and is very authentic there is always a starting salad with japanese ginger dressing which is excellent a piece of fried chicken that is succulent and also a small bowl of miso soup that is just the right flavor The sushi here is always fairly fresh and they carry some of the harder to find fish such as fatty tuna The only negative we find with this restaurant is the small seating capacity and combined with the popularity and lack of the ability to make reservations sometimes it is a long wait If you want good Japanese food in Pittsburgh definitely visit this place 
-oiSCg_xXuXUgWd4Ncnehw CMU Dropped in for a snack What we sampled The plain pretzel balls good texture and flavor Jalapeno cheese dip good and spicy but it was a little thin so it had trouble adhering to the outside of the pretzel balls Cinnamon sugar pretzel balls delicious Berry cream cheese dip outstanding Tasted so good on both of the pretzel balls Overall this was a nice quite place to try out a snack but I have not returned since mostly because each time I have passed by it looks closed 
-OzJoWurVQm-tTndBeMYqg CMU Everyone loves Peter s No really I don t get it either Service is good enough during off hours The waitresses are friendly and the bar service is prompt It s a little dingy but what do you expect from an Oakland bar The drink selection itself is laughable Nothing creative and no killer money saving specials here The draft beers are limited to macros with the occasional high end import or domestic I d give Peter s a higher rating if they closed during the peak hours It s just awful then Everyone goes to Peter s in Oakland so expect significant crowds on Friday Saturday nights Don t wear nice clothes unless you want them to be covered in a mix of your sweat other people s sweat and drinks that ll inevitably spill on you Also be prepared to stand at the bar for upwards of 20 minutes to get a drink It s that crowded The bouncers don t really do their job Some dude was passed out in a chair for a half hour I think that s grounds for being booted but who am I to judge Peter s has an equally crowded bar upstairs too with a stage area that doubles as a sizeable dance floor Cover is free unless there s a band playing but you probably don t want to see a shitty band at a shitty bar anyway Oh and the best part is that every night a different fraternity and sorority storm the bar at around 12 doubling the crowding and wait time Seriously don t go here unless you have to There are better cheaper bars in Oakland 
-P50RgNcIVbkcdrSyAfASg CMU Don t go to Qdoba across the street Veracruz has decent Mexican food and good prices Fast service and good quality Probably the best enchiladas verdes in PGH but you can do better at home armed with one of Diana Kennedy or Rick Bayless s cookbooks If you re in a rush though this is your best option on that strip 
-p6D-iXzxQjMRlRSLmIZLg CMU Food is solid especially for a place whose main focus is on being a bar and a see and be seen spot Pleasantly surprised by very good prompt and friendly service Wouldn t go here as a destination for a meal but when you re on Walnut and aren t up for the usual bar fare or one of the more upscale places it s a good compromise with reliably decent to very good food 
-pmQpCkrqfzMzuAS_7HoDw CMU Best fast food burgers you can get ANYWHERE I spent the summer in CA and had In n Out Burger a few times and there s no comparison The toppings and fries make it the best Load up your burger fo free 
-PpqDndVuOvXnD_VlUshfg CMU A fantastic place to grab brunch on a weekend We tried the special Banana Walnut Hotcakes and that was sooo delish We also ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and that Corned Beef was even better than the ones from Le Peep back in NJ SO wish we had a Pamela s back home and the prices in Pitt was VERY cheap comparing to NYC and NJ PS This is a CASH ONLY place and setting is very much like a diner but AWESOME food ENJOY 
-pVKws8fk7RfNZL2ywOZkA CMU Falafel is ok but nothing special It s been served twice in what can only be described as a salad with a little bit of falafel sprinkled in Also it s mushy not crispy on the outside which is not necessarily bad but not my particular favorite However what s up with those fries They are amazing 
-QRIGiPqJ0uqBG3zJfDFzA CMU This place is a disappointment It took 2 hours to get my pizza when they told me 45 minutes to an hour I was told the first time the driver was leaving in 2 minutes and I was his only stop It took another 50 minutes to get to my house I live about 10 minutes away When it finally got to my house after three calls and two hours it was cold When I put it in the microwave it wasn t even good warm pizza The Pizza was okay at best just not worth a 2 hour wait I will avoid this place going forward Pizza Sola is way better 
-rMKUVJBGz2uL5LfiPPBXg CMU Chinese food for white people You can tell they have some skill in cooking and the ingredients tasted fresh but it s extremely Americanized Chinese food The flavors taste seriously wrong to a Chinese palate If you re white and prefer lighter less oily psuedo Chinese fare it s one of the better places I ve tried 3 stars because I m Chinese 
-rY3QVEehLcvFrEV1wMrCQ CMU Came for Dim Sum They have standard dim sum choices Overall it was mediocre in my opinion I agree with many of the other reviews here Missing Golden Palace 
-sn53qddNleVESGKreB60w CMU I don t see the big deal about Soba Lounge I thought the food was only okay and I didn t like all of the flavors overpowering each other The ambience is really nice and the servers are friendly but the food was just alright for me 
-T-y8RdCrm2TB4ejYi8h3w CMU Service can be a bit slow at times Also I rarely see the place crowded Still its a good place to eat Usually people go for the daily specials where they give you a big plate with their house salad delicious a daily changing entree rice and some bread It s about 10 dollars They usually have 2 vegetarian and 2 non vegetarian daily options I love their limeade its terrifically bright and fresh made from real limes Also if you happen to be really rich which I m not you might fancy buying some of the Peruvian art they sell in the store Try touching the pelts on your way out probably the softest fur you ve ever felt in your life Also they have fun finger dolls knit to look like naked people The nudists sell for about 3 bucks a pop though 
-taDjdmp94Tz-l9miE4z_Q CMU Finally a good Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh Even the decor and ambiance seems authentic with the family style tables paper tablecloths and slightly sticky seats The food is top notch we ordered from the Chinese menu rather than the American menu and were thrilled with our dishes I had shredded pork in garlic sauce and my husband had some sort of duck with Devil s Tongue yams Oh actually I suppose I did order from the American menu I got a cup of hot and sour soup and loved it Perfect for a cold night The waiter was terrific he gave our 6 month old a fortune cookie wrapped in crinkly plastic which kept her entertained for quite awhile By the time we left around 6 30 on a weeknight there was a decent crowd and all seemed to be enjoying themselves We re looking forward to going again 
-tDgy-Lwcgt07atC4_Qp9g CMU This is the only place in Oakland that takes reservations Ergo this is the only place we as the chemistry department at Pitt tend to take seminar speakers so as not to make them wait for a table during the typical Oakland lunch rush That being said I ve been here ALOT I wouldn t say anything stands out as a must have but their pizza is probably the best thing on the menu I ve never been disappointed in it I ve had their mozzarella tomato salad and their pan seared salmon salad when I ve been on a health kick and they were pretty good Simple and satisfied my desire to eat light The bruschetta and calamari appetizers are my go to choices The only thing I don t like and perhaps this is crazy but that piece of bread that comes with the salads But now I m nit picking It s bread for gosh sake 
-tdqnQP_1kuz8TBEKmwHMw CMU Delicious food and great atmosphere It s a great restaurant for a special occasion but not for your average dinner out 
-tnqO9J1PuBAt_2T2Zu2tA CMU Hemingway s is good at what it intends to do get college students drunk The drink selection is pretty terrible unless you like discount shots with no top shelf liquor and mediocre at best draft choices I never went here much as an undergrad and I only go now before 9pm and only for the exceptional grilled cheeses they have a great variety and all are made with thick Italian bread If you work in Oakland you can t beat a delicious non chain restaurant sandwich for 5 99 7 99 
-W3YFr1jGFt3rQcXV09gwQ CMU OMG am I so ready to go back to San Francisco that I just can t wait any longer for Asian food And now I ve found the 6th thing that is more expensive in Pittsburgh than San Francisco The Thai food here in Shadyside Sure it s decent tasting nothing out of this world Portions are rather small by Pittsburgh standards But curry for 12 95 I mean you can get the same dish for almost half the price in SF I know it s Walnut Street but why are the prices so high Next time I ll hold out a little longer 
-WGsDynTp6HuJnHf1SKvXQ CMU Joe Mama s is just lacking too many things There s a lack of atmosphere lack of great food and lack of great drinks The food is decent but don t expect too much Overall look elsewhere there are better places very very close by The food is Italian but pretty uninspired Olive Garden is better and I really don t like Olive Garden The drinks are pretty standard cocktails but not particularly strong or reasonably priced The atmosphere is annoying I m not sure why I dislike it so much but I do I think it s just weird to have a dinerish theme but be italian food 
-w_clzqI9bQuZ6Zig1DnVg CMU Spice Island is popular among our hospital crew to order from for lunch in Oakland via Wheel Deliver I have never actually been in the restaurant so my review will be based strictly on the food I have had the pad thai and java fried rice from Spice Island and both are just OK and forgettable The biggest complaint I have with each dish I ve had is that the quality of meat and seafood is not very good The shrimp in my pad thai was strange tasting and tough and the meat I ve had in other dishes was fatty Another pet peeve of mine is the amount of grease and oil in the dishes I expect a certain amount of oil but this literally leaves puddles of the stuff at the bottom Finally each dish I ve had is disappointingly flavorless The portions are HUGE but I d rather pay for less food with more flavor I have heard great things from friends about Spice Island so I d like to actually go to the restaurant to eat some time but I think I ll be passing for lunch for now on 
-YcvdC9vdVLPwd0eH1MvuQ CMU I had the opportunity to eat at Toast again this year and I can say that it was even better than before The menu was great and the Black Drum which I had never heard of before was excellent I highly recommend eating at Toast if you are in Pittsburgh and looking for somewhere to exceed your expectations 
-YNFThuMpCz4nhl3lbsB-w CMU This is one of my favorite hidden lunch spots in the city despite it not actually being very hidden I see other people have dealt with a female shop keeper but every time I go it s Frank And Frank is gruff and on point Don t expect masturbatory groveling complete with smiles instead look forward to a great meal made by someone who takes the time to craft each dish with care from scratch The shwarma is amazing though get the chicken and not the meat and the falafel is the most authentic you ll be able to get your hands on in this city Finally I normally hate baklava as it s normal dry and and made of prepackaged philo but the baklava served here is almost reason enough to drive all the way out to squirrel hill 
-Z9sb0HiYVtMQQd0E0DRBg CMU i think i m in love i had heard about pamela s before and that it s the best place for brunch but i hadn t had a chance to go until yesterday i get inside and was not exactly blown away small diner style cash only restaurant but ok at least it will probably be cheap right the menu looks pretty promising interesting choices breakfast and lunch not a huge menu but not bad i decide to go with the feta and spinach omelet with the potatoes and my friend that went with me went with the crepe hotcakes the food comes and i begin to dig in bam the magic occurs the omelet was tasty and the potatoes were even tastier i had a bite of my friend s hotcakes and was blown away moral of the story don t judge a book by it s cover the food entirely speaks for itself and makes this place a 5 star worthy breakfast joint 
-_K9KqNH0hJqu-bCxgkhdg CMU Bangkok Balcony was really my first foray into Thai food and it set the bar high The environment is relatively elegant particularly for the Squirrel Hill area and the food is delicious I particularly remember having great service some the waiters even started to recognize me and I didn t go that often I also remember the neat weighted silverware but that doesn t exactly figure into the review Anyway I was a big fan of this place for all 4 years of my college experience Definitely recommend if you re looking for a non hole in the wall Asian food experience 
-_lJP5u4rhDDt130ci_6dw CMU I wish I could write separate reviews for their gelato and for the rest of their food The gelato would easily get 5 stars It s not as rich as real Italian gelato but the flavors are excellent As for the food well it s just okay After the Yelp Elite event there which was awesome my wife and I went back for lunch and had the bufala mozzarella pizza and the portobello salad The pizza tasted okay but the consistency was all off The dough was soggy too much sauce and limp and nothing actually stayed on the pizza it all just fell right off The salad was also okay the lemon zest was a nice touch but it was pretty uninspired Just a bunch of arugula and maybe 1 2 a mushroom cap that s it If I were in a pinch I would probably go back but it won t be my top choice That said get the gelato 
-_PYOWJQn4N1-qUkYi6faw CMU When you first come to Pittsburgh everyone will urge you to go to Primanti s or Primanny s in Yinzer I think it was ok but not great at this particular location The restaurant is kind of cramped and dirty and it seems like there is a layer of grease on everything The service is pretty poor at the counter although in one visit and older man waited at our table and he was quite good The portions are generous the sandwich bread is good and the fries are very good Unfortunately there are two issues 1 the coleslaw is not so great More like lettuce with vinegar 2 the meat quality is not great Most of the sandwiches I ve had are questionable in their meat either too greasy or odd textured I go back every few months hoping to be wowed and it just hasn t happened maybe the hype outshines the reality 
-_rPf-j0Fy2kP2LMCRWyBA CMU Really nothing special to this place except the outside seating they have in the summer Recently came here and my friend ordered a Coors Light draught wimp i know but it tasted absolutely awful Don t know if it was the keg that was bad or the hoses that hook up to the keg that need to be cleaned Next I got a Turkey Rachel Probably one of the most flavorless sandwiches I ve ever had The only thing I could really taste was the rye bread it was on which was quite good My friend got the veggie powerhouse salad He did seem to enjoy that I had a bite as well and I will say not bad Overall service was super slow I don t think I ll be back for a meal anytime soon It s just too mediocre to waste your time money or calories here 
0-wEqR7HaV7j7Bff0k2AFA CMU First off I loved the atmosphere and layout of this restaurant so much that I knew I would be coming back again and again I ordered pretty boring things so I don t feel it s fair for me to rate the food entirely I did try my friend s dishes and really enjoyed the duck as well as the roast beef sandwich I was also a big fan of their crispy taters I ll definitely be back again 
027XE8NLsC_NyqAIHMhGfQ CMU I ve eaten at Lulu s Noodles two times now and have mixed feelings about the food The restaurant itself has a very casual and atmosphere during lunch you order at the counter as most of its patrons are Pitt Carnegie Mellon students The restaurant is clean and spacious and the service is wonderful As it is a pan Asian restaurant don t expect its food to very authentic to any particular region I was very surprised as what was passed off as pho the first time I ate there It was certainly not anything like what you would get at an actual Vietnamese restaurant the broth was bland and I think they used the wrong kind of noodles and it didn t come with lime lemon I should have known better I did however LOVE their pad thai which was also not very authentic no tamarind paste etc It was good though because I was craving a carb fest So all in all I d give it three stars they have their own interpretations of classic Asian dishes and whether their interpretations of them are good or not is a crap shoot 
030otpgEln8EftKbFTjYZg CMU We went to Legume on Saturday for dinner The restaurant is small but friendly atmosphere We had the pre fix four course dinner The menu changes periodically but the flavor remains consistent and wonderful For appetizers we had turnip soup and sate mushrooms Entrees we picked duck and salmon Lastly panna cotta for desert Everything was delicious The service was excellent We definitely return to try out new menus and recommend this place anytime 
036Y51JBWpYS-gwO3EJUxQ CMU FUKU My friend and I were headed to our old trusty Sushi Boat in Oakland and realized that Sushi Fuku had opened We decided to go there instead and let s just say it s added to our list of places to eat lunch at once a week It s clean it s new the stuff is fresh you can create your own sushi you can create your own rice bowls My friend likened it to creating a burrito bowl at Chipotle What I m most impressed with are the machines that lay the rice on the seaweed wrapper and the one that cuts the sushi into 10 perfect pieces It loses a little authenticity because it s not done by hand BUT it s still awesome to watch Definitely worth a try if you re in search of sushi in Oakland I think it will win over the other 2 sushi places that are within steps of each other on Oakland Ave Sushi Boat and Oishi Bento 
03_nKqlRhIrTWW7AoRX4zw CMU I eat at Harris all the time I don t even MEAN to I just happen to end up here a lot I think it s because it s the kind of place that lots of people can agree on pretty good food and drinks and a KILLER patio For me the patio kicks it up from 4 to 5 stars in the winter they don t serve lunch In the summer this place is hoppin all the time and yes I m that jerk hogging a giant table waiting for my friends to show up they re just PARKING speaking of parking don t park in the lot next door you WILL get towed None of the other reviews mentioned yet that they recently changed the menu one of the great new additions is the BBQ pork sandwich I love it in slider form get the coleslaw with it and stick it on the sando delish I don t even LIKE coleslaw including on a primanti s bros sando so you know it s good The mac and cheese add the andouille sausage is a staple and you can get a mini version as a side to an entree for just a little extra Another new addition is the chicken fried bacon yes you read that correctly It is a hearty plate of bacon that is battered and fried and comes with white gravy I ve shared it 3 times with friends and each time it s been a little different but also kind of left me a little queasy although with a happy novelty food feeling I would definitely not recommend one person trying to eat this unless they were trying to commit suicide by bacon which I also don t recommend and I LOVE bacon Overall I love this place and I don t think the drinks are more expensive than most of the other places on Ellsworth half price frozen cosmos are definitely worth it Service is also usually great 
04GYPYEv7f8dwsY0uNF7rg CMU Reasonable priced draft beers They have Arrogant Bastard Ale on tap which makes my husband very happy Good service Bathrooms are fairly clean for a bar 
05-zqoeAUf-uQ6N5Nynfjw CMU Wow Best sandwich I ve had in ages I had to grab a quick bite asked the guy how long it would take and he said ten but I must have had my sandwich in five minutes tops I took a bite and it rivaled anything I have eaten in NYC or elsewhere Fresh bread great corned beef even the kraut was incredible and I normally don t like sauerkraut Cant wait to try some of the other menu items I hear they might start delivery soon Please include Oakland Shadyside or hook up with Wheel Deliver 
05auyEYDj36oZ06fU_haCQ CMU It s a great place to go to eat late at night if you are hungry Open 24 hours 
05VmdOADSoRmG3567ewNQg CMU I found the food to be good but a bit overpriced I liked that they were BYOB The atmosphere was fine but nothing amazing 
05_c3I8O10lspJKNhJ1nIA CMU great baked grinder on great bread at a great price like the sizes not like some places you get way too big and pay for it have nice selection including cookies and sides even nicer that they delivered 
06AelOOA0u-wY4dfiCPURA CMU I will forever remember this drive through conversation Welcome to Wendy s Can I take your order Yeah I d like a Frescuit We ain t got no hashbrowns um all I want it a Frescuit A ight I m just lettin you know 
07yWI_uOQKnL-LvMOdPHFA CMU I went to Soba with some co workers on a work trip to Pittsburgh The wine selection was pretty impressive there was something for every taste and the food was good Not the best pad thai I ve ever eaten pretty dry like it had been sitting a while but my co workers enjoyed their meals Would go back again if I were in the area 
0acKpg8G7jOutRDtPUlLKw CMU I used to live around the corner from this place and worked across the street at the hospital Ritters is a great 24 7 greasy spoon diner with adorable vintage juke boxes at the booths waitresses who have been there forever and patrons who have been lifers as well Its certainly not a place to go for health food or fine cuisine but its great breakfast food and even greater place to be for late night after the bar drinking 
0awQicUktjE9OTtI5GTkPQ CMU Best chicken cheesesteak in the world Period And like everyone says the fries obviously have liberal amounts of crack The waffle fries were even better but I went back recently to find that they are not seasoned and not quite as good Minus one star for that 
0b4ZD1OXUJ1AR7Daho6NTA CMU I just went to UP and couldn t wait to write this review Based on the previous reviews I thought this restaurant would be great however it was NOT This is by far the worst meal I have had in a very long time Let s start with the drinks I had a cinnamon sangria which was watered down and tasted awful I didn t even drink it I had the waitress return it for something else and she still put it on my bill Have they ever heard of customer service where I m from when I return a drink I don t expect it on my bill I then tried the Peach Bellini I am not sure who the bartender is but the last time I checked Prosecco should be served chilled I received an extremely warm drink We also ordered a white wine which was shockingly also served warm This place should really invest in a wine cooler or an ice bucket either one would solve this problem Now to the food We ordered off the small plates the sea scallops and the grilled wild texas shrimp I can sum up the taste of both of these meals simply SALT overload All I could taste on both of these meals was seasoning and not good seasoning It was absolutely disgusting For our main course we ordered the jambalaya The rice although spicy was drowning in a pool of water which washed off any flavor in it Like the sea scallops and shrimp from my previous meal this was also extremely salty I wish I could give this place zero stars but unfortunately I m forced to give it one As on overpriced restaurant the food was horrendous and the drinks were even worse P S I have lived in Manhattan my entire life and recently moved to Pittsburgh this restaurant is nothing near what meal in New York would consist of I am not sure where all these great reviews came from 
0bpfJ6_wpk8FsT5jQ24Mzw CMU Indian food is my favorite kind of food and considering I m French it s kinda funny and this is one of the better restaurants in Pittsburgh Their prices are very reasonable and they have many different discount offers going on every week I highly recommend 
0BQM7Q-uC8wSL9JC_ZkRzA CMU Cheap Get the teriyaki chicken on the lunch menu but get it spicy It s decent Like the new sushi bar Decent chinese if you re around CMU and need a cheap lunch 
0bRBAT2PZZAR4LIO5diBMg CMU It was probably a nice restaurant twenty some years ago the locale is a converted pretty Victorian with stain glass windows the bar area displays a disused grand piano propping up bottles of wine the dining room still sports a pastel palette of sea foam and salmon and framed 80 s posters of the same color scheme grace the walls The menu is marginally more updated than the decor Some dishes remind me of food fads from the 90 s e g the chef seems to have a penchant for meat and fruit pairing Overall the menu is too long and rambling without a theme covering everything from the Baja to the Mediterranean The food was unremarkable The bread tasted like a generic supermarket baguette it was served with olive oil and powdery parm i e from the green can For appetizers we ordered the prosciutto and figs as well as the trout and peaches They were probably the highlight of the meal but the portions were tiny and the ingredients were not the best For the main course I tried their fish taco which was on the bland and dry side Summary if you are ever nostalgic for fine dining in a small American town during the 80 s this place is for you 
0bs4yinYRyEp55PjUgxXYQ CMU The food is amazing which is what causes the common wait however its definately worth the wait The vegetarian crepe is one of the most amazing meals you could ask for the tomatoes are slightly spicy and the soytang dressing compliments the crepe well This is one restaurant I doubt I would ever tire of I would often go with friends order a savory crepe and split a sweet one with a friend My mouth is watering just thinking of the yummy food 
0bsTBG5BaYtyVzkxB0RzuA CMU American Chinese food is greasy and terrible everywhere and that s what we know and love about it However Chopstix has accomplished the amazing feat of actually making greasy fried food taste bland One day I came home craving Chinese and serendipitously found one of their menus stuffed in my mailbox along with some absurdly good coupons I placed a huge order and paid almost nothing for it I guess I got what I paid for because the food was barely edible The Cold Sesame Noodles were just plain noodles no sauce and I don t think the Fried Rice was actually fried but it was inexplicably neon yellow in color I couldn t even find the chicken in my General Tso s it was mostly breading and a sweet and sour sauce I learned my lesson Trust me don t get sucked in by their prices just say NO to Chopstix 
0ckme5ZCkmidTGUUdFdNyw CMU Good if not great place to get a meal at Mom and I were having a girls day out and we decided to stop in here for brunch before heading over to the Phipps The chicken n waffles organic fried chicken in gravy plus waffles caught my eye as did the eggs benedict But I was in the mood for some sweetness The cinnamon swirl French Toast with sausage links was pretty good Mmmm French Toast Pump that insulin Susan Pump Whoo hoo The cinnamon did give it a nice bite too Good thing Rick and I hit the bike trails the day beore Mom went for the roasted tomato and bacon frittata which looked good too Many of the negative comments here seem to be about the prices The dinner prices look high for what you get but the brunch prices run about 8 00 10 00 per entree Service here is good though 
0cW18BIMR23_F-oDOpJ4-A CMU I love Big Jim s It s honestly my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh The portions are huge the food is delicious and the price is good I ve had the lasagna several times and it has never disappointed Seriously the portion is huge The servers are always friendly and attentive I ve never had a bad experience at this restaurant 
0dJpD_47XNkUTPvTHASfJg CMU Very yummy I got to try a huge variety of dishes with a big group of friends who knew what they were ordering All dishes were great My favorites were Beef in Hot Broth Shredded Pork w Seasoned Tofu Braised Pork Shoulder Mao s Pork and Double Cooked Pork Belly Off the appetizers one of the Bean Jelly Noodles was delicious and Honey Pork Ribs were also great I know I just listed a ton of dishes because they were all awesome I m actually not great at handling spicy foods but everything was very flavorful with the right amount of spice for me and I didn t have too many problems afterwards Of course you might want to steer clear if you have acid reflux but they do have some good non spicy dishes available like the Braised Pork Shoulder Honey Pork Ribs Finally the prices may seem a little steep but they offer many dishes in two sizes The larger one is HUGE and the smaller portion is fairly regular sized The appetizers are pretty big as well They also put out a complimentary little plate of either fried wonton skins or Chinese style boiled peanuts for you to snack on before your meal Definitely recommend ordering family style and sharing dishes 
0Em-jbO2KKpYqkTveHrq0g CMU First off I love Thai food The mix of flavors found in Thai food are amazing and I m always looking for a new Thai place Silk Elephant always satisfies my taste for Thai Their food has a perfect mix of spiciness and tastiness and their Pad Thai is mad satisfying It has a great location right on Murray and their prices are reasonable Park at Giant Eagle and just walk down 
0ExKlT8WcbEfM2DtaQUv_w CMU Had dinner at Soba on a Thursday night with a friend Went around 6pm no reservations and were seated right away I was talking to my friend about my lack of knowledge of white wine when our waiter came over to fill up our waters He asked if I wanted to learn about white wines and offered us a tasting of 3 varieties He had us try them without telling us what they were The thoughtfulness and interest in pairing our wines with our dinner really made our night We started off with the crispy tofu which I always get and this time did not disappoint I had the mushroom and rice cake noodles and my friend had the seared tuna Both dishes were great aside from the kim chi on my friend s plate that was not very good My dish was on the spicy side so make sure to ask about spice level if that concerns you 
0fcNkPb1VGjfso34hJnIVA CMU I ve been waiting for a place like Yinzbugh BBQ for 34 years since I moved to the Burgh This is authentic BBQ with both Southern and Texas influences You find the Southern influence in the delicious BBQ pork delicate smoky and juicy but not at all greasy You can also get the real deal in terms of the BBQ sauces that are available South Carolina style mustard based sauce and North Carolina style vinegar based sauce The Texas influence is in the smoked brisket which literally melts in your mouth You can get this with the ketchup based sauce more popular in Texas Kansas City and Memphis The sides that I have had are the cole slaw and the black eyed peas both of which are outstanding The smoked tofu should delight vegetarians Others have complained about the store bought buns I think if you re looking for a fancy bun you re missing the point This place is all about the meat and the sauce The bun is just something to hold these mouthwatering ingredients together as well as some cole slaw which I recommend piling on your sandwich as well I also have to add that the service is great and the owner knows his stuff and is as nice as can be Check this place out You will not regret it 
0fj8HzJDOej5AcnNhN9AGA CMU I don t think it gets any better than this place In town celebrating a couple of birthdays we started our night at Toast and quickly found out why everyone we talked to described the place as fabulous While I can t say we had the most enthusiastic bar service while we waited for our table the bartender didn t seem to like that we asked him to take our picture so perhaps it was our fault since he was so busy things quickly took a turn for the best when we settled into our cozy booth and were given a tour of the menu by our knowledgeable and attentive server Between the 3 of us we sampled the Ahi Tuna uh maze ing the filet the arctic char and the flounder The wine list was well rounded uninhibited sophisticated and provided very reasonably priced and tasty selections After our meal our server offered to call us a cab so we could continue our celebrating but soon brought the sad news that it would take hours for one to get to us thanks to a Mr Bon Jovi and his concert His alternative suggestion The owner of the bar would drop us off on Ellsworth since he was going to go past it anyway Really When does that type of thing happen I wish I could give this place 10 stars but I ll have to settle with 5 Keep this place in mind when an occasion pops up and a great restaurant is needed You ll want to be here for it 
0FkIKjtHqpWF5GQpSdEEIg CMU Beer selection is incredible considering Oakland is dominated with macrobrew American adjunct lager bars Burgers are excellent Also recommend the Roll a fatty The ceilings are tall and voices echo like you re in a cave It can get very loud in this place 
0FoUAvcZ3I0KBz3z0Gk9uw CMU tl dr Wonderful food bad service I was quite impressed when we first entered Brasserie 33 as the restaurant itself has quite a nice interior It feels very modern and has a sleek look and feel to it My fiance and I were seated immediately and handed menus to look over The waiter we had was a gentlemen then entire time we were there but his skill seemed rather lacking This is perhaps due to the fact that we went on a Saturday afternoon this may not have been the A team of servers He took our drink orders and then a few minutes later took our food orders After taking our orders he simply walked away from our table leaving our menus which were simply printed sheets of paper not particularly nice looking there in front of me They sat there for a fairly long time and every time he walked by to serve the other tables I tried to move them more towards the edge of the table so he would notice them but he never did Finally right before our food was served a completely different waiter took them away Our meals were delicious I ordered the Croque Monsieur and my fiance had the Quiche Lorraine Both came with a side of fries and a side salad The food was delicious with the quiche in particular being stunning The eggs in the quiche were perfectly fluffy and light As a desert we ordered the chocolate mousse and again delicious Now during any other decent meal this would be the time when the waiter would ask if we were ready for our check He did not Over and over again he would walk by to other tables but not once did he say anything about bringing us our check Finally my fiance caught his eye and let him know that we had a Groupon we wished to use Apparently he considered it a great offense that we hadn t told him of this before the meal was started After this we had to wait at least 10 more minutes before we had to catch his attention AGAIN and ASK to be able to pay I have never had to ask to give someone my money before All in all the food was delicious and I would recommend the food but they very much need to improve their service 
0fV7Ct8aBGxC1MaZevWs_w CMU Great food good service good prices This is a nice small restaurant that s not too fancy but has really great food According to the website there is also one in Lawrenceville We tried the Green Curry Pad Thai and Crab Rolls We found the Pad Thai to be a bit too sweet but otherwise very good They have all of the standard Thai dishes and also some Phillipino food There was also a menu of monthly specials with some great looking dishes BYOB 
0Gmgv-gsz3tbn2qArkSz1Q CMU Fuel and Fuddle has my favorite wings of all time I love the hottest ones I eat lots of spicy food and these are the only that are both tasty and spicy Great beer selection I love the alligator stew and waffle fries especially Only problems with F F is how crowded it gets how loud it gets and that it s in Pittsburgh 
0IHnFKDZV17ApM1FuGYEpg CMU A nice option for a bite to eat at the park the cafe serves a nice range of salads sandwiches soups and pizzas and has a welcome number of vegetarian options The prices are quite reasonable for a museum tourist site cafe and the eating area is clean and welcoming They also use biodegradable cups and forks and compost their waste which is nice to see They also focus on organic local food Though my salad wasn t anything super special it was tasty enough and I d happily go back to support Phipps and its cafe 
0jEWGHLk8KHtUElet256lA CMU Bangkok Balcony has the BEST Yellow Curry I ve ever had in my life The END 
0KG85zj1wSkpjdP46yit1A CMU My wife and I went here and our overall feeling was meh We had the corn fritters and some kind of salad to start The former was bland and the latter consisted of spring mix from Giant Eagle with some added veggies For an entree we shared the tilapia which was beautifully prepared but not very tasty And it cost 20 for tilapia I can get 5lbs of the stuff for 20 at Whole Foods Anyway the atmosphere is nice and the staff were very friendly but for the price it s not worth it at all I can spend the same at say Dinette and get a MUCH better meal The truth is that we re really sad about this We love La Ferria in Shadyside and since we live i Squirrel Hill we were very excited to have something like it within walking distance Unfortunately it did not deliver I think we ll give them a few months to work things out and try it again If it s as bland then as it was now we ll be skipping this eatery 
0kwMdCCTXxfo3COcZ9tzmA CMU This place is ok and i haven t been here more than once But i ve given three stars for this place because my friend always goes there and collects fortune cookies for me I collect the fortunes so most of my papers were from Orient Express So do go here to get fortune cookies I ts close to CMU and its very cheap It s a good place to go to when you are really hungry and you want to save some money Saving is good after all Smriti 
0l1OqNI9ryRtrHTV2o3Rnw CMU The bartender at this bar was so incredibly rude to us that we left before ordering anything The fully story can be found here http livingaustria wordpress com 2011 12 01 phi stands for pub house of insolence I will NEVER return to this bar and HIGHLY recommend NOT going here to anyone else I would give this bar zero stars if that were possible 
0L9jtXV7oAOqwBhOEH_qzw CMU I can t believe the less than great reviews for Pamela s I also can t believe that I ve never reviewed this place before despite it being right around the corner from me Well I woke up yesterday with an appetite for a really good breakfast So borrowing an idea from a really good friend of mine I decided to take my guy out to eat Well he must have really had a great appetite himself because he ordered the bannana walnut pancakes Carbs Calories Fat Mmmm just thinking about that Pump that insulin Susan Pump Well I am a type 1 diabetic and even though I opted for the slightly less carb a lish ous pancakes and an egg on the side I still was pumping that insulin cos their cakes are s o o o o good The menu even bills them as The Devil s Carb Corner Hey a girl can t eat just scrambled eggs all her life A couple of things though Pamela s does have a lunch menu but they don t serve these on Sunday Also the place is CASH ONLY so be sure to stop at the ATM beforehand 
0lmAGDDGwFSTCLtV9EzyfQ CMU The menu is on the wall and the food is prepared at the counter you order at All the seating is upstairs The staff was decently friendly and the place is clean but mostly stark The sushi is just okay and the wasabi tastes of cheap horseradish On the whole a worthy inexpensive place to get some sushi 
0luhcwW9NEjxcqMWMAgm5w CMU Do they have the best service no Is their food that great uhm it s ok I ve had a good Reuben sandwich I ve had ok pasta but is their French Strawberry pie with a thin layer of chocolate in the crust worth a pilgrimage that required me driving an hour one direction to get it in season YES it is that good Their carrot cake is also stupendous The raspberry chambord thing is my mother s favorite If they ever have lemon cheesecake when you re there it s phenomenal Dont expect to be dazzled by the menu or the service but getting French Strawberry pie in May is worth going to Gullifty s Honest it s worth it 
0lZqE6HKGw5JiEQrDCiORQ CMU Jimmy Johns is fast So fast that they forgot to put sprouts on my tuna sandwich Considering that was the primary reason I got said tuna salad sandwich I m pretty bummed The tuna salad itself is chunk light tuna not even whole albacore and has a pretty fishy taste to it I ll give em another try and hopefully bump this review up another star 
0mpgIfPs3OQli0hPYWhYeQ CMU Awesome place with some very unique dishes Everything is good but you gotta get the shrimp and grits for an appetizer 
0MRevFr0LghQNKyJ3PvHHg CMU Their food is just okay I ve tried several of their dishes and only like one My friend and I tried their almond and taro milk tea and they were terrible I don t think they used tea to make the milk TEA They taste like they mixed the taro almond powder with water 
0N35bh01Jlgc9FSyRRUb8Q CMU Rittes is a classic old style diner in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh It has great diner food and of course great breakfast It has been a well know sober up place for years 
0N8aOTds6tQkAAJDBOlRvg CMU been back a few times for dinner and it s quite good their spicy beef tendon is great 
0NCpycdpYkxuyrioaDUvOg CMU Maybe it s because I don t know my gelato but I thought this place was just A OK There was nothing memorable or special about the gelato or the creamery shop 
0NSx78XlZcUGsDnSglIl0A CMU It s probably dumb to review a chain fast food restaurant but I will do it anyway Such is my devotion to Yelp I like that this Chipotle has a parking lot it makes it much easier to satisfy our cravings for burrito deliciousness Every time I ve been here the staff has been very friendly It looked to me like their scoops of rice meat and salsa were a bit meager but I didn t say anything about it Largely because Chipotle can be pretty high calorie as it is I don t usually count these things but I did today for kicks and my burrito was 810 calories and I didn t even get sour cream But on the bright side they claim to use organic produce cows without hormones sustainably raised ingredients and you don t hear that often from a fast food joint The food always tastes fresh My burrito was a little colder than I d like it maybe they re all that way and I m just picky but I had to put it in the oven to bring it to a good temperature Nonetheless it was very tasty as always it being a chicken burrito with corn salsa and cheese omnomnom It s a lot of food and the price is right 
0O-CLcx8TnrXk7Brb7pQVA CMU Decent food nice space and attentive service Two in my party ordered the duck curry and both seemed to enjoy it Another ordered pad thai and I had the pineapple curry Mine was tasty but not at all spicy even though I requested a 7 10 spiciness We all ordered tom yum soup and I found it to be not nearly as good as I am used to eating elsewhere I also thought the rice to curry ratio was lacking and that the food was a bit overpriced Our waitress was very efficient My water glass was always full and it did not take long to receive our meal have leftovers wrapped or to settle the bill The space is pretty large and they have some pretty cool lights on the ceiling The bathroom was clean I would come back here for Thai food if in the area but I would stress that I want to feel the heat and would not order the soup again 
0piApcEwiNERyveWEgvoDg CMU Sunday nights after 9 are half price food and margaritas Saturdays between 6 8 are also half price food and margaritas The margaritas are loaded with booze but taste so good Lets just say if you re a lightweight you ll be tapping after 1 You can either get the regular margarita or one of the flavored one Or you can mix two flavors together which is also really good After 2 of the big ones you get a very healthy buzz going on 3 well you ll have a more than healthy buzz and a ridiculous sugar rush 4 haven t seen it yet The sugar usually gets to you first As for the food this is great Mexican food I usually get a burrito and piggy size it so they put double the meat in I really don t need to get double meat because the serving sizes are enormous but after doing it the first time I can t possibly go back Mad Mex is one of the reasons why a lot of people get the freshman 15 and the sophomore 30 The food and drinks are soo good that you can t just say no There usually is quite a bit of a wait if you go for half price food but it s still worth the wait You can hang out at the bar and grab some free nachos and salso to go with a margarita while you wait for your food Definitely worth hitting up 
0QtTVEkLjPOu4XmB9KYxWQ CMU Disappointed in quality of overall meal the meats and breads were OK The pierogies were NOT good too doughy and greasy 
0r6mmARKN2_duxeGfumjUQ CMU Murray Ave Grill is essentially the only American restaurant in Sq Hill so they ve got you cornered if you just want a steak or salad The space isn t bad but they play 50 s music which just doesn t go with anything in there The service is usually nice and attentive They ve got a decent beer selection and the drinks flow until 2am When the weather s nice there s outdoor seating and they also have Sunday brunch 
0RFOneh7DBVilFoHl0nFvw CMU The only reason that I am giving this restaurant 2 stars is for the atmosphere location and idea This is one of those places that survive solely on sight The restaurant itself is very nice and located right next to the park I love love love the porch theme and atmosphere except it can be noisy Now the food on the other has a lot to be desired Eat n Park needs to evaluate what type of food that the offerings should be here They can not continue to venture into other types of dining while continuing to do the same old foods Just because it has a fancy name is isn t fancy I had the Grilled Farm Bread Sandwich Fried Egg house cured pork belly Vermont Cheddar Crispy Taters this basically equated to a bacon scrambler with over easy eggs cheddar cheese on Italian Bread which is something like 6 99 at eat n park compared to 9 00 here That is not upscale a nice plate with a nicer atmosphere has to have better food My wife had the RUSTIC BREAD SALAD Grilled Sourdough Bread Cherry Tomatoes Fresh Mozzarella Fris e Radicchio Housemade Coppa Basil Pesto the bread was burnt leaving an aftertaste and the basil pesto sauce was awful For 11 00 I expect a lot more Eat n Park got the decor location and atmosphere correct but they need to think outside the box when it comes to the food We really wanted to like this place 
0sAq-zGUEENirAJ83xtEcQ CMU The service here was very friendly and our food was delivered quickly We really like the large portion sizes and the relaxed and quiet atmosphere I didn t read other reviews before I went so I was a bit surprised to see all of the Peruvian craft and jewelry items for sale in the same space as the restaurant seating but I thought it was all beautiful and only added to the nice cafe atmosphere Not really a Friday night date destination but definitely a good place to get a bite to eat 
0sXb49DJSReNwDXkW0MXMg CMU I went to school at CMU and while I was there everyone seemed to love this place but I never got too into it Its best feature is that after 10pm you can get a 22oz Margarita for 7 which is probably the cheapest way to get yourself on the way to a good evening at a bar in Pittsburgh The margaritas themselves are nothing too special however people who are on their second may say differently this includes me The food is fine but nothing special and the place is extremely loud crowed and dark It takes a while to get a table and even if you just want to stand at the bar it is often hard to find a good spot Also for college students there is the added irritation that they enforce a rule that if anyone at the table is under 21 then nobody can drink unless you have somebody over 25 
0tj0V5klVZtWOvWCbR5llg CMU Ya Can t go wrong with this place tis a Pittsburgh pastime 
0TkJ4SpFbtjxFxyCT5olFA CMU Pad thai can be spicy 
0tL3g0AinFjD0IyMz1xG6Q CMU one of the best places for breakfast ever It gets packed every weekend with students parents and locals alike don t be afraid to put your name in and wait the little bit to get an amazing breakfast the interior is pretty festive with old school board games all over the walls and ceiling Has some of the standards of breakfast such as pancakes hotcakes eggs omelets etc but also has their spin on it this is a cash only restaurant so make sure that you have plenty of cash in order to pay for this meal I really liked the western style omelet that i got which had chorizo sausage in it so good 
0UruiMYPh_FEurypI7pK4w CMU It is rare for me to really rate chain stores but this is an experience to avoid if possible it is only an alternative to Chipotle if the line at Chipotle is incredibly long you re on a terrible time crunch and there s no parking at Chipotle In other words it s a terrible terrible replacement to Chipotle The concept may seem very similar to Chipotle but do not be fooled by the Spanish esque name At 5 p m on a Monday night Chipotle is already buzzing with the dinner rush but here at Qdoba there are only two tables occupied I believe that the menu tries to compete with Chipotle by having more variety and options but I think that the lack of focus contributes to a lack of quality in the food At this particular location these were some of the issues 1 When you get to the food display to place your order the food does not look fresh This of course is a concern because it may be the case that the food has been sitting out for hours which could result in some food poisoning 2 For a Mexican grill the food does not appear authentic At least a Chipotle the pico de gallo at least has a balanced portion of tomates onions and cilantro At Qdoba it just looked like diced tomatoes 3 The flavors are off When the food is all put together it tastes not like how a taco burrito should be 4 The area in which customers orders are assembled is not clean Food bits are everywhere At Chipotle it s almost spotless Overall you should just go to Chipotle instead 
0uTiACce_DHSxu06gVxc_w CMU I went to Pizzutti s with my mom and was really happy with the whole experience I ordered some sort of fettuccine pesto dish that was excellent and my mom ordered a fish dish They seemed to have a good spread of authentic ish Italian dishes this is no Buca di Beppo One thing I was not prepared for was how upscale it was I felt under dressed wearing a nice blouse and jeans It was also VERY quiet we went in at 5 and I felt like I was eating in library until some other patrons came in around 5 30 This seems like it would be a fantastic place for a date if you were willing to shell out the cash They don t serve alcohol although I believe that you can BYO without a corkage fee If you re not picky about your wine selection they do have both a house red and white that they offer you free of charge I liked the house white and thought it complemented my pasta well but I don t know much about wine Our waiter was really nice and made sure to tell us all the details about the dishes and which ones he liked He was even patient with my mom when she asked him which dishes on the menu had fresh vs dried pasta One last note they do not accept credit cards but they have an ATM in the restaurant Very strange 
0vam5ljHJZKSOWOaBbGMsQ CMU As soon as the new store opens my husband and I will be there ASAP Best gelato better than ice cream and so SO many good flavors I nearly had an emotional breakdown right on Copeland when I saw they had vacated their previous location I thought they were gone for good So happy to find out they are just moving 
0VCP1GbNFWbmyc7m-BDOlg CMU Not the best pizza in the world it s also not the worst but at 5 why complain 
0VzrRR7dsDfmakTHLw4xtA CMU If you re looking for a late night greasy fried food fix this is the place to come sadly I live a mere minutes distance from this place Their kitchen is usually open until 3 30am and if I ve been out in shadyside I often come here for a slice of pizza on my walk home They also have six packs for carry out which is useful sometimes Last time i went with a group of friends we tried one of their hugee calzones jalepeno poppers and the wings Its a really small place and their bar seems to never be really busy like shady grove or marios but it is a chill place to just get good bar food I always crave their pizza and chicken tenders yum 
0wMiKzzENVBvMvgs_2GrjA CMU Nothing too fancy if you re looking for something easy and casual this is a good place Outdoor seating is a plus Nice selection of beer and you can make your own pizza there is even a wheat crust option Pizza is cheap 20 for a large which can serve 3 4 people There are sandwich options too though I did not order one Waitress was sweet and got the job done Thumbs up 
0xazGXUh6mOMYX-O1H3TNQ CMU to me this is my favorite grocery store in pittsburgh plus shopping there gets ya discounts on fuel which helps alot nowadays from flowers to fresh sushi it has it all a good meat selection with a ton of variety in the case olive bar fresh fish a ton of vegetables huge selections of cheeses and prepared foods as well not to many people there at night time makes it easier to shop quickly but also means all of the departments with cases are closed free samples most days as well and a chef that cooks up something and has the recipe next to the food and you get to sample it all and all i love this giant eagle 
0XgY9oQSl0heg0CS2sLlyA CMU This is actually an outpost of Sree s restaurant in Squirrel Hill Despite the somewhat low rent appearance of the trailer the food is actually really good I would generally recommend the veg lunch but only because those dishes are delicious If you need meat they also have pretty good chicken even though it s all white meat My only complaint is their chutney but that s because I happen to really like mango chutney And yes the bread truly sucks fortunately there s more than enough food as it is Sree did have a a white guy serving up food at some point but so what I don t see why you need to be an ethnic to serve ethnic food In any case I m pretty sure he wasn t the cook The last time I was there it was a nice Indian lady short enough to fit into the trailer All in all I ve found this to be really nice place to get decent South Indian food not that far off from what you might find on the sub continent and not the fancy stuff you end up with in a restaurant in this area Check it out 
0YnMEx3SkPU490WbQoBFBg CMU Had the reuben which was good and big enough for two Will try the veal parmagian sandwich next time 
0Z4DIDSQ0Z6eOK5-JoOo6w CMU Came here a lot during my CMU days Good beer selection and yummy pizzas and there s a half off menu after 11pm 
0_5WV5dagGSRjqNHQXvfSw CMU Burger quest continues I had heard a lot of good things about Five Guys Hearing good things about a fast food joint is always surprising The final verdict Perhaps a slight notch up from McD s or Burger King The fries were actually very good I love crispy fries that haven t been sitting there for hours or days and they were high on the crispy o meter Plus the single helping was ginormous Enough for two people fo sho On the burger side meh I ordered what I thought was a regular cheeseburger Thankfully the chick at the register told me their regular is actually a double patty Um this truly is an influence of American culture super sizing Ok I m getting off my box now I opted for the single patty which was the little hamburger Little normal portion Keep that in mind when ordering The burger itself was ok Definitely not life changing And believe me I ve had myself a life changing burger in the burgh Cough cough Wingharts cough cough So if McDonald s and Five Guys were the last Fast Food restaurants on earth I would go with Five Guys Not saying much right 
10WN186BwrSHW3kqyiUmpw CMU If you re a college student in Pittsburgh odds are at some point or another you ve been here for dessert I will say on a college budget you get a lot of good reasonably priced food here Can it compete with the best of NYC no of course not but that isn t where you are is it Get a reuben and chase it down with a piece of cheesecake Go home happy Quit whining about how Pittsburgh isn t NYC 
12YOCJb0zuKue-F7ysHGSg CMU This place started out being great but it seems that every time I go there the food gets more expensive and the margaritas get weaker It s a really popular place but I am not on the bandwagon 
14ElTxIaRhNURQOWg2foFg CMU Ever think back to your early 20s You know when you were single and had your first apartment When you did your own budgeting and your own grocery shopping for the first time Ever look back at the neighborhood you lived in the places you went Me I lived in Greenfield from the time I was 23 up til I got married at age 27 I used to satisfy my pizza cravings here and I remember it being great pizza at an absolutely hole in the wall place I m proud to say it hasn t changed a bit Rick and I just wanted some takeout for dinner and since I was looking back at some of my old reviews I thought we d check out Conicella once again M m m m Greasy yummy bad for you pizza We ordered the white pizza with sausage hot peppers mushrooms on it Terrific Especially if you re like me and you fold your slice as you eat it I know my Chicago friends are cringing at the thought of eating it that way 
15R57_1QuueA_8pDBwOfhQ CMU Love the pie though I m a little under impressed with the white pizza Like that they offer other food besides pizza And not to mention you can grab a 6 pack 
15xPmIdSnhdB0paD5SoZJQ CMU Excellent place for a quick cheap lunch Menu is full of cheap eats and healthful fare can be found here too I ve twice had lunch there for two for under 15 The lentil soup and tabbouleh salad are great In and out in 30 45 mins easy Tight seating though most tables are for two 
16qhn2sP4A5Dkfi82v9hFw CMU I travel to Pittsburgh pretty often and the owner who cooks the crepes recognizes my wife and me every single time we re there The crepes are excellent the prices are more than reasonable and as long as you don t go there during a peak period it s never too crowded 
17gouKU9t0NN4Se2HcK5Qg CMU I find it amusing that my very first taste of Indian food was when I was 23 years old and in Pittsburgh of all places But I couldn t have picked a better place to pop that cherry because the first thing I noticed when I wandered into India Garden for lunch one day was all the accolades posted on the wall I ve been here for the lunch buffet several times and while I don t know from authentic when it comes to Indian food I know that I loved it and I ve been enamored with Indian cuisine ever since 
181oX3k6Og2LLgLCxwhG6Q CMU I went to Legume for the first time a few weeks ago The atmosphere service and food were excellent We made a reservation for a Friday night The food is very fresh local and best of all delicious When eating the first bites of my food I paused to enjoy all of the flavors Also bring a bottle of your favorite wine 
18G6h_sQuoAf7nOV-Sw1wg CMU This food was g ross We got a meatball sub cold no sauce salty minimal meat meatballs sliced in half that was dry and tasted bad as opposed to the preferable option of tasteless the Chicken Ranchero was a mess of mushroom no lettuce tomato ranch or bacon AND it had sweet peppers on it In short it was the wrong sub Ordered online so I don t know how they got the wrong order YIKES do not order from here This place makes Subway look like a five star restaurant Go there instead eat fresh AND we just found out they sent us the wrong sub Instead of rectifying it the manager hung up on us stating they didn t have time to deal with it Probably because of all the other wrong orders 
18vszhYmPbCyWw6LQT83-g CMU Excellent sushi overall one of the two best Japanese restaurants I ve ever been to Not that I m a huge Japanophile but I thought their salad and fried chicken were incredible and I know this is patronizing but I appreciated being in a Japanese place that s run by actual Japanese Dining room is extremely cozy meaning very small so I wouldn t hit it if I want an intimate dinner but it s a great place for a casual meal with awesome food I ll be back soon for non sushi dinner and I m highly confident that it will be good 
18_EAQu2-g64xkr4kW-EEg CMU I ve only been there once so take this for what it s worth I was in Squirrel Hill yesterday looking for a place to grab a bite to eat and saw this spot They had a veggie portabella sub which caught my eye I m an omnivore but was feeling like having something a little less heavy than the meat options so I opted for this sandwich Big mistake This portabella sandwich with provolone tasted more like Chinese food on a roll than anything close to an Italian sandwich The mushrooms were fried in way too much corn oil fully saturating the bread to the point where it couldn t be held together as a sandwich The provolone cheese was very low quality pretty much tasteless and did nothing for me I find that often sandwich shops will have a vegetarian option just for the purpose of offering herbivores something edible while their friends enjoy the real menu The fact that a sandwich lacks meat shouldn t have to mean that it lacks flavor If you guys are knowingly making vegetarian sandwiches that you wouldn t eat that s not a symptom of them being veggie sandwiches but a demonstration of your lack of willingness to take the time to figure out how to make a tasty veggie option Figure it out 
195SH5gu1mxXJXnRRhs0uA CMU I don t think I would ever go back here It was quite overpriced and the food was strikingly bland Also if you re a caucasian chef don t try to serve Asian dishes unless you have a clue It s effing embarrassing My risotto was ZzZzZzZzzzzzzzzzzzzz How hard is it to make good risotto ya dummy 
19TAsvgGboX_c_ZsxnxAmQ CMU i asked the chef to create something vegetarian since I didn t see alot of items on the menu It was fantastic Jalapeno risotto with greens and some other items I was very impressed and will return Upscale but relaxed loved it 
1A0qYIIXOOHmc5dTMXl4_w CMU After previous bad experiences at Red Oak I d stopped going there for a few months Today I decided to give them a second try hoping maybe the staff had changed over enough for them to have improved Boy was I wrong I ordered 2 salads both of which came with old lettuce a few pieces of romaine were red throughout the stem and mine had a few rotten tomatoes one was black for half of it The final straw While eating his Ceasar salad my friend cut his mouth on a sharp hard piece of plastic I called before walking back to the store and the guy on the phone said they would be willing to make things better When I got back to the restaurant the manager walked up pulled 7 out of the drawer threw it at me and said have a good day without even asking me what was actually wrong or trying to see what the problem was My question to Red Oak after reading all the bad reviews here How do you expect to make things better if you won t even listen to what is wrong 
1a5FOyJHhN34K0xtj5KP8A CMU There is a reason this restaurant has over 60 reviews It might not look like the greatest neighborhood but Great food at an affordable price The place was quite clean and droned a nice ambiance as well 
1AE3wCdGQ_xdWDB5m0aSqg CMU We went to The Porch recently for Sunday brunch Love the bright and open space We got a table towards in back along the banquet We were greeted right away by our super perky server For drinks BJ opted for a seasonal beer and I ordered a pineapple sage margarita I love this drink so good BJ ordered the chorizo eggs He thought it was okay But he really liked the fried potatoes I loved his meal I sampled I got the Rocket salad I loved the roasted beet and the Sherry vinaigrette I thought the chorizo was a little tough We decided to get the cookies for a sweet little treat We were told we would get 6 and we even got to pick what kind 3 peanut butter cookies and 3 white chocolate macadamia nut cranberry Somehow we only ended up with 5 We were missing one cookie We asked our server about our missing cookie and she couldn t come up with a satisfactory answer Kinda of a strange ending to an otherwise good meal 
1bGx71p0QqntqjuGzKngIg CMU Good homestyle American fare High quality ingredients well prepared Liked the new gourmet sides of loaded potatoes and Mediterranean green beans I think the quarter dark plate with 2 sides is pretty good especially if you use one of the free soft drink or 1 coupons in the paper or from their website Service was good and restaurant super clean when I went Oh yeah pretty cool to get real plates and silverware when dining in 
1bpRjrwpt-jgtf_XQKt5Ew CMU I love Reuben sandwiches Every new place I go I must try one Smallman s has one of the best Reuben s in Pittsburgh and maybe anywhere The rye bread is perfect and grilled to perfection on the grill with butter The corned beef I mean it is Smallman s so it gets no better than their deli cuts Finally the sandwich comes with the perfect amount of kraut and dressing a good Reuben can be ruined by too much of either of these ingredients Smallman s Reuben is not the largest you will find but will definitely be the best in terms of quality you can eat And it comes with a pickle Man do I love dill pickles and Smallman s is spectacular 
1CJzOfk4PAKlG1zzdIazFA CMU Tamarind is the most authentic Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh in the beautiful setting of a restored Victorian Manson Don t go in expecting your traditional Americanized Indian Fare the restaurant has a more limited menu that focuses on artfully prepared sauces The food quality is excellent with moderate portions The prices are fair but more expensive than other Indian in the city The decor is elegant and modern with nice views if only of Craig St Parking is very limited and the neighboring Centre Ave area doesn t attract the most savory characters 
1ctSJ6xh3c8Z11MXwlQFMQ CMU Mmm Pamela s picture me saying this with the Borat accent Their pancakes SO GOOD The wait to get in sometimes SO BAD That s literally the long and short of it I pine for their deliciously thin crispy and yet soft and chewy crepe like pancakes with the brown sugar sour cream strawberries and syrup MMmmmmm Great and caloric way to start your day It just kinda sucks when it s 20 degrees outside and you re half in the door half out because they don t really have a lobby or a ton of seating Gets borderline claustrophobic crowded in there sometimes so I couldn t really give it a 5 5 stars The Walnut St location suffers from the same problem too 
1cVwx9qVxwscPGkPWeHzTg CMU Everyone raves about the desserts here but I m not sure what the big deal is I was kind of grossed out by the food and the desserts were so so tasted like the fridge sad to say I cannot recommend Perhaps quality has declined over the years On the plus side there are giant photographs of vegetables on the walls 
1dyjkpwmAH6U8idk_73ADg CMU I started out really disliking the food at Silky s especially where there are better bar food options within a mile But they ve won me over A little bit I ll call them average Wings still underwhelmed They are a dry rub unless you get a bbq And usually overcooked I like my wings well done but these are always so average I don t even order them here anymore Burgers and Sandwiches are pretty good Buffalo chicken wrap was solid Burger off the special menu got the job done Waffle fries very good I think because they are very crispy Based on the bacon reviews below i think the general rule is they are good at frying the hell out of something sometimes for good sometimes for bad What redeems this place beyond the average food is the layout and outdoor seating It beats other bloomfield bars given it s greater amount of seating and better views of tv screens Also it has the most outdoor seating Not tons but if you get there at a decent hour still possible to get a table Silky s usually makes the list to watch a game or if weather calls for outdoor drinking 
1EB9Bn22baBV2qLRmxhoCw CMU Lulu s is a mediocre restaurant and it offers Japanese Chinese Korean and other Pan Asian cuisines Go to this restaurant if you want to take chances Sometimes the food comes out alright but there are other times when the food tastes like complete crap It also depends by the hours the food comes out slowly and unsatisfactory during lunch and dinner times However the food comes out faster and OK at random hours The only dish that I recommend is Thai Lemon Basil Beef with noodles Lulu s also serves bubble teas and my favorite ones are lychee flavored tea and mango smoothie with bubbles Although the food is okay I m not satisfied with the service The waitresses at Lulu s can be rude sometimes 
1ErTJk52fRW-5uAblAYoew CMU Cozy and comfortable our food was really good and the waitstaff friendly and efficient The mussels were great garlic madness and they split some entrees for us in the kitchen wowowow Will definitely try and revisit next time I m in Pittsburgh 
1EVEOAsghi8GnoSYqzdKVw CMU Good memories here Great Indian food late at night for college kids and I believe it was half off after a certain time The entrees can get pretty spicy so please exercise caution when ordering spiciness level If you want something filling try any of the biryanis There s a club either downstairs or next door that s thumping at that time so that might be why everything s half off 
1EWnxxhrlvYwmI7GH9pVsQ CMU This is the best authentic Japanese food you will find in Pittsburgh It s not a teppanyaki restaurant or a generic sushi bar Chaya has soba and udon nabe tonkatsu kaki fry hamachi and kampachi kama etc Great selection and good flavors You can take your Japanese friends collegues here and not feel embarassed 
1FePXjJNZFrib6fuxzOk6A CMU Wow I don t know what happened An old standby sort of let me down I decided to try to make a meal out of appetizers tapas if you re a Prius driver and I just didn t really enjoy it that much The taro spring rolls and the fancy crab rangoons were good if a bit small The chicken wrapped in pandanus leaves and the salmon dumplings were just not good at all The prices didn t match the portions or the quality either Silk Elephant I wanted to visit you one last time before leaving this town for hopefully ever and now I won t miss you anymore Mission accomplished 
1fQhAokBe-sW9RN0ZhbYPQ CMU First tried the place around 3 00 on a Sunday afternoon As we walked in a middle aged woman sat at a table next to the cash register She asked us Here or to go We said here She jerked her head to the left vaguely indicating the entire restaurant and said Sit down We wondered why she was so mad at us for coming into her restaurant We sat ordered and like we do at LuLu s got out or phones and magazines prepared to wait for a while The food came out almost immediately It was hot fast and absolutely delicious Steamed veggie dumplings were a bit bland but the dipping sauce was superb Mayalysian Satay Chicken was not a peanut sauce but a spicy red sauce Really good My Tofu Eggplant Fish Hot Pot a piping hot clay bowl filled with all of those things plus veggies was so good I didn t want it to end Luckily the portion was so huge I had enough for lunch the next day The Ginger Smoothie was made with real ginger so it had that fabulous bite Seriously good The next time we try this place we ll likely get take out since the service was so weird I won t go into boring details you ll see for yourself when you go there I m just saying the service is bad enough to make us not want to suffer through it again but not bad enough to cancel out the deliciousness of the food we definitely want to have again If the service had been friendly we d definitely have given this place 4 or 5 stars 
1FR8yOuZrCwHU8hlczYm-A CMU Normally I would at least give two stars but the service is horrendous I ve been twice and the food isn t any more or less memorable than Olive Garden Now I definitely love OG and unabashedly so but they refill your drinks salad breadsticks etc and they bring the CORRECT total for your check within 5 minutes of saying I d like my check now please D Amico s Place Not so much 
1gHnEafYTFLtsn47LxarVg CMU I would agree with a few other revieweres that Cappys is somewhere between a Cheers bar and a dive bar with character In a way it reminds me of that bar back home I live in Shadyside and every time I ve gone out I would say that I ve ended up at Cappys at some point maybe 30 of the time That s not too bad seeming how 54 of all stats are made up on the spot What set s Cappys apart from the other local bars is it s so small It s so small that I feel like I should know everyone there That is also a play on the atmosphere I feel like most people do know most people there Actually I may go back there tonight after writing this review I d like to reiterate the point of this review It s a bar it has alcohol It has food To me it s the atmosphere that really sells Cappys It may very well appeal to you and is worth a shot 
1gkBP-c7F7u8MmUEU_KwEg CMU Nice place attentive staff and good attention to detail in the kitchen We asked for a tasting menu with wine pairings and gave them no other guidance The meal they prepared was very appropriate in both the succession of flavors and the portion sizes Everything was very well prepared The wines were all very nice but the pairings could have been better It seemed like the person who was preparing the food menu and the person who prepared the wine listing didn t actually talk to each other I could have lived without the series of employees who came by to socialize with the couple at the table next to ours for most of the meal Having to look at someone s ass for an entire course at a time really takes away from the ambiance of a place Overall we were pleased by the meal and will go back sometime 
1gpBFsH9V4O_xiRCDFtTNQ CMU If it weren t for two friends who absolutely love Gullifty s and swear by their desert I would have only tried Gullifty s once It s not because Gullifty s is bad the desert is fine but I don t think it warrants the title of Best Desert in Pittsburgh Gullifty s is like an independent Eat N Park Portions are plentiful the atmosphere is comfortable and the food is average If that s what your e looking for this is the place to go 
1GsyAL_zCVyupPiy1wrhaQ CMU I go here whenever I make it back to Pittsburgh The Mango Pork Curry is the best writing this review makes me want to take a trip to Pitt so I can have some 
1h7FdnAWCkASd1KdNDd3qg CMU Nice and solid 3 5 stars for some solid AmericanItalian food Service was really really friendly and the portions were really generous It doesn t compare to your top rated traditional Italian joint because that s not what it is It s really more of an unpretentious mom and pop spot with consistent hearty meals Great stop for lunch or dinner and cozy family atmosphere We ate we laughed and had a very relaxed meal with coffee and dessert at the end Drinks were refilled seamlessly and leftovers carefully packaged Would definitely come by again 
1hE-GsUaX4RVXzpnAXtQNg CMU The sauces are amazing especially the mustard Pair that with brisket and the best coleslaw I ve ever had and I m a happy camper Their greens are not my favorite which is the only reason I d say 4 stars instead of 5 The owner and his wife are also incredibly nice and make a real effort to know their customers 
1hQFDM_BU1EpVoVCgvJ-Xw CMU I ve been coming here for over ten years Lulu s is Lulu s and it will never change but fortunately their Fried Tofu big plate hot and sour soup and crab rangoon have never changed and neither has my love of very unhealthy fried food if you come here for dinner the service is terrible but you ll get your food eventually if you come here for lunch your food will come out very quick and extremely hot and it may or may not arrive around the same time your dining companion s food arrives it s cheap it s greasy the spicy peanut noodle bowl is DELISH So is the fried tofu egg roll hot and sour soup crab rangoon curry and pad thai 
1i48bsHISdgLtaaB6cJKWw CMU Weird weird place I ve never been somewhere that made you feel so uncomfortable as a patron This was on a Friday night from 8 30 9 30 They close at 9 45 The sushi was good not spectacular The nice thing is that the rolls were cheaper and smaller in portion size so you could sample a few I also liked the selection of nigiri The attitude there from the menu warnings to the inclusion of a tip calculator with your bill is really weird When you open the menu you are confronted with a list of about 7 or 8 rules of engagement These range from a refusal to split a check to a line that says they occasionally at their discretion add in a 17 service charge not table occupancy related There were quite a few of these and it seem like an awful lot for a place that only seats about 25 It s BYOB yet they charge 2 for every wine or beer glass and then an extra 3 for chilling or ice They didn t open our wine but just left a bottle opener at the table The restaurant was fairly empty yet all the prime booths and the Sushi bar seats were demarcated as reserved We were the last people there and nobody ever came to claim the special seating They remained set and reserved until about 30 minutes before closing when they cleaned them off while we were eating The restaurant is almost eerily quiet except for the occasional whispering among the wait staff It seems like you aren t assigned any particular server as they all hover around your table waiting for you to want something When they aren t doing this they huddle in the corners and whisper to each other It s distracting with the lack of music Really weird place The final strangeness was that the bill is proffered in your typical black check book that contains a list of tip calculations in fluorescent green For a place that seems to average about 70 for two people with tip I don t think the weirdness is worth it 
1i4yPs9FISXxN_lZTfgWPA CMU I m a bit surprised the rating consensus isn t higher To me this is the quintessential college bar and one of the best meals in Oakland I love the Turkey Burger the beef is good too with their french fries and a tall glass of lemonade They have excellent drink prices and have some city fame for their wine specials However these deals also forced all these stipulations on the menu about loitering how long you can stay things amounts of you money you should spend etc That s a turn off The menu is simple but pleases all The inside and small outside seating areas are cozy I love going here a few times a year and I wish there was a steady twin in Philadelphia 
1i7SyIqa_bc59Cd5GpKQIg CMU The crepes here are good They are tasty and they have a variety However the crepes are extremely over price So over price that I cannot afford a drink Finally the staff is extremely rude and LOVES to make loud examples of people not familiar with their system I ve chosen never to eat here again due to the staff 
1IFA4KPya6jk4Oi_nhFfXQ CMU I m rather sad after two years of living in Pittsburgh I made my first visit to Alli Baba last night I must say I was very impressed The dinner menu includes around 10 entrees and 15 a la carte items Everything I sampled of my friends was very tasty well seasoned and very satisfying The hummus baba ghanooj salads and soups were all obviously made in house not too garlicky but had a good punch of acidity that I often miss in this type of fare If I was closer to Oakland I would frequent this place for lunch I feel like it is similar in quality to Istanbul for lunch but crushes Istanbul s Larryville location for dinner without question Beer only Wine is BYOB without a corkage from what I could tell Lastly Jenny I also had the Moussaka It was very tasty and if you think something like this or lasagna souffle etc is not going to be reheated from a big platter they made earlier that day you re fooling yourself 
1IvQwEcOuDqkG2_qwa4xGw CMU Aweful service Black obese man claiming to be the manager literally kicked us out of the store 10 minutes BEFORE the store was supposed to close He was rude thoughtless and should not be in the food service Will never go to this location again 
1jhNGAVjPe2xMEJSxE7f6Q CMU I m happy to have this Get Go near where I live Because we buy our groceries at Market District we end up saving a lot on gas here On our first visit we paid about a dollar a gallon because we accumulated savings without knowing it What a great deal It s nice to have an automated fast food ordering system First you punch in everything you want into the computer it prints out a receipt you pay for it at the registers and they have it ready Today I tried their build your own burger for 3 99 There s a lot of options to put into your burger I prefer these to Five Guys Almost every visit I pick up a DVD from the RedBox Such a convenient little store One major downside is that you can t get cashback on your debit card 
1jTYX5EVJS9YtO_bOPEong CMU This is a solid contemporary neighborhood bistro I liked Avenue B for its frequently changing menu with up to date dishes that appeal to current palates fresh ingredients competent kitchen overall the food is pretty good competent front staff friendly hostess helpful wait staff comfortable ambiance pricing comparing to other restaurants of its type not too expensive Why it s not a 5 star While the kitchen does have the basics down they won t overcook the meat for example not every component of every dish works I do appreciate that they are at least trying to put together interesting flavors but sometimes the combination is just off Of what I ve sampled there I d rate the dishes in the B range they are far from a disaster but none was a hit out of the park winner Recently a friend walked into Salt of the Earth and confused it with Avenue B because of the oversized chalkboards I thought the two restaurants make an interesting comparison I d give the food nod to Salt but I probably would visit AveB more frequently because it is a more comfortable dining experience overall 
1LLHtWUjE4M6JjFdNxlokg CMU Average american style chinese food with fair prices and extremely quick preparation The location is a bit questionable as it is in a basement It is usually filled with college students but you will occassionally find an older individual working on a 40 while watching television Tawain Cafe s charm comes from the waiter bus boy who tries to make it a more personal experience 
1M-4dN-5jx1s0OuJavybVA CMU One day a man had a dream Probably not an inspiring I have a dream kind of dream but more likely a poorly understood collection of images viewed while unconscious and only vaguely remembered At any rate this man woke up one day from his slumber and said Hey I like Qdoba and Chipotle but instead of burritos could I customize rolls of extremely inauthentic sushi from limited options And make sure it s mostly rice BAM Sushi Fuku was born So pick a protein some add ons a sauce and a type of rice and throw it all together in a bowl or a roll yes it rhymes and yes you can t walk 2 feet in the place without being reminded of it It s not bad but once the limited novelty wears off that s about all you can say of the place It s sushi fast food and though I felt it was a little overpriced though admittedly each roll is quite large I ll probably wind up back here Especially if the line is longer at Chipotle 
1M4xhr1eok9N1Kf6oQl_0Q CMU A true French Brasserie experience I KU went there last evening for an impromptu dinner date We were warmly greeted in French at the door The owner himself is quite a character a true Frenchman of the North He s a tad boisterous but he made our experience overall a good one He gave great recommendations and also entertained the children that were sitting next to us with various magic trips The staff that he has hired is knowledgeable not only in French cuisines but in French as well We were served water along with slices of baguette and butter The baguette was good not great I ve had better La Gourmandine Paris of course For an appetizer we ordered warm tarts that were filled with brie and caramelized onions which melted in our mouth It was served alongside a mixed green salad with a tangy dressing that had a nice bite For our main entrees I ordered a very traditional Brasserie meal Poulet r ti et frites which also came with asparagus It was very simple but extremely delicious My KU ordered one of the night s specials leg of lamb that quite literally fell off the bone It was served alongside scalloped potatoes and asparagus We asked for a wine recommendation that went well with lamb and was served a delightfully light red The owner has put together a small but very delicious wine list We topped the night off with what else but Cr me br l e A wonderful truly authentic French Brasserie a must try 
1McP5CGQN2A8zJzMg8ec4Q CMU Hey super savers Food shots candy necklaces Cheap slim vundabar bar is not German b 
1MZOSz6xUFmb7mRBa8VhXw CMU What a fantastic breakfast Service is good and the food is outstanding Parking can be tricky but with a fun neighborhood like this who cares I ll go back here again ASAP 
1OICyYQWc0WBPDQ39Jrjyw CMU It s an entire enterprise centered on salads customized and created right in front of you And that s enough alliteration for one review The value proposition is VERY simple If you want a salad and you want to have a lot of control over what goes into it chosen from a variety of options then go here If you want anything else in the world don t go here they have other menu items but nothing that can t be beat elsewhere I will give a special mention of their beverage selection Pretty good unsweetened iced tea sits next to a fountain with multiple Boylan brand whoops sodas Better than your normal soft drink offerings Oh and because you have to basically go down the counter with someone as he or she makes your salad I think it would be a hard place to go with groups since there will be substantial lag in between the times the first and last people receive their salads though it s not as big a problem as it would be at other restaurants since you don t have to worry about your salad getting cold 
1oj8L38TXGSwJbuo34xpIw CMU I like thisSquill location better cuz they have sweet potato fries Still my 2nd fav cheesesteak place ever 1st place belongs to del amo steakhouse in torrance it s really really good with provolone and not the yellow slimy stuff I really miss this place Definitely tastes better when you eat it on the spot but even to go is still great 
1QbZMh8JQF97nd-_Rw7l-g CMU Quality of food and the prices were good Our only complaint was that they ran out of seafood pancakes Silky Tofu was very good It s not very easy to find We would go back 
1QmLj-Z4IxTEWEEBhpunUA CMU I love it here and I try and introduce it to as many people as possible They have great lunch specials meal egg roll and soup and they aren t typically crowded so you can get in and out pretty quickly Both my parents aren t big fans of Chinese food and I think most people associate Thai food with Chinese Not the case There are some similarities but I love the flavors and sauces used in Thai and the vegetables always seem so much more fresh Needless to say my parents love it here now I always order the spicy chicken and opt for spicing of 5 scale of 1 to 10 I ve gone up on the scale to 7 and my eyes and nose were watering I love how flavorful the food is and you get an ample food for the price I ve ordered the spring rolls or the corn fritters as an appetizer and they are very tasty and the sauce that accompanies them is perfect although it is a sweet sauce The Pad Thai also gets goods reviews from friends I ve taken The place is clean and the service is attentive Stop by and give it a try if you re in the Shadyside area And on the bonus side it s right across the street from Mercurio s so you can swing by for some gelatto afterwards 
1qR6mwoWM8jmghBa3smysA CMU The chef really makes some challenging dishes The dishes incorporated seasonal local produce we had ramps All the menu choices are posted on the giant chalkboard and you get choices of sides The restuarant is small and seating area is very tight but acceptable If you are looking for a contemporary menu that incorporates all many types of cuisine look no further and bring a bottle of vino 
1rfHd23NOcVYEivCgGlcuQ CMU In my sizable experience the worse a hole in the wall a BBQ Pit is the more finger lickingly delicious their food is T K s is no exception The decor atmosphere and service are not going to win any awards but the soul food is as good as it gets the prices are extremely reasonable it was 10 for my meal and they gave me a ton of ribs I got the pork ribs with 1 2 honey mustard sauce and 1 2 hot sauce and a side of mashed potatoes and greens The sides were savory rich and fresh and the ribs were some of the best I ve ever had I d go back in a heart beat but plan on getting the food and taking it to go for a summer picnic dinner 
1s0NtLIsRrdMJLwFw-H6xQ CMU The chef here won t ever be in the running for a Michelin Star or a James Beard Award but Orient Express has some extremely reliable strengths 1 The service is FAST Not necessarily stellar or friendly but fast They take your order and bring the food out extremely quickly 2 The food is cheap It s hard to feel ripped off especially given the amazing convenience 3 The experience is consistent They ll get you to your meeting class nap on time and the food is reliably just below average But sometimes that s just what hits the spot especially when it fits the schedule and budget as well If you re looking for a date night place fine dining or something absolutely unique or delicious look elsewhere But Orient Express certainly has its advantages 
1S57ifJbQ-rb2e1RwX_G5Q CMU The margaritas and chicken wings are great The place is really loud sometimes and the rest of food is just OK The corn bread used to be better but somewhere a long the way they changed it and its not as good nowadays 
1S7h6JvHk_0K2wJ9-7Sdmw CMU Primanti Bros is a unique and solid Pittsburgh delicacy Not only was my sandwich tasty the sandwich itself could have fed three of me Boyfriend had the pimanti cheesesteak which isn t actually a cheesesteak I had the salami sandwich but forgot to ask for cheese It was still good If I lived here I would take visitors here for a taste of local flavor but the sandwiches aren t exactly my dish it s too much food and not easily kept as left overs 
1sNEF-LX09PWf5AehiO09w CMU 4 stars for Pittsburgh Competent service good drinks I don t love the theme ed ness or for that matter the food But they have lots of great specials and the California salad with lime cilantro dressing is one of the best salads in the Burgh If you don t like the noise go for lunch especially a weekend lunch or early dinner Other locations are fine too FYI vegetarians the dressing has cheese in it And it s so good I bet it s actually real parmigiano reggiano too or close to it 
1SoiIiKx1M7VGZ2JDzeH6A CMU I really wanted to give this a great review because I have very fond memories of this place when I was a kid with my mom and also when I was in my early 20 s hitting this place after 3 AM Alas I went there this morning and found out it really is just your typical greek diner with a giant menu I give it kudos for the jukebox on the tables Sopranos finale style and I thought our server was great She easily had been doing this for 40 years The atmosphere is good just like any other diner you would go too I was here this morning with my friend Fiona and we both needed a hearty breakfast to help with our recovery from the prior night The coffee was good and plentiful We never had less than half a cup I had two poached eggs and white toast The eggs were poached perfectly and the bread was appropriately soaked with butter All in all this was pretty good My bacon was also fine with three healthy strips However Fiona was less lucky She had a veggie omelette which was average at best size doesn t matter with respect to omelettes I d rather less eggs but super beaten so the omelette is light The veggies were plentiful but I d prefer the veggies lightly sauteed so texturely there isn t such a difference from the eggs to the vegetables The sausage was good but cold She asked for crispy bacon and it wasn t crispy at all in fact it was exactly the same doneness as mine The homefries were okay but I prefer a little more crust on the potatoes I d say this is a perfectly acceptable diner but I d recommend you ll enjoy your meal much better if it s at 2 AM in the morning as opposed to 10 AM on a saturday when most of your whits are about you and your palate is not dulled from the Tequila 
1T7uBGauBzn1QJi6ymNFNw CMU Went on a Saturday with my gf She had pad thai and it was average nothing special I had beef w brown sauce w snow peas and shrooms The brown sauce tasted like dishwater with a hint of sesame Not sure why all the rave reviews here there has got to be better Thai in the burgh 
1WMzRZSTLCZdkmr0eibMPA CMU I m seriously confused at why people hate on this place so much Maybe the service food can be iffy at times but today it was great I hadn t been here in a really long time so I felt like I had to try the food again to write a proper review We got the best seat in the house according to the host That actually means the seat by the window so you can people watch Everything looks good on the menu so I opted for a little bit of everything I started with the cauliflower soup I didn t know what to expect but it came as pureed with a cheesy taste to it It was amazing I asked the server what was in it and she said it was cream cheese Mystery solved cream cheese makes everything better I also tried the beat salad I loved the fact that there was golden and red beets in it I just wish there were more although I always feel that way about beet salads at restaurants it seems The main course was the Walnut Crusted Salmon with Bread Pudding and Apple Buerre Blanc It was really tasty The salmon was cooked perfectly which meant not over cooked at all and the bread pudding apple buerre was really delish Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive and I really couldn t ask for a better meal I ve been won over and I d definitely go back and try ten things again 
1X0KmCLzYRFcJaKgSpMocg CMU Yes I know it s a huge chain Yes they only serve burritos But I had a friend in from out of town who d never eaten at a Chipotle because friends told him it was mediocre This is the best fast food restaurant I know Five stars I have never had food this fast cheap tasty in any form that was repeatable If you re not eating the vegetarian options the carnitas pork pinto beans is hands down the best combination 
1X2U8zgSijgmbal8NDRJSg CMU I came here for the pizza the other night as I ve heard other friends raving about it I was a bit skeptical that a gelato place could make good pizza but I was proven wrong I ordered the Pizza del Re which sounded absolutely splendid Truffle oil mushrooms fresh mozzarella and prosciutto di parma As I suspected it was pretty friggin amazing The prosciutto and the truffle oil made it stand out though It was such a wonderful medley of flavor The only reason I couldn t give this place 5 stars was the crust It got kind of soggy and reminded me more of a pita rather than pizza crust It was OK but definitely could be improved However I can t wait to try some of their other pizza options This definitely has become one of my favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh 
1XbUFlwbsPcSInKuF_LS1g CMU I grabbed a quick steak quesadilla for 6 on special and it was loaded with steak peppers and cheese It basically hit the spot It looks like they have a good beer selection and drink specials as well 
1xR74z3x37_dVGro_WIV3Q CMU Maybe it is for sentimental reasons that I need to give the Oakland location 5 stars but it it also because even though I have been coming here for 16 years God that is creepy I love it each and every time I have never had bad service here whether they are busy or not the bartenders and servers are always attentive and make sure your drinks are always full and replenished The dark ambiance creates a mystery about the place and I am not sure if I would want to see it all lit up after all of these years anyway It can be loud from time to time but seating is always quite intimate so you can hear whomever you are with Chips and salsa are yum fish or chicken tacos are always yum and of course the margaritas are always yum I yearn for the Apple Cider Margarita often because it is only seasonal The Gobblerito is a must have in November as well I will continue to patronize this location even though I am many years removed from my years in South Oakland Keep up the fab work 
1YG4-mEbU2PBL-Xca6Xf8Q CMU I was looking for a casual ish place to entertain business partners The parameters decent bar options food for picky eaters dieters as well as the slightly adventurous and not about the break the bank I walked away from a fairly decadent meal for about 30 a head including tip and tax Not bad Not bad at all Location great neighborhood for those who know it right by Pitt CMU and the Carnegie institute Street parking can be a bit of a pain And don t try finding the restaurant on your GPS it s technically in a park but it s visible from Forbes Street If you re doing an event here for folks out of town be sure to give good directions about travel and parking Appetizers I ordered plates of meat and vegetarian antipasti for the table with two cornbread skillets The food was appropriate for our table and there were small plates already out but why no serving utensils Also the cornbread skillet is somewhat awkwardly sized it s way too big buttery and dense for one person too large to be romantic for two probably more appropriate for four people to share but it feels small I don t know I would almost prefer it if they did single serve cornbread pieces that were a third the size of the cornbread dishes Entrees I was quite pleased with my scallops well seasoned kind of unexpected combination with roasted pumpkins I believe and my table mates seemed pleased with their pizza nice presentation on the pizza and their hamburgers and veggie burger Atmosphere mostly a young adult crowd kind of felt like a fresh twist on a diner Modern decor I found fitting great park views but the MUSIC Top 40 s dreck playing a bit too loudly for my taste If I m back in the area I ll definitely consider doing another meal here but as far as I m concerned this is not a place I ll go out of my way to visit again 
1yqUIq6eQekQWmQjxVjmAQ CMU Terrible preparation was sloppy taste was mediocre Sushi rolls fell apart 
1YY8lUPhsGX9ws1lmjcgPg CMU These hotcakes crepe pancakes are to die for I just had the blueberry hotcakes this morning and I almost creamed my pants I obviously couldn t finish the whole thing or else I d be in a food coma or turn diabetic from the rich brown sugar embedded between the layers or cream butter and magic but it was one of the best breakfast pancakes crepe variations I ve ever had This is actually quite a big deal to me because I ve had classic Paris crepes with Nutella and this is up there on the omg you have to try it scale The quirky diner scene with checkered tables was a nice addition and the staff is rather friendly Apparently this place is crowded for brunch on weekends but going on an overcast Tuesday morning at 9 seemed to work out well Anyway if you re in Pittsburgh you must try this place For Shame if you have not 
1Z-mLi9s_fnpwCjLPe4Eew CMU It was a warm early summer night and Annie surprised me with reservations for this charming little bistro that I have been meaning to visit since it s opening but for whatever reason just kept missing the opportunity However after chatting with the chef at the restaurant party I d renewed my urgency for visiting The restaurant is located on s braddock ave in regent square I used to spend more time here back when a friend lived near and its added a few good spots since D s six pags and dogz for example but I ll save that review for another time This is a nice area for date night with a few places for casual fine dining independant flick at Regent square theater or shopping then pool and guiness at one of the local irish pubs Legume offers outdoor dining which is great especially when their is good people watching like there is here We weren t able to sit outside but got a fine table in the intimate and dimly lit dining room It is a small place and unfortunately we were seated a little too close to some guy going on and on about hedge funds so it was a little too close for comfort I think there is like 8 or 10 tables mostly 4 tops The floors are hardwood and I like some of the details of the space itself such as the fixtures and art These folks also get the details as I noticed with the silverware they were using I think Toast uses the same type of simple ornate silverware A couple other non food details It s byob for a small corkage fee of 3 Many other spots charge 10 You can feel comfy in Jeans flip flops or a suit and I noticed all forms of attire and all ages These folks are totally ingredient driven and I m sure are into the whole farm to table movement and sustainability They change most of the menu daily and use top quality ingredients and often serve traditional fare with a contemporary flair Okay onto the food We started with some good quality crusty bread and delicious room temperature high quality butter Our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive I started with the tuna tartar It was a nice portion of sushi grade tuna with perhaps a citrus or some type of acid used to cut the richness of the fish It was okay I mean it didn t blow me away but was perfectly acceptable However I have to admit I ve had tuna tartare that seemed to have a more crisp or bright flavor if you will at other places Again it was fine just not 5 stars Annie tried the Buttermilk soup with bulger chickpeas and parsley Unfortunately Annie didn t know it was served cold and that would have been a non starter for her before go I tasted it and not really being a fan of cold soup it wasn t my thing either I get what he was going for I think It was rich while also not seeming to be too heavy It had a very layered flavor and I noticed many different spices most notably curry I had the steak for my entree and I think it was served with mashed potatoes It was cooked perfectly delicious and flavorful The mashed potatoes were also really good I don t think I want to know how much cream and butter is used For me the steak was the first thing I had that I really liked here Annie had their famous Chicken cooked under a skillet with garlic and mashed potatoes I really enjoyed this also and see why it is so popular The chicken was moist and I prefer this than to just boring chicken breast The skin was great and the mashed potatoes again were quite good We skipped dessert however I think next time we ll definitely try them One last thing the waitress noticed Annie didn t eat her soup and insisted on taking it off the bill This place is quite good and probably deserves 3 5 stars I hope to do a better job on my choices next time and update this review with another star 
1ZitAVPeXrdNrKuQYdOTbg CMU I live off this stuff I m a strong advocate of fast and cheap service and even more so when their portions are huge You obviously can t expect iron chef quality food that you can eat for 2 meals for 5 so take it for what it is and enjoy it 
1ZY_qfVfS9YA_lEfzKXxwg CMU Was obsessed with this place when it first opened in Squirrel Hill and was happy that there was finally something new to try around Murray The food is consistently good but the service is dodgy at times First time we went we got the best service from a really personable waitress who was Peruvian herself Another time we waited forever to get a table while being put on three different lists by three different waitresses hostesses Love the fact that they re BYOB Our favorites are the Ceviche Causa de Langostinos Sudado Paella and Seco de Cerdo One gripe is that since the menu is so limited and unchanging after a few times there isn t a reason to go back anymore since there s nothing new to try 
1_TNLqCAB5YZvtUDRiTddw CMU I went here expecting the worst and was pleasantly surprised the place is funky Expect huge portions of cheap fairly good although on the greasy side food Bring your apetite The calzone is big enough to feed four for dinner easily Salad was okay and the salmon sandwich was better than expected but not great Next time I crave some hearty food I ll probably come back and get a pizza or calzone 
2-30OJbNLopNQrODIJQb1A CMU Their food is good and they have plenty of healthy options including an option for a veggie as your side instead of their delicious chips I work in Oakland so it s a good place to stop by and get lunch from with reasonable prices I definitely couldn t afford to eat here every day of the week 
20fLZWDXTMmwvYP-wjjMdQ CMU Came here for a late dinner this weekend No wait for a table group of 6 Atmosphere is casual and soft Service at Thai Place is mehh at best We had a relatively long wait for food despite being the only group Then they neglected to put in one of our orders for fried calimari It also took a couple times asking before we got ice for the water The food was good though nothing especial I had the panang chicken which came out pretty well Others in my group had the fried rice which was eagerly devoured as well as the fried calimari However many of the calimari pieces were batter only no calimari inside How on earth does that happen Lastly though the tom yum soup drew rave reviews Although the atmosphere was nice and the staff courteous the long wait time combined with just ok food makes me believe that there are easily better options for thai asian food in Pittsburgh 
218VdhvgVVspuxhJ6ZOVvQ CMU If you wanna see local color come to D Amicos If you wanna get a stiff drink in the middle of the afternoon while walking around with a bandage on your face and wanna fly under the radar true story come to D Amico s This place is absolutely no bells or whistles the waitresses are loud and the stale sent of grease and old liquor hangs in the air All the way down to the cracked teal vinyl seats this place is legit D Amico s just don t give a s t But it s all good Having traveled quite a bit I often find placees like this refreshing The Wedding Soup is comforting and they are generous with the bread And they have no judgements about the previously mentioned strong drink that I consumed at 2 37pm on a Friday afternoon 
22BXJTOJOxQ0wxY4Zspm3w CMU Great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking you ve been doing Many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries and only a few nights in the parking lot hanging onto the light pole for dear life while hurling up that last stoli v and ginger A great place to be drunk in not so great to be hung over in They have your typical greasy spoon fare so don t go if you re concerned about your health Otherwise eat on brave soul eat on 
22eYiPp_FlojMIfWb9ZbVA CMU Ok pizza However good luck if u have any interaction with the bartender She was the most inhumane person on 7 16 2010 7 17 2010 The owner isnt much better Only support this place if you absolutely must eat after drinking in shadyside 
22vmBrJhzkmYRN2BhCtZDw CMU the food just keeps getting worse and the other day there was a three hour wait never going back 
23mMqWbOs1ayDhOIqrGHkA CMU Great food at relatively cheap prices Their steak hoagie is great I can t tell you about anything else because that is all I get 
24Qtf6XDwwZUMvQvnw65NQ CMU I don t usually like chains but I m so happy that this Panera exists It s a great location and it s nice to have somewhere to escape from the rain or cold hey it s Pittsburgh the weather sucks I like Dozen Cupcakes better for the cuteness but Panera is more convenient for using wifi and escaping from people I ve come here with friends too though As far as I know the food is the same at every Panera which can be a good thing It sure beats McDonald s when I m somewhere unfamiliar 
270tvHqDekoAGb4NdBt7tA CMU came here for a lunch buffet and i am a huge fan of indian food Friend took me to one in squirrel hill and it was delicious but this was not the case here at tamarind I live right down the street at the king edward and was hoping this place would be a gem Okay i tried i really really TRIED to like this place but when your chicken tikka masala is the ONLY dish i d consider borderline acceptable during a lunch buffet that s a problem c mon its chicken tikka masala make the chicken tender and the sauce takes care of itself this felt like chewing rubber with a side of gravel the one star is there for the excellent service who was also nice enough to leave his name Martin standup fellow and number i wouldn t be so cruel on a napkin for our friend because she was cute as hell 
27e_3oc5Bn-yOWOcLqLAfg CMU The best crepes I ve ever had I have tried to find something that compares but I can t and I don t know if I will It can get pretty busy in here and often there can be a line but it is worth the wait Just as a note When you go in you should order first and then find a table It often can be busy enough that all the tables are full at the moment you walk in You should wait your turn and order at the counter Once you have placed your order take a seat They will probably not let you order until an open table has popped up Thus if it is busy don t be a jerk whether you meant it or not by grabbing a table as soon as you see it open up if you are waiting in line Also if I remember correctly it is cash only 
27nDPIrnPegLCM26MkOqJg CMU Place was great Had the tandoori shrimp and although few was great ilas I dipped in my friends gourmet sauce she ordered the kofta veggie I d definitely recommend to others and go back sooner than later Also the service was good started off slow but got great in the end 
28DQLxRTLTpgLkbV5cqafw CMU I was excited to see a Filipino restaurant in Squirrel Hill but the food was only okay to me Still the option of eating Filipino food here is great 
28hWKzmUh5AReXaOPkageg CMU Half price after 11PM which is a good reason to go for college students I went here pretty often Things to try for sure are the blue cornbread and any of the burritos The quesadillas and nachos aren t bad either 
28JcAkf9UFj-1uPkynvnIA CMU Doc s Place offers cheap bar food in a chill atmosphere The biggest perk Doc s has to offer is their price There is always a special on something on the menu every single day from half priced burgers to half priced pizzas Their pizza s are huge but not particularly tasty Their burgers are definitely bargains at half price but nothing spectacular either I like my burgers rare medium rare the last one I had at Doc s seemed to have a darker color than a typical burger I wasn t sure if it was because the meat was frozen or just not fresh I didn t get sick so there were no issues Anyways Doc s Place is a nice place to hang out in the spring and fall as the outdoor balcony is quiet and peaceful the food just isn t anything noteworthy 
29cyhIDiIMCZY-NewHfgDg CMU This is one of my go to lunch spots in Shadyside The food and service is consistent and they have a great beer selection This is a great place to come and watch a game You can usually find a seat even when everywhere else is packed because it is not the typical sports bar It is also a good spot to grab bite late night I came here today and ordered the Tijuana Tuna this is the only place I will order a tuna sandwich from and it comes with hot peppers that add a bit of kick to the traditional tuna as well as a sweet honey sauce that compliments the spiciness perfectly The honey sauce also goes great with the chips Today I tried a bite of the Chicken and Spinach Panini as well and it was equally as appealing it will probably be what I order next time 
29eJpZguaC-w05qORamSPA CMU Contrary to a lot of the other reviews posted I think Ginza is getting sort of a bad rep because lots of people are ordering from their Japanese side of the menu when they really should have a closer look at the Korean stuff The restaurant s owner is Korean She s a fascinating woman she s a cook of all trades but her born and bred sense of hometown Korean cooking is evident in the Korean food we got It s a family business and it s at the very least friendly and talkative on a slow day My favorite dish of the day was the Dolsot Bibimbap Although it wasn t quite as crisp as other Dolsot Bibimbaps I ve had before the vegetables were still fresh and offered good contrast to the piping hot rice My own order the Jiajang Myun wasn t as spectacular In fact I d probably proffer that it was sort of on the runny side with strong traces of the fat still in it It was alright but probably something I wouldn t get a second time Overall I think I will look forward to trying this place again but this time I ll steer clear of the Japanese selections and shoot for the heartier Korean dishes 
29m05-zEoI_aJe5nD1xHqg CMU You can t tell the difference between food here and food in Japan bottom line An authentic Pittsburgh Best Eatery 
2B6-SMBXdB0ueHnjB6tITA CMU As mexican as it gets around here had an awesome experience eating off a sidewalk taco cart and squatting on someone s front steps in the middle of the night options pork chicken and beef And a full condiment bar real corn tortillas Delicious and at 2 a taco as good as it gets 
2bopRyI1clRa3UHxsBzaAQ CMU The best brunch in Pittsburgh After Doing brunch at about five other places this place really stands out The French toast was perfectly done with nutella and fruit The scramble was perfectly done as well with the right level of moisture and a hint but not overwhelming amount of goat cheese with a perfectly done potato pancake The dinner is pretty good too with a solid black bean burger and a memorable fish taco being on the offerings on that menu Prompt and attentive but not pushy wait staff round out this review One of my favorite restaurants in the burgh 
2BsostZqByVDSW-NyKPKEw CMU I m definitely a fan of Taza 21 My mom and I had lunch there a couple of weeks ago and we have been trying to go back ever since We both had wraps and they were great Make sure you try the cucumber sauce it s delicious 
2CANXDuE2uSFJvEhqqQRAQ CMU After a disappointing previous experience with BBQ in the city I was hoping that Yinzburgh could redeem the city s BBQ scene Upon finding out the owners were from Georgia I thought to myself these guys gotta know what reall BBQ is Turns out they do My first time at YB I tried the pulled pork with a side of cole slaw and macaroni and cheese I m picky about all three of those things so it was a leap of faith to get them all and have high expectations I was very happy with everything I ordered The pork was tender and full of flavor even without the BBQ sauce The cole slaw was creamy and had the right amount of tanginess The mac n cheese actually tastes homemade and is creamy with a lot of cheddar cheese Score My second trip to YB I tried the brisket Oh Em Gee This brisket is perfect Fork tender with a perfectly charred outer crust and tell tale smoke ring Take that hipster BBQ joint on N Highland Maybe you can learn something from these guys YB has 3 homemade sauces to cover the BBQ geography of your St Louis style red BBQ sauce Carolina Style vinegar sauce and a mustard based sauce It s hard to chose a favorite because they are all good on any of the meats The smoked wings are a must try as well 
2Ct7BnpEpPUqsJj6J7mxUQ CMU For a quick decent Chinese place in Shadyside check out China Palace You get what you expect it s fast and not too expensive I ve only had delivery but when I want Chinese food I ve never had any surprises At the end of the day you get what you pay for As for delivery in they area it s decent enough 
2DaTc5JIqfCxl8aMfg-_vA CMU Went there to celebrate with some friends and I was excited to try some Mexican food something I d been missing since I moved from San Diego to Pittsburgh Since there was a long wait we got margaritas and waited for the tables I got a strawberry margarita but the flavor was unnecessary as all I could taste was cheap nasty tequila Gross To mitigate the taste and try not to be sloshed before dinner we asked for some chips and salsa while we waited When we finally got some 15 minutes later I was buzzed and disappointed The chips and salsa were worse than even the store brand from the supermarket My opinion if a Mexican food restaurant can t do the good chips and salsa and margaritas I don t even want to try anything else We paid our tab and left before our table was even ready No thank you 
2DbecSJbF1Wu5A1Ukn_r-Q CMU These are the best casual food burgers I ve had but I had fast food written there first which would definitely be wrong I get a little annoyed at them taking 15 minutes to make a burger in a place that has a less charming interior than McDonalds The long wait time is the only thing that stops me from going here more than twice a year or so It s hard to find a clean table here as well Fries are very good but annoyingly large portions 
2DFvc5Z6W3rcJXQPYoJrEQ CMU Authentic food cozy environment recommendations are 61 73 service is little bit slow you usually wait for 20mins to get your dishes 
2g84hN-IL5Mni8X8Gi3epQ CMU Consistently tasty The waffles here are unlike any waffles I ve had before I have visited this place upwards of ten times in the past year and I enjoy the consistently tasty selection The ice cream is amazing and it s nice to have a fresh fruit option I highly recommend this place as a morning date though it may also be good as a late night snack Try the speculoos 
2G9JmzXj4jxArN_pJEuyng CMU This is the only restaurant in central Oakland that is both tasty and reasonably healthy Plus they make a big deal of using sustainably locally grown foods whenever possible I have to disagree with one of the reviewers disdain for the soup the spicy gumbo is pretty good though I always end up having to add extra hot sauce My personal favorite things about Red Oak include 1 Newly expanded hours 7 AM 9 PM so I can usually get food when I m hungry 2 Blue plate special is a really good deal My favorite one is jambalaya but the pulled pork and the fish are also good 3 Vegetarian blue plate option beans veg grain usually not terribly exciting but definitely healthy and tasty in an unassertive way 4 You can get vegetables as a side dish instead of chips 5 Oatmeal smoothie should be absolutely disgusting by any standard of reckoning but it is actually really delicious and can be a meal substitute in a pinch if you re running really late and have to drink your breakfast out of a straw while you run to class 6 All the sandwiches and salads are really tasty and you can get a salad made into a wrap if you want The things that kind of annoy me about Red Oak 1 It gets really crowded over lunchtime and if the short middle aged woman who works there thinks you ve taken long enough to eat your meal she will tell you so Best times to go are before or after the big lunchtime rush 2 It s a bit more expensive than the other lunch restaurants in that part of town but totally worth it especially when you consider that the food is fresh and good for you unlike the other restaurants in Oakland 
2gFDzKuTgQy-6V5XzJOExw CMU Pretty good little indian spot Cool dining room old house turned into restaurant Service was not bad a little difficult to understand at times tho Food was generally good I ve only had indian a few times so it s hard for me to compare but here s what I could gather I had the chicken vindaloo the sauce was very good very spicy I like spicy but the chicken was dry and the potatoes tasted odd they were either pre made frozen or deepfried and then became soggy I m not sure My gf has the tikka masala which was about on the same level Dry chicken undercooked peppers good sauce tho The Channa Batura on the other hand was exceptionally good Comes with a chickpea curry which tasted damn near perfect Came same time as the rest of the food for some reason but could not recommend this dish more There s a good chance we ll return for more 
2GgfkmDhvVxvglvCZs1A9A CMU You would not think this was going to be a good time Toast is strategically located between the Hillman Cancer Center and Cricket s strip club overlooking the bus highway Parking is on the street The building itself is nondescript Walk in Inside it is warm dark and VERY COZY The crowd is laid back and friendly The menu is sophisticated yet not fussy The restaurant has confidence We went there once with reservations and the manager immediately said I have a seat upstairs but no one is up there I m guessing you want to be downstairs Let me buy you a glass of wine and we ll get you seated when the next table comes up here That s the kind of smart service you want Loved it Overall Very sexy Bring your spouse Bring a date Bring both They ll thank you for it 
2gGKP0YOg4yrldW_owkaZg CMU Dude get the morning after breakfast my friend says What is it he says Don t worry trust me Most of the time this scenerio has a bad ending but this time I am glad I took my stoner friend s advice The morning after breakfast is their banana chocolate chip pancakes with bacon egg and sausage It was so so so so good If you re coming to visit Pittsburgh you have to go to Pamelas My only gripe about it is that for a breakfast place they open late 7 30am 
2gwZQqDgVa77r44brevQxA CMU I was told that we absolutely had to check this place out as it s apparently a famous local chain dating back to the coal mining days We went there for lunch at a fairly busy time so waiting for service took a little while I was a little confused as to whether we were supposed to order up or just seat ourselves but it was apparently the latter Do make sure you catch someone s eye when you re going there for lunch as they have an upstairs and a downstairs to serve and as far as i can tell barely a handful of people at work It s probably a good thing we went there hungry Each item on the menu is already more than filling including the so called sides They definitely deliver on their promise that every sandwich ordered is piled high with fries cole slaw and tomatoes unless you ask otherwise The meat might be a little hard to find beneath all these but not to worry it s there and you can still taste it Their streetman fries are a heart attack in a basket fries with chili cheese bacon and sour cream Don t order it as a side unless there s quite a few in your party It really is a meal to itself and more It s definitely worth at least one visit 
2hqpc3ztTxMR-pgrHOC4uA CMU I had heard a lot about Toast from a friend and was excited to try it Unfortunately I was underwhelmed I ordered fish over a bed of rice and the rice was very dry not Basmati try but dry to the point of being hard and undercooked The rest of my food was average but I think there are better restaurants in Pittsburgh at this price range Where Toast shines is as a wine bar The wine list is excellent and the atmosphere is intimate Parties are seated close together and if I were to give Toast another try it would likely be on a date 
2IpBhwrV-lXCebTlLKd-VQ CMU The food is good but the service and atmosphere is terrible I have been to this place a few times and it s always slow and there s not usually a table available to sit down at They sell a variety of six packs and 40s to go but beware Boone s Farm is quite literally the top shelf The staff is very rude on my last visit they messed up my order and gave me general tso s chicken instead of tofu The counter lady was pretty mean to me when I asked for it to be remade She then proceeded to give what should have been my meal to another guy who DID order chicken after me but who didn t want to take it because I had ordered extra spicy and he didn t want spicy food The cashier laughed at him argued with him that even medium would be too hot for him and in the end got him take my messed up order reluctantly She then proceeded to help five more people before she had the chef make the tofu that I ordered Like I said the food is good but I wouldn t go back to this place There are too many other Asian restaurants in Oakland where they don t make it difficult to get what you ordered 
2j68598aW38AsusySWzbEQ CMU Orgasm for the mouth soft and sweet but not too sweet I had the nutella banana waffle and adored it My friend had the strawberres and cream and liked hers as well My waffle was not cooked all the way in the middle and I didn even blink an eye I just kept swooping that delicious forkful of belgian inspired wonder right onto my tongue Coffee is priced fairly cheap just drip coffee buts ok in a pinch for coffee I love lattes and cappucinos so I would love if they had this option on their menu but that would make it more of a patisserie than a waffle shop All in all fun little stop great snack to warm you up from your shopping trips down murray ave I don t know how it compares to Oh yeah s over in shadyside but after comparing yelp reviews I chose it over the 3rd waffle shop which is close to Oh yeahs name escapes me The only gripe I have with some of the shadyside eats and treats places including Oh yeah s are the hours catering to nightlifers That may be good for business but you re missing business from us thirty somethings who graduated kindergarten and love to enjoy brunch at brunch time sunday morning to afternoon 
2JF5iM4BmXQ_t0P9pwFVkQ CMU I ve only visited the Murrysville location and there is no way it even comes close to In N Out Burger The food is extremely greasy so much so that it drips off the burger as you eat it The fries are greasy too and not at all crispy The free toppings were gross bacon full of fat soggy mushrooms must be all the grease Worst of all the prices are not reasonable I m not sure why other reviewers are even comparing the two In N Out is more fast food Five Guys seems more restaurant style no drive through etc Anyway there must be a better option for burgers and fries 
2JQ1cDosm6m9AOoemg-9Sw CMU I came here on a Friday night around 9 pm with my boyfriend and my parents who were staying at a nearby B and B We wanted to go somewhere both casual and inexpensive and La Feria definitely is both of those things We almost didn t find it it s upstairs above Pamela s Pamela s was closed of course but all the lights were on and we eventually figured out to ascend the staircase and seek out La Feria There was only one other table of diners so it was very quiet in the eating area There are about 15 tables and there are boldly colored Peruvian crafts everywhere you look We all decided to order lemonade and limeade which was a great choice The drinks were refreshing and fresh not too sour or too sweet I ordered one of the daily specials which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce It came with white rice a green salad with two kinds of cheese two tomatoes slices an olive red onion walnuts and light dressing and two slices of French bread The chicken itself was great the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice I really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and I looooove cheese The bread was pretty standard so I used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce Nom My boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich which I tasted Not as much meat as I d like but it was very juicy and flavorful Also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting For dessert we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them Everyone really enjoyed their meal It just feels like a good place to spend your money It s small it s cheap it s interesting food and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable I think we d be happy to go back if we were ever in the neighborhood I really want to taste those empanadas 
2js1f4it7yZAZeGY2nhU9w CMU Typical americanized Asian food that serves three stars As a broke college student within walking distance of Lulu s I continue to go there due to convenience and the sheer fact that it is exponentially better than college campus food The problem I have with Lulu s is not the food itself it is to be expected with the prices but it is with the service There is a definite inconsistency with the service and at times my friends and I are left waiting for someone to take our order for 20 minutes despite letting the hostess know how long we have been waiting Or chasing down a waitress for more water I don t know if they treat us like this because we are college students but I feel that service is one of their biggest weakness So come here if you want large portions for a fair price and don t expect too good of service But as long as I go to Carnegie Mellon and I am broke I will still go here 
2k3MofKieNIv5I5rXSxcOA CMU Nice atmosphere confusing concept A coworker and I had lunch at the porch a few weeks ago At lunch you place your order and are given an order number and can sit anywhere you like much like Hello Bistro which is run by the same organization We decided to eat outside since it was a nice day someone brought our iced teas and our meals quickly followed The pizza I ordered was good but we weren t sure how to get our iced teas refilled which didn t last very long on a 90 degree day There wasn t anyone going around so I eventually went inside and refilled our glasses with water from the self serve containers Great location ok food but a bit overpriced for self serve 
2KBC-pxd_KP6ZJ2J1wQv_Q CMU not really japanese food the menu of food is actually a big mix of random chinese and japanese food put together the sushi it self is poor the fish quality was really bad i sat at the bar to get a closer look and after the look i decided to get things that were safe to eat such as inari tofu pockets i always order safe and cooked things when i feel the fish might be a killer several hours later the cooked food is blah i ve had much better and i m pretty sure the grocery store frozen section is better miso was super super salty and grainy which im not a fan of overall i wont be coming back if i have a choice 
2KfdH5Vcu7nrba6UNhYghA CMU Thank you to Bonnie T who mentioned that Village Pizza had moved to 815 S Aiken Ave I will leave my review there BTW that move also came with a name change they are now S Aiken Bar and Grille I was so sad when I walked by the old Village Pizza and they were closed When I read that they had moved I walked to the address and was even more confused that it did not say Village Pizza 
2l-dX7tt_bswkb7R1q-1PQ CMU Best Thai food that I have ever had The good was amazing We had the dumplings crab ragoons and pad thai The food had great tast The waitress was very attentive The mood was relaxing There were candles and it looked over looked the street Sit by the window you won t regret it 
2LpjrcwpZ_6eSU337jeJ_g CMU Yum Rangoon night market noodles mango pork indonesian festival rice lemongrass beef all make me want to come to Pittsburgh more often Want to try new things on the menu but its hard to resist old favorities Can be hard to find parking or a table but its worth the trip 
2LQ9DtzeOUmX_udEJgGeLQ CMU I d prob give Soba 3 5 stars if I could We didn t want to drive in the snow so walked over to Soba on a Friday night and actually made reservations just an hour before we prob won t get away with that on a non stormy night After a blast of warm air I was welcomed into this dark cozy and seductive venue We were led up to the top level and settled in I ordered a Sapporo calamari and tuna Beer always hits the spot for me Calamari was delicious with a nice mayo sauce with a squirt of lime The tuna was tender My butter knife cut into it so easily The side of kimchi was just okay and the abundance of hot sauce sauce was to much for me Fried rice went well with everything and balanced the tuna and sauce out We then ordered the coconut cashew brownie which was delicious too as suggested by the waitress The portions were large imho and while the service was fantastic I just thought the food was priced a tad high for what was offered Seems like Soba would be nice for a special occasion or just to have a nice dinner though 
2Lx26zkmMtAiUU--h25Srw CMU I really feel bad about giving a one star review First it s not about the service price decor or the food I m writing this review after going there twice The first time my husband and I went the dinner was good We thought this place has the potential to be our go to Chinese restaurant in Pgh Today I remembered that they have an early bird special 3 6pm m sat The won ton soup was not authentic more like chicken noodle soup but wasn t bad The entree was fine What really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco cigarette smell from the tea I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum The smell wouldn t leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine 2 3 minutes then brush as long as I could to get rid of the smell Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray first visit 3 stars second visit 5 stars 2 stars 
2n042gTdNDDLLRXWSUftLg CMU This place is a gem The food wine and service exceeded our expectations It s a great place to take a date or just get away for an excellent meal The place is a bit small so if you intend on going be sure to make a reservation a few days in advance on open table The chef apparently did his training in the Richmond VA area so you ll be able to see the southern influence in the menu For me the food completely changed my perception on what southern food could be I had a smoked pork shoulder with pureed sweet potatoes the flavor was indescribable My wife and I will pay this place a visit again for sure 
2NiuRQp2uOo0zC_CYVpZCA CMU What a production I don t even know where to start The place is small They didn t lie to me when I made the reservation Of course we had to pick the busiest day and time Saturday at 7pm The nice lady on the phone told me a reservation helps but we may still have to wait I did appreciate that tip from her Sure enough we showed up and it s PACKED The unfortunate thing is it was cold so eating on their patio was not going to happen Therefor people cram into what tiny space is allowed in the front But when I say tiny I really mean no space at all An older man pretty much barked orders at us and demanded to know if we had a reservation Thank God we did I was a little scared of him when he ran off muttering about no seating in you ain t got reservations So the first table of the restaurant is thee worst because people are standing on top of you jealously staring down at you and your food Of course we ended up with that table Thankfully our server and anyone else helping out was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable We started with the mussels app It came in a light garlic sauce and was a good amount of mussels I d say they were pretty tasty and I loved dipping the bread into the sauce The bread actually became my best companion that night more on that later I ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and mozz cheese I LOVE when Italian restaurants dump the sauce on and this was a winner I LOVE SAUCE I know some people aren t into that so I ll warn you if you like light sauce you WON T be happy After having gnocchi at Il Pizzaiolo in South Hills earlier that week I know I m on an Italian kick it didn t hold a candle to those light little pillows of pasta and potato The sauce though delicious Much to my husbands chagrin I had a hard time keeping myself from grabbing his plate He had the spinach and ricotta ravioli which I didn t have have a bite of but the SAUCE oh my Orgasmic I love tomato cream sauce and this was amazing I kept dipping my bread into his sauce with him increasingly getting annoyed Did I want to risk a fight for that delicious sauce maybe It was soooo good But the real action took place as we were finishing up our meal I had noticed the older dude owner walking around with a glass of red wine the whole time I thought that he was pretty rude but kinda funny in a typical Italian way Well I start to sense a commotion beside me and realize the owner and a server are in a heated convo Then the older dude screams get outta here you F A hole and then shoves him Whoa I was shocked a boss would do that to an employee Come to find out it s his son A woman who I assume was also part of management maybe even a family member came over to our table and apologized joked this was normal Italian behavior and offered us free dessert I thought that was really nice of her and and appreciated I just feel bad because those kind of things take down a business The good was great but witnessing that you wonder how long you can work like that Hopefully the dude can retire to a nice Italian villa with lots of wine instead of screaming at his son in the middle of his restaurant 
2nwhw66COV0xdkOmia7_BA CMU I had a terrible experience at Toast after enjoying it several times The food I was served was inedible and I have NEVER before sent food back in a restaurant I was told that they were too busy to make me anything else So I ate salad and dessert for dinner They didn t apologize or try to do anything to make it right I have contacted them numerous times since then and despite being told that it was just a bad night they have not done anything to make it up to me or to make me willing to return So disappointing 
2OiB3PRkovFTTcQlvEYqDQ CMU Went to Big Jim cause Guy went there before and there is not too much individual diner on yelp close by Ok the let s go have a average expectation Guy s recommendation bottom line is edible and sometimes have surprise but not this time Atmosphere is good like an average diner but places is not clean carpet smells and table is sticky that s ok food should be good Me and my wife order the Steak Hoagie comes with salad and the Spaghetti and meat sauce with 2 meat ball extra Salad came first it is a mix wit shredded iceberg lettuce grape style tiny tomato some purple cabbage with home salad dressing Lettuce is DARK BAD and MUSSY since I was on vacation I worry I had stomach ache so I skip it The Steak Hoagie for five buck I give a 2 thumbs up bread is soft hot and toast on spot although the mayo on the sandwich is quite a bit the outcome balance the steak with fresh sliced tomato some shredded iceberg lettuce then question coming how come the salad iceberg lettuce are so sucks pls prepare as per order instead it is not a fast food joint Last and I never come back is the meat ball the Spaghetti and meat sauce I don t know how to describe how could it be like this I am pretty sure Guy s taste bud is excellent no doubt but this is too much and hit my bottom line for food spaghetti is ok not too soggy just a little more watery About the meat sauce is ok but taste like can sauce and fresh tomato and shredded meat mix together still ok edible I will give a pass BUT THE MEAT BALL OMG taste like 1 it is mussy pretty bland 2 it taste weird then I try to smells it OMG I threw all of them on the plate it smells like shit it either over cook or something wrong At the end of today I did went to washroom 2 times I am pretty sure I will not come back 
2oWYvenLVc-EJP_NWI8sJQ CMU Best Indian I have had so far in Pittsburgh Food is well spiced and the saag is probably the best I have ever had Naan left a little bit to be desired Service is a bit sloppy slow easily flustered but friendly nonetheless They got my order wrong and didn t offer to fix it probably because I was happy with what they sent out and had already eaten half of it All in all I will go back 
2p5CmCV541yjoSb24DtIRQ CMU Fusion is difficult to pull off well Have you ever noticed that Fusion almost always involves East Asian food and American cuisine Thai corn chowder Are they really going crazy for corn chowder in Chang Mai You never find say Mexican Moroccan or Ethiopian Brazilian fusion places That would be really inventive Instead with Soba you have another pan Asian American Fusion joint although I don t think I ve been to a better one The mussels are incredible a meal in themselves and a bargain at 9 I had the chopped salad with fresh mango avocado mint and just a hint of spice The best meal I ve had here was the mussels followed by the tuna The crabcakes are also good made with lump crabmeat If you feel like something vaguely Asian but not too Asian ex kimchee pancakes you won t find a better option But if you want something truly original you have to go elsewhere 
2pEFfCFN27LPNyLOXV9iTg CMU The pastrami sandwiches are sooooooooooooooo good AND it has fries on it It s huge and horrible for you but you ll love it 
2pUQd9pbBCm1bTZvcF9-Vg CMU CLOSED This place is gone 
2Q0rrAKuhQpOPkYLQc1SiA CMU Great Remodel Place looks fantastic Great Service Waitress was on her game and seemed to know the name of some of the people at the other tables Good food The Buffalo chicken salad was good and the honey buns are delicious My associate had eggs and bacon and said the eggs were perfect and you could tell they were fresh not out of a box Later our waitress confirmed that and went on to explain how they work with local farmers to make everything as fresh as possible The rolls from the bakery were fresh and good Enjoyed the coffee too For the price it can t be beat 
2qLS8_bNwnXdZAPBPr2WvA CMU Always a pleasure to eat in a Japanese owned sushi restaurant Ambience is bucolic weird description I know but the atmosphere was very calming Lots of thought goes into the presentation My friend ordered the blackened cod which was served on an expertly fashioned banana leaf 
2rIJ4m_JiLWtHZKhAJo1-w CMU Amazing food Really enjoyed the complexity of these dishes Very unique and the service was fantastic I ll definitely return here again 
2rq5ZDSRSWJ26cMb9PzlKg CMU Surprisingly good food for such an oddly uninviting storefront Pick up order was ready within 10 minutes of my phone call which involves silly levels of efficiency Squid salad wasn t so spicy but was really good Sliced ginger was a little strong but squid was actually tender Laos spearmint came with cubed chicken zucchini carrots broccoli standard veggies Not a very strongly flavored dish I didn t think I d ever use the word subtle for a takeout place but it s appropriate Avocado shake was like any other avocado shake except for a few ice chunks that hadn t been blended in all the way Really good for Pittsburgh extra points for being 2 blocks away and cheapish 
2S6J97DCyncmBdEj-XMNuw CMU The falafel was dry and not very crisp I got a falafel wrap and it was more salad iceberg lettuce and few tomatoes cucumbers than falafel I only counted 2 falafel balls Overall wasn t impressed and wouldn t go back unless desperate 
2sfdovJgU_cQCbfGOAeEBw CMU Wow this was good A group of 6 of us went last night showing up with our own case of beer We essentially ordered enough varied entrees for the table to create our own buffet I don t have a refined Indian food palate so I usually stick to the safe stuff BUT I will tell you the Chicken tika masala was one of the best that I ve ever had Plates were licked clean the sauce was so amazing The Vindaloo was also great we ordered it super spicy and it delivered Saag Paneer was better than most places as well very rich and delicious I really enjoyed that this was in an old house converted to a restaurant Many of the Indian places in pittsburgh don t pay much attention to ambiance or setting Tamarind gives it a little more attention apologies if I ve butchered the spelling of any Indian dishes 
2sMMj16R0mDYXZWn917KbA CMU Lulu s noodles is in an extremely convenient location for students coming from CMU so it should be no surprise that most weekdays around lunch time the place is packed The few times I have been there I have found the food to be okay nothing to write home about The Pho was utterly terrible and the various noodle dishes only passable The biggest problem though has been with the service You place your order at the counter and they are supposed to bring it to you Several times I ve found myself forgotten and having to go back to ask where my food is All in all it will do in a pinch if you re a CMU student otherwise steer clear 
2srFCtHwMrGmQvgvglUVxg CMU Apparently I will do anything for a well dressed salad Their salad is fantastic and so is the bread that comes with it However the first floor and bathrooms ALWAYS smell like sewage The last time I was there the ceiling was leaking and kept dripping on us and bc the restaurant was packed we had to demand to be moved to another table In fact this restaurant always feels straight up dirty The food is just alright but there are a few standout items like the omelette and the wedding soup 
2T9u3ZqVPAqNInNzoVCmbg CMU A decent deli for Pittsburgh but this place is no match for other deli s around the country It will never be a Brent s LA They have a huge menu with very reasonable prices The staff is very friendly I started off with a bowl of matzo ball soup This was one of the worst bowls that I have every have 2 lumps of matzo balls in chicken broth There was no carrots noodles chicken or flavor I ordered the corned beef and latkes for dinner The latkes were excellent served with applesauce and sour cream The Noodle Kugel side that I ordered was OK but not great definitely didn t taste homemade The corned beef was very average and looked and tasted closer to grocery store quality than deli quality I saw some of the sandwiches that others ordered reuben vs rachel coleslaw instead of sauerkraut They looked very good Are there no bakeries in Pittsburgh They get their deserts from New York German Chocolate cake Carrot Cheesecake Key Lime Pie Coconut Cake and Red Velvet cake 
2TpXJcqf7ngYTm0TBRGdmw CMU Service 2 5 stars out of 5 Food 2 5 stars Price 4 stars easily under 10 person Atmosphere 1 stars unless you like shouting and being cold A number of people have said that this a great place for college students to get decent cheap food I completely concur My low marks come from the fact that I don t want food that is just decent or cheap I want it to be tasty and I m willing to pay for that Also it felt like a college cafeteria the stereo was loudly playing poppy dance hip hop and rock songs So I m getting a whole bunch of pop lyrics layered with everyone around me shouting over the music I could barely hear my wife right across the table There seemed to be a cool breeze blowing across my legs from somewhere Perhaps it was from the 8 inch hole in the wall behind us The food was greasy yet satisfying The white rice was a bit chewier than I like it At least the tea was tasty and stayed nice and hot 
2uKYrNvSbB1rsxwDbkvrfw CMU I went with an out of town friend for lunch and wish I had taken her elsewhere Our waitress looked half asleep and was not knowledgeable about the menu I got a Pizza Margherita and the center was actually soggy How did they mess that up My friend said her sandwich was good but neither of us took the leftovers home with us Meh 
2uU0emx-VgBKcykDZlxVOg CMU This is like being in a movie about a diner minus the fake quality Awesome people watching I recommend the fried green tomatoes and the hot brown These might be okay in the light of day Other things not so much 
2UXxwmiWryDVohr_rRZRPg CMU Great healthy and fresh food I highly recommend for lunch but sometimes the wait can be a little long Garden veggie goat cheese chicken and salads are a good bet A little more expensive than some chain restaurants for lunch but worth it 
2vc__5mZ2auEaban26OHzg CMU Typical dinner place on the level of a good Applebees with great Margaritas 
2Y-GvAY3gKJJoDgAMSvsMg CMU We received good service and the food was good and consistent and the prices were reasonable Based on our experience with a few high end restaurants while in Pittsburgh this warrants 4 stars 
2YjlZbQBCYu5lCzsQCeQuA CMU I only stopped into the cute little shop for a quick gelato with a friend and I m glad that I did Its a very cute shop that offers food and gelato I tried the Mango Gelato and also the Salted Caramel Gelato and it was good I ll def revisit I d be very curious to try some of the tasty flat breads that were coming out of the kitchen area 
2ym-eeiBpKub6lmzdovd7Q CMU Nice selection of items good pricing and friendly atmosphere We ll be back 
2yr_PT9p_M1pZZmupRLwQQ CMU I was expecting a lot more from JT but realized that it is a restaurant that serves both chinese and korean but not in a fusion type of way It merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu The idea was cute They even have typical chinese lunch specials The deco needs upgrading and dusting some lighting or even natural light its like walking in a cave and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air I had a craving for comfort food and ordered Jajangmyeon and grilled calamari The tea and water was served as I sat down I went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people The calamari came out promptly and the Jajangmyeon took a little longer The portions were huge What took the longest and annoyed me the most I was the only one left at the restaurant was waiting for the check Why does waiting for the check take 45 minutes They never came the clear the table or walked by so that I could signal that I needed the check I should have just walked out The food was okay but I seriously needed to get in and out of there in a certain time frame that they didn t help with You may want to consider going when you have a 2 hour lunch break 
2ZV9nuYkoB2MXgHNxqk5hw CMU As you have read from all of the other reviews the service at Brasserie 33 stinks That s all you can really say Some say if you are looking for gourmet not service go here Seriously If I m spending the money on a roasted chicken I should get served in an appropriate amount of time I shouldn t have to wave down a water boy for a refill of water I shouldn t have to flag down a server just for my check our dinner plates were taken away 30 minutes prior no one asked if we wanted dessert The food Yes it s good The service will keep me from going back I can get better service at Denny s 
2Zvoz_89Xa1rwsE9wjA5Kw CMU I moved to Bloomfield in April and being Italian and loving Italian food I thought that Little Italy would be a good fit I was wrong Until tonight I have found that every Italian restaurant I ve tried has left much to be desired from Del s atrocious food to the over hyped Pleasure Bar I had not found an Italian joint I liked Lombardozzi I have not clue why I had not tried you until tonight I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal We started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection and no rubbery feel which is a positive because 99 of places outside the east coast can t to calamari to save their lives I had the gnocchi with red sauce only sauce option which kind of irks me because gnocchi is great with a pesto with meatballs The gnocchi is homemade and to die for and the sauce is pretty good too I m a sauce snob nobody beats my mothers or grandmothers and the meatballs were as good as I remembered Great food experience but the service was at best bad The waitress took over five minutes to get our drink order and just kind of seemed annoyed at the whole working thing I will be back because there is no Italian food in Bloomfield that even comes close to Lombardozzi 
2_Mssa9TjCxdS9MVleSLiA CMU Today was my third time eating something from Szmidt s and it keeps getting better From a plain turkey or tuna salad sandwich to what is probably the best chicken salad I ve ever had mango and feta everything is so fresh and delicious My husband has tried the Sanchez rage which is ridiculous but amazing and absolutely loved it The bread is to die for as well Fresh thick slices of homemade rye bread or homemade white rolls I m kind of concerned that this is literally at the end of my street I will probably be there way too often 
3-9KGPAv5BB-88dmcts1xQ CMU This is a great BYO spot with outdoor seating on Ellsworth The menu isn t very extensive but what they do have is very good and the prices are perfect Their lamb for the gyros and gyro salads is very flavorful and they give you a lot The service was a little slow but it was nice to not be interrupted constantly while eating It was a very relaxing meal and I will absolutely be going back I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were just a few more apps and or entrees to choose from It is definitely worth a try 
3-AkxDzgfA_xR41I0k7Xtg CMU Excellent lunch and desert crepes in a fun atmosphere Super tasty but a bit pricey and the place is usually quite crowded As long as you re not in a hurry this place is great Try a cappuccino with your lunch 
3-d70ebdrrTF_Blnybdy3Q CMU Do not go here if you are on a budget and or really hungry However if you have an expense account or are a guest of someone with an expense account as I was last night than this is a good option In fact this is the best sushi I ve had in Pittsburgh Umi is a part of the admirable big burrito group It s located above Soba It s up two long sets of stairs so if you are bringing someone handicapable or elderly they ll have trouble navigating the double staircases As I was walking up the stairs last night I noticed the painted large waves on the walls I believe Umi is japanese for big wave maybe Our reservation was for 6 30 and initially they only had the tatami tables where you sit on the ground and your feet dangle in a hole in the floor These tables are probably okay for date night but would have been weird with two business associates Luckily a table opened up If it s this busy on a Tuesday I suggest a reservations Anyways the rest of the space is very nice with a sushi bar with about 5 seats as soon as you enter and very warm colors with a few scuptures and a waterfall in the middle of the dining room The service was pretty good There was nothing particularly memorable I started with a Mark West Chardonnay which was okay and priced under 10 They also have a good selection of warm and cold sake I started with the white tuna sashimi which was a few slices of super fresh melt in your mouth tuna with a nice soy sauce and just the right amount of wasabi Matt tried the shrimp tempura which was perfectly breaded quickly fried light shrimp with veggies This was a good deal at 12 Keith had the lobster soup which had a few big chunks of lobster and a nice broth I ordered the toro tartar with caviar which was probably a teaspoon of super creamy fatty tuna and a touch of caviar This was really rich and one of the most expensive teaspoon serving I ve ever had at 21 for such a small amount Keith had some noodle dish which he said was good and actually was pretty reasonable but again it s noodles Matt ordered the strip steak tataki which was about 1 1 2 ounces of prime steak served with a sweet soy sauce It was delicious but again 20 for less than a 2 oz serving I stuck with sashimi The lobster sashimi was great and had some type of flavored sauce instead of just soy The salmon and tuna were also amazing They were cut perfectly and tasted like they were just pulled from the sea Overall a really good sashimi dinner however I have to admit I did stop for pizza a few hours later 
325t7hB5zAwRMbkRAE3qSg CMU I ll echo the finally good BBQ in Pittsburgh sentiment albeit with less experience hunting after the first few rave reviews I read on other places came up with disappointment Never again will I miss BBQ in this town Yinzburgh just does it right by the meat this is meat that tastes like meat and not like sauce You can tell they are cooking with love because the favors are all there and the staff is clearly proud of their product I m solidly hooked on the honey mustard sauce but all three are downright tasty Do yourself a favor and at least give them a try you won t regret it and I can bet you ll be as hooked as I am 
32GjJfEmo9IYikCoL_4hxA CMU Wasn t that hungry and was looking for a good places for alcohol and appetizers and stumbled upon Harris Fun times NICE Unique selection of beers I m no expert but I hadn t heard of 3 4 of them and the waiter recommended a tasty blueberry one Decent spicy mussels Not the best I ve ever had but be honest with yourself you re not going to find awesome seafood in Pittsburgh Wasn t rubbery at all and the sauce was nice Tasty perfectly sized bite sized cheeseburger appetizers Wings that weren t too greasy yet very flavorful We were there for bacon night Who would have thought eating strips of plain ol bacon would be good It is Nice patio Not too packed so you can talk yet busy enough that you feel like you re part of the action Friendly attentive helpful waiter WEIRD Took forever to get drinks and food My coworker said the wings weren t legit jerk chicken like advertised The patio was a little too romantic Meaning it was so dark I couldn t read the menu except by holding it up to the little candle at our table Ditto when we went inside for a bit Maybe that d be awesome if I was on a sexy date instead of with two coworker dudes I wasn t All in all I d come back if I was looking for a date place to have a light dinner or a place to chill with some close friends 
344x0dQQGm8j-hP0x5OYsQ CMU Good burgers and mac cheese 
34zz_4mS152QUqDI3jy47w CMU Sandwich quality is equivalent to make it yourself at home except I could do it better Maybe I should have opted for one of the oven roasted but the regular sandwiches were overpriced The tomato bisque was good and would be the only reason I would ever return The service was less than helpful It s okay if you don t know the answer but it d be nice if they asked someone else instead of disregarding my question and giving me something I told them I didn t want Also if you re vegan the options are really limited to essentially soup or chili I was expecting a lot more variety since the logo and name imply a healthier alternative but like everything else it was a disappointment The price is equivalent to panera which is overpriced but the quality and service do not make up for such high prices Looks like I ll be sticking to Panera or even subway At least subway charges a decent price and actually offers more flavor 
37dQoA_1pf-3JfxvxUyvVw CMU Mediocre food and tacky decor would be the most generous way of describing this place Convenience to Pitt may be the only thing this place has going for it and perhaps they re hoping that your average student isn t discerning enough to notice that everything else is lacking My chicken parmesan was dry and bland and it came with a side of heavily salted boiled or steamed vegetables summer squash and zucchini So heavily salted that I m retching a little thinking about them The waitress seated us under the air conditioner and when we asked to move because were so cold she commented on the fact that we weren t the first party she had to move as a result Why she couldn t have seated us elsewhere in the mostly empty restaurant is beyond me This place was a poor welcome to Italian food in Pittsburgh and I can only hope my next experience is better 
37KzgNPozbRpixRH9kUH3A CMU Service was incredible I ordered the hotcakes with strawberries that they re known for and a side of the lyonnaise potatoes to try them Those potatoes are delicious The hotcakes are very good as well Give them a try 
37WueYIeisAVl-jRI_LVXg CMU Our reservation was originally scheduled at 830 though we werent seated until nearly 930 i was an out of towner and felt no need to sugar coat how i felt about being made to wait on a leather couch for an hour after 2 glasses of Piscoe when we were seated our wait staff and the host profusely appologized for the wait they were very attentive thereafter and comped our first few rounds but i think it was because i pushed my boobs up mentioned that they should the food presentation was excellent and the taste was slightly above average the shrimp and grits were subpar the Frog was more fishy than i think was acceptable and covered in fava beans although we ordered no salads we were comped one of every one on the menu the duck was excellent as a main course i ordered the suckling pig the meat was tendor and well executed though i thought it looked more like mousakka i was really happy with the presentation i thought for sure i was going to be seeing a little Wilber or Babe on my plate after witnessing what the frog legs looked like Dessert was great im a big softy for creme brulee and they had their own version of tapioca creme brulee French press to cap off the night after all my free Piscoes was excellent All in all if we hadnt been comped so much i think our tab would have been close to 4 or 500 for the 3 of us our bill ran about 160 so i was content 
38YM64TDEgh3jh_v-2GsyQ CMU Get a square pizza and a family of four can eat for days 
39OnPB3xLzLU8Vd-ppW71A CMU its a alright place servers are wonderful but didn t quite enjoy the food 
3a4Arz49wCDwCSOf-Yz2Dw CMU Really great option for cantonese food in Oakland I ve never ordered from the buffet it doesn t look too good but they make an a ok congee no donuts unfortunately reasonably good roast duck pork and the fish maw soup is also very nice It s near my work and I like coming here for a late lunch when it s not crowded The interior is kind of beat drop ceiling battered furniture etc but I really like the laid back atmosphere This is my favorite place for a secret 90 minute leisurely lunch on a weekday with friends and sharing a few dishes Just arrive after 1pm 
3Alivwef_atDoRNZDhdYfw CMU If you like thin New York style pizza this is the place to go The slices are huge The dining area was clean and the people working there were friendly and helpful It was probably one of the best slices of pizza I ve gotten in Pittsburgh Believe me I ve eaten a lot of pizza 
3AmE8bFv2EEZPJ0D9ZRU0Q CMU I haven t eaten here since they moved locations but I am surprised at how many people rate this place as 5 stars Sure you can get a sushi roll for 4 but it has 15 micrograms of fish in it These were the smallest rolls I have ever seen anywhere Come on people I know Pittsburgh doesn t have much Asian cuisine but when you ve tasted the nectar of real sushi you ll realize how much this place doesn t compare Then update your review My friend and I were completely disappointed when we ate here Plus the service was horrible that night 
3aozkaXNQX4Cpbah3JqoTw CMU Out of my three day 3 state bar crawl this was my favorite bar Service was good the beer selection wasnt amazing but okay and they had shuffle board But what sold me was the Silky s had that homey feel to it 
3ASyX-fKAhHuOhT_IWRO_g CMU This place is a dump I guess if you really want to go to a hookah cafe and can t make it over to hookah bookah this has to be your only choice I think it s dirty and overpriced If you are coming into the city for a hookah lounge just do yourself and your group a favor and stay away from this one Take a ride down to E Carson and go to Hookah Bookah Much better 
3b2ebIafYE1c3DOXyFMtPg CMU Uncle Sams used to be a major part of my diet I lived right around the corner The subs are good but tend to induce comas and heart attacks The bread is nice and generally the ingredients are fresh The inside is clean and friendly The only real complaint I have is that most of the subs all taste the same maybe it s the shared grill which isn t bad just boring 
3BJfMSecJqtFuIQVrxnYfw CMU I was here today for lunch Our waitress was brand new and so we had to be a little patient but she was very friendly and will catch on quickly That said I have no complaints about the service but the food was not anything to write home about I ve eaten here a few times in the past and I recommend going with one of their top sellers noted on the menu they seem to be top sellers for a reason Deviating from those doesn t pay off But they do have outdoor seating and it is a great place for people watching 
3c1yP93FdZOh7SaNtwaZUA CMU One of my favs in pgh I usually get girasole salad with chicken but they have seasonal specials and it is just an awesome place 
3cL1VzM07QxyBKXRcxrITA CMU I ve never been to F F for the late night half price food but have been there a couple times for dinner and drinks The beer selection is awesome I personally love the fire baked brie which comes out nice and warm and has honey drizzled all over it When you cut the breading the cheese just melts out I m a big fan of the Porky s Revenge Pizza and the Filler Up pizza The burgers are decent and I usually get the sweet potato fries with them because they are so much better than regular fries Overall a good place to eat If you do want to go for half price late night special make sure you get there early because there is usually a line outside 
3CtYULgHhN-MXus_QoNA0A CMU Strolling around Pittsburgh for my first time every and this was the place I arrived at thanks for the recommendation fellow Yelpers The service was very friendly and attentive The manager owner was also extra nice The fried mozzarella with balsamic vinegar was an interesting touch I had never seen before The balsamic added a little more fun and flavor to what s normally a pretty standard dish The gnocchi with prosciutto and white wine sauce was very delicious but a little heavy for me The bread served before the appetizers was bland and uninteresting The olive oil had some peppers and spices in it that I didn t care for The atmosphere was very intimate and charming with dark lighting and small eating areas The paper table settings were kinda neat they weren t too casual 
3cyJd-Jc_JjFQTPiwRfseA CMU As a Greenfield resident and the grand daughter of a Philadelphia butcher I have to support this place The food is really good and the staff is super friendly I think the perogies are one of the best in Pittsburgh and the Fredo Goombah is my fave sandwich on the menu Everything is really fresh and they actually have a really good canned soda selection I m lucky to have them right down the street 
3c_6OguTwKChp_4j4mU_QQ CMU I feel like I have to say Every time I get a sandwich here now that I know to ignore the rotisserie chicken it is completely awesome We had a bit of a weird waitress last time we were there though 
3d4ih51RCg4_HVpA-RULdA CMU Good quality good price Not very spicy Cute waitress 
3dJqBRcMTKrzA9vVGqrxBA CMU Ahhh Waffallonia The stuff dreams are made of I had eagerly been awaiting the opening of Waffallonia for months as I had heard they would be serving liege style waffles Having seen several glowing reviews about them throughout several publications they were certainly hyped up quite a bit before I finally went I finally made it out for a mini Squirrel Hill Day aka Diabetes Day a trip that consisted of Rita s Waffallonia and bubble tea and indulged myself in some incredible Belgian dessert waffles Waffallonia certainly lived up to the hype Their waffles are slightly crispy on the outside as they have a caramelized exterior and a soft warm interior I got a waffle with Biscoff and whipped cream both of which slowly melted into the crevices and into my heart Seeing as this was the first time I d ever had Biscoff spread I was INSTANTLY HOOKED To this day I go to Waffallonia on a regular basis just to buy a jar of the stuff Only setback is that it s REALLY tiny with very few seats Then again I kind of find that sort of thing cozy and urban Don t worry the prices are decent and it never gets too crowded 
3EhTpK18c7G3f2CMYVQxDg CMU Gyros baba ganoush falafel baklava were all excellent Will definitely visit again 
3epA4He7OjHrHUIicI761w CMU What makes Qdoba better than Chipotle You can get queso on your burrito Seriously Chipotle why no queso That seems pretty standard to me Qdoba is just a chain and it s owned by McDonald s Despite both of these issues their burritos are just awesome Simply effing delicious And filling to boot 
3Er-IaRcV9BgDcqCwHCLOQ CMU BEST place i ve eaten in Pittsburgh in years The service was great try to sit near the back of the restaurant it s cozier The menu was local fresh and delicious i had a steak my husband had fish and chips and our other guest gluten free and vegetarian had a personally created dish that she loved the dessert was great except for that it slipped off of its pedestal as it was being served it was repaired and it was in the end a funny moment they do french press coffee for dessert a nice signature item i would eat here everyday if i could afford to do so definitely check it out 
3eTfDmHO2tpa58GHbIIU1w CMU I love this place mostly because it means I don t have to deal with the oversaturation of bars in the South Side The squirrel cage as some affectionately call it really is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh because it s a little dive y but still hip and has nice booths to sit in where you can just get a cheap pitcher or two and chill with your buds It s also great for people watching 
3e_Pp9StwyQ-WxujFiunwg CMU Thursday night Bites and Brews was buzzing with business My friends and I stood in the doorway shifting our weight uncertain of what to do No one had greeted us Do we seat ourselves we asked a waitress as she rushed past us Uh yeah she shot over her shoulder So we seated ourselves And then the same waitress came over to our table Can I get you something to drink Umm We paused Maybe a nanosecond too long Your options are on the chalkboard she spat and probably would have added idiots to that statement if she hadn t wanted a tip Oh uh She stared at us her eyes nervously glancing around the restaurant Something was up After a minute we ordered drinks and then took a look at the checklist menu a novel idea for a restaurant that is ostensibly DIY The drinks arrived We finished our checklists The waitress whisked the checklists away to the kitchen And that s when the minutes whisked away too Ten minutes Twenty minutes Thirty minutes Forty minutes A different waitress buzzed by us Then our waitress Then another one Suddenly there seemed to be eighteen waitresses in the restaurant We stopped one Where was our food She looked at us and her eyes shifted over to the kitchen There in front of the restaurant a waitress was hollering at a cook What do you mean you flipped it she screamed They ve been waiting forever The argument shifted locations to the front of the bar to doorway to the back kitchen then back to the floor It was a Battle Royale Our ersatz waitress glanced back at us Uh there s a bit of a problem in the kitchen tonight So she brought us another round of beer After an hour our food arrived It was okay Not great Certainly not wait for an hour great or even wait for an hour good at that But it was food And we were hungry And with the exception of our first round of drinks the entire bill was comped So Win win I guess 
3FjYs5JCeCvCSIZ2xJgQbw CMU Awesome place Small friendly super cheap and super big portions The appetizer eggplant is large enough to serve as a meal with some left over for tomorrow s lunch 
3FLszYxuXrxgGN34mdNElQ CMU I wish I could give it 4 and a half stars instead of just 4 But anyway This place has been around for a while now I am surprised it was able to stay in business considering how many other businesses have gone under on the same street The food is really really good It s Thai but also sort of Malaysian or something I am not 100 on that But it s definitely Thai and maybe something else There is a lot of seafood used in their dishes and same with fruit and spicy flavors Whoever came up with a lot of the appetizers really knows how to blend flavors together harmoniously To drink I always order either mango juice Thai Iced Tea or hot floral tea To eat my favorite dish is the Siam Paragon This is also my mom s favorite And I would like to point out that she does not even LIKE Thai food and she loves to eat here Their coconut rice is TO DIE FOR It s SO tasty and sweet almost like a dessert I ve also tried Haw Moork Fish Salmon Rolls Spring Rolls and the Spicy Siam Mussels on the half shell I am sure I ve tried a few other of their tapas too but it s been a while so the names aren t coming to me as I type this But basically it s all really good A lot of dishes have some spiciness to them so if you don t like spicy foods then you might wanna steer clear or play it safe and order something not so spicy like spring rolls or pad Thai I ve had their Red Curry with chicken and their chicken Pad Thai Both are really tasty The mildest level for the red curry is still a little bit spicy though The tapas are the best though and if you are undecided try the Siam Paragon and the Spring Rolls with chicken or veggies if you prefer Those are both tried true dishes I ve never really tried their alcoholic drinks so I can t comment on those or the desserts I REALLY love their interior too Easily one of the most romantic interiors in town or at least in the Sq Hill area The lighting decor and the waterfall by the door all very nice for a night out Regarding the prices pretty affordable if you order 3 4 appetizers and split among you and one other person or more My mom and I spent about 35 total for the both of us including a tip for our meal and we were pretty filled two mango juices coconut rice side order siam paragon mussels on the half shell spring rolls and salmon rolls The only reason why the Silk Elephant did not get 5 5 stars is due to the service It can be really really REALLY slow in there sometimes even when there aren t many other people eating there Once you place your order it seems to speed up a bit though 
3fvlOaVNHerW1qPJEs5QdA CMU What was supposed to be Pad Thai ended up being some bland noodles drowned in a big mess of bean sprouts and tofu and may be oyser sauce Fishy more chum than Pad Thai Chicken Noodle dish was mushy and reeked of rancidity and fish stock as well Food order came in after no more than 2 minutes of placing the order I really was wondering if he mixed our order with someone else s Anyway gave the usual tip because waitress was pleasent but not going back 
3GUi-Y8YmMHoBpqjQ4NCYQ CMU We went tonight with our 2 year old daughter and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner We shared the appetizer sampler and the dips were fresh with great pita We also ordered a small Greek salad which was large enough to share with a tasty fresh cheese and a nice light vinaigrette Right now there aren t many entrees but my wife ordered the traditional shish kabob and I had the chicken kabob platters These came with more salad on the side and were also good For dessert we tried the pistachio wrap which was warm and delicious They also added a new rice pudding which was wonderful with a nice hint of citrus and just the right amount of cinnamon The service was friendly and attentive and they were clearly happy to have a young toddler We noticed a steady stream of take out traffic as well We will definitely go back again 
3gv9LKjWMZbRJZIeGisFrg CMU They changed the menu up a lot recently taking some of my favorites off of it though they claim that I can still get it by ordering the specific ingredients It s not the same Downstairs has normal tables upstairs is a bar they claim the downstairs is open til 9pm every day but they usually close it by 7 Upstairs you can order off the menu til 11 and it s 21 after 10 They have pool and darts but it s not great for atmosphere 
3gY5aBnd3eYZU4RLojXhZQ CMU I was looking forward to visiting Legume because of its great reviews but was really underwhelmed For starters my friend and I the crudite appetizer The selection of vegetables was interesting but for the amount that were on the plate more of the dipping sauce would have been nice I was surprise by ALL OF THE LAMB on the menu but visited the website once I was back home and realized that there s a relationship with a butcher that involves lamb Still three lamb entrees while there s no chicken and other obvious proteins is a little weird Also the lamb was not prepared that well What was really disappointing though were the two dead fruit flies in my Four Roses The waiter actually returned to the table after taking my drink back to the bar to ask me if I still wanted the Four Roses why was there something wrong with it They brought a replacement but I was surprised I wasn t comped for the drink Also by definition this place is not a bistro but whatever I really wanted to like this place With the exception of the drink containing dead bugs the wait staff was great and I did think they had a nice selection of wines 
3H0WWG7eKDtyX232KFQm9w CMU Ok I know what people are going to say How could you give The Porch only 3 stars Went here for brunch today and the meal had two sides the really good and the bad What we sampled Farm Bread with honey butter apple butter and blueberry preserves Today s farm bread was homemade english muffins and the order came with 2 whole english muffins The muffins were delicious especially enhanced with the different butters and preserves Bianca Pizza Fig Jam Goat Cheese Mozzarella Arugula Truffle oil This was my order and I was pretty disappointed I love all of the things that this pizza promised but I don t think that it delivered Overall the pizza had way to much fig jam and the taste was overwhelming and I wasn t able to taste the other flavors Burger Roasted Red Peppers Caramelizied Onions and a Fried Egg on a Brioche Bun This burger was awesome The burger was cooked rare though we requested medium rare but it was so good it didn t matter Also the egg was perfectly cooked This was messy and delicious in all the right ways Cast iron pork belly Possibly the most disappointing dish of all It was a small cast iron skillet with 10 small chunks of pork belly that were so overcooked they were almost impossible to eat I would probably return for dinner to see what they are able to do but I don t know about brunch The service was good and our waitress fulfilled every request that we had The place was bustling with small and large groups and the noise level was moderate I also liked the decor and the towels for napkins 
3h8xSndUf9lwggWXAt9Jug CMU Doc s is a decent place in the Spring and Summer when their 2nd floor upstairs patio is open They have reasonably priced pitchers of beer and well drinks It s nice to sit outside and relax after a long day of school or work The beer selection isn t that great and the upstairs bar is not full Sometimes their drink specials are served in tiny plastic cups The service can also be rather slow I am not a big fan of their food pizzas are bland and the burgers overcooked although it is nice to split an appetizer with a group of people 
3HYelLNiRYkGOyMlr41B2g CMU I used to be a regular at Harris Grill until I moved a bit further away but I still try to return for the I Can Haz Bacon Cheesburger and Bacon night Where else can you go on a Tuesday and order a side of bacon with your meal While Harris isn t the only place in Pittsburgh where you can get your drinks delivered to you by a cute hipster waitstaff it certainly has one of the widest best beer selections in the city I ve also heard tell that the frozen cosmos are quite good 
3IFiQt5xjSfFmtmz86B9Gg CMU A Shadyside staple this place is great for lunch while shopping Walnut dinner or late night Last night my friends and I stopped here and it was at it s usual capacity upstairs and downstairs with decent music playing It s a good local bar nothing too crazy going on and good for a final stop before heading home 
3iH3II21ouXaTQaDN1dT0w CMU For my 100th review I m taking it back home Girasole is a lovely little italian restaurant tucked away in a basement on Copeland Street They have outdoor seating that is secluded from all the hustle and bustle on Walnut Street so it s definitely ideal for a date in the summer Our service was wonderful and the waitstaff was incredibly attentive My friend and I split a bottle of chianti and started off with some delicious escarole and beans The escarole was still slightly al dente and was swimming in a pool of beans with garlicy plump fresh tomatoes We asked for extra bread twice to sop up all of the juicy goodness We also split the bruschetta which came styled with ricotta cheese It was also delicious I picked the spinach and ricotta ravioli which were large little pillows of warm goodness I think there were only 4 but they were huge and also swimming in another delicious sauce The herbs were so fresh and delightful in this dish Everything at Girasole is rustic and bursting with flavor Anytime I m home I come back for an enjoyable meal in the sun Classic Italian food 
3IIZxw-PS7fqkRPAq4qX1A CMU The boy and I were visiting his brother and sister in law who have recently moved to Pittsburg During our day long visit to the Carnegie Museums we decided to stop and have lunch here rather than wander the city looking for food The boy had the steak sandwich which he said was a little greasy but yummy I had the petite salad and mushroom soup it came with a cute little bread bun The salad was prettily presented but the carrot curlicues were very challenging to eat gracefully The soup was very good and the combo only cost 5 We sat by the window which presented a nice view of the fountain and the street 
3IujN2K4EedrfFUJ_dWPcQ CMU I can understand why some people might love this place but it just wasn t for me I had a Groupon and decided to try it out for dinner on a Friday night with the boyfriend I made a reservation but the restaurant wasn t crowded at all The menu was simple with a lot of delicious sounding dishes none of which were vegetarian The pasta of the day was a seafood pasta so that wouldn t work either I asked the waiter what he recommended thinking he might be able to work something out with the pasta but no such luck He suggested soup a salad and a vegetable We both ordered the special soup potato leek a salad with goat cheese and a side of asparagus and green beans I had a 10 glass of Malbec which was pretty decent We started off with some crostinis and butter followed by the soup which was delicious Our salad and vegetables came out next Everything was done very well especially the goat cheese which came baked on bread with the salad The service was just okay Our waiter was super attentive at first then we didn t see him at all after he took our order Our food was brought out by 2 different people our water filled by another and still another brought our check over Nobody came by to see how our meal was or ask if we needed anything I probably won t return given the limited menu options for myself The bar area looked nice so maybe I ll stop in for a glass of wine in the future 
3j-bT_0Us5t7fE_68iFDAQ CMU Four words bring me to Gullifty s Kenny Blake improv night Kenny will jam for a bit on sax with the band then invite whoever brought an instrument to join in Any jazz night in Pittsburgh will have high standards due to the city s rich history in the genre and Kenny never disappoints It s always an interesting experience As far as food goes the cobb salad has been consistently good and all of the fried appetizers are as good as any diner s I don t eat sweets often so I can t speak for the so called famous desserts Others have complained about the decor but I find the hideousness of it somehow charming 
3j4UQBduNU7jXvBCJoK5rQ CMU I ve noticed this place while driving to the South Side via Greenfield Ave One evening the boyfriend and I were looking for a bite to eat but neither of could decide where to go On a whim I pulled up to Szmidt s and man I m glad I did The aroma of all the spices and fresh bread when you walk in the door is intensely pleasing The deli case is filled with various fresh pasta salads and sides that include grape leaves pickled cucumber slices mac n cheese with jalapeno apricot glazed meatloaf potato salad tuna salad haluski looked amazing I will definitely be back to try it and various other items that evade my memory at the moment Have I mentioned that everything is made in house Breads salads sides and pierogies ALL home made Speaking of pierogies all your classics are here Potato cheddar potato kraut potato jalapeno sausage and plain kraut 4 95 6 8 95 12 In addition to these are New World Pierogies 5 45 6 9 95 12 Reuben thanksgiving with turkey gravy southwest chicken with cilantro lime sour cream buffalo chicken with bleu cheese cheese steak with horseradish sour cream and bacon cheeseburger with rage sauce They also offer sweet pierogies like apple mango granny smith apple pie and a seasonal special So much deliciousness in one place we didn t know where to begin After thinking long and hard I finally decided on a spinach feta doughbie think stromboli and Justin opted for the Frankie sliced turkey breast ginger mustard glazed ham maplewood bacon american cheese mayo lettuce and tomato all on a toasted homemade bun While our food was being prepared we chatted with the owner I told him we ve been living here for a year now and can t believe we never heard of his place then he informed us that they just opened up a month ago and offered us some samples from the deli case We had a little scoop of potato salad better than my mom s sorry ma 4 grape leaves the best I ve had and I do love me some dolmas sweet cucumber slices JB was a huge fan and now wants me to try my hand at recreating them at home so he can have them all the time and ziti pasta salad which is great WITH the cuke slices Everything we had was exquisite The entire experience was pleasurable The shop owner was personable and inviting the shop is darling and homey with pictures of the family hung on the walls and the food is delectable and very affordable Sorry for such a lengthy review but I just can t say enough good things about Szmidt s If you happen to find yourself in the Greenfield Squirrel Hill area do yourself a favor and give this place a chance 
3JswcgV_MZg--az3bTo7Fw CMU Best sushi I ve had in Pittsburgh The white tuna was great The portions are very small so we kept ordering more and more dishes as we ate 
3kBfvZKxuVKRF68CFUTthg CMU My husband and I adore this place Despite having been incredible fans of Dozen we had them cater our wedding brunches we never went to their Squirrel Hill location But then we discovered Waffalonia and go pretty much once a week It is the perfect opportunity to go on a short walk and eat some absolutely delicious waffles I actually don t mind the seating I don t think the store owners really intend for the restaurant to be a place where you hang out indefinitely with your friends Could it be that Sure But by depriving you of proper seating options which btw I can t say has ever bothered me my husband and I hang out in there with no problems whatsoever they make you focus on what s important and that is how freaking delicious their offerings are My husband and I talk until we get the waffles and then there s just silent munching and mooning over the waffles until they are all gone And then we start talking again usually about how awesome the waffles are and how glad we are that there s a place like this in Squirrel Hill Just as a funny side note for those of us who grew up in the 80s try to think of the Animaniacs song but with Waffalonia instead 
3KMsvJmgdI9ZY3aIu5CA0A CMU This is a cute place to stop to grab a bite to eat We ate here for a tiny snack after our Phipps flower trip so I cannot fully rate the place because all we got was a Hummus wrap and a green been salad However they were both delicious I loved my green beans There were onions and cranberries within the green bean salad which added a very delicious part to the plate The atmosphere of this place is also fantastic It is very trendy and clean One can see the cleanness based off the fact there is 5 different kinds of cans for garbage Very cool and very trendy I wish more places were like this I want to come back here and actually have a real lunch so I can actually have a good opinion but based on what I experienced I would definitely come back 
3l2gBOvvjUr-F-z-N2Z3Fg CMU I ve never been to the one in Oakland But there IS one in the Southside which is great The space is open and has really clean lines The staff is always super nice I just had my birthday dinner there a couple of weeks ago The fact that it is BYOB is fantastic too Jamesons and wine woo I am a big fan of Middle Eastern food The gyro yee rro meat doesn t seem processed and isn t greasy like most places Yes roll those r s rrr The dish that keeps me coming back is the hummus madamas The chick peas are whole with lemon juice olive oil cilantro i think tomatoes etc Healthy and refreshing dish The platters are great especially the kebabs and cuts of lamb The lamb is always cooked really well with absolute tenderness I m not a big fan of the chicken though I remember it being a tad dry Considering I was down six shots of irish whiskey and four ipa s I can t recall too well It s a great environment for large groups or even an initmate date 
3Lie0rrPAx0RvCpEx9oh0w CMU I love this place because it is consistently a 5 star restaurant Every time you walk through the door you know that you will be having an absolutely superb meal The servers are perfectly attentive without being overbearing They re knowledgeable friendly and pleasantly enthusiastic The food is always fresh well matched flavors and they love to use simple ingredients that create a well balanced course Did I mention their dessert is absolutely to die for Oh coffee too I cannot wait to try the spring menu I ll definitely be bringing a nice bottle of wine and relaxing for awhile 
3n-0DB0jA6T4qUL-bCo7tw CMU Another one of my favorite escape from Pittsburgh locations This small Thai restaurant off the beaten path of Forbes Ave and looking pretty ghetto from the outside is one of the coolest places for dinner in whole city If you like tea and I do they have an entirely separate tea menu with a fairly large collection Also you can never ever ever go wrong with the Ice Tea of the Day So awesome Almost all the food is good here however my favorites were the singapore night noodles the pad thai i know and my all time winner the chicken with string bean which actually comes with more than one string bean As mentioned this place is BYOW and many people do You get an eclectic crowd of college students professors and other academic types mixed in with some curious locals It s all pretty affordable too 
3n1FQU5hcie08KXyP7JHJA CMU Noodles Company is a chain restaurant yes but as far as I m concerned it s a welcome addition to the available array of Oakland eateries It s kind of like Chipotle for noodles you pick from a menu that has menu noodle dishes that fall into American Asian or Mediterranean categories I have tried a couple different things here and so far everything has been pretty good The Penne Rosa is definitely my favorite The only downside is that the restaurant is ALWAYS packed and pretty loud but things move quickly even so If you re in Oakland and feel like you ve tried everything around stop here You won t be sorry 
3NAqabPCZ67Tt9Q8azdh7w CMU This place is fantastic The owner greeted us as we walked in as did several other patrons this was our first visit and they made us feel like regulars It s a small place but the easy sense of community prevents one from feeling cramped The owner asked us for feedback as we ate rather than how do you like it which I appreciated And my feedback was this is delicious Can I move in I would gladly live in their basement if I could smell that pastrami every day I had their version of a Reuben housemade everything even the bread Excellent decision on my part My fianc had their Szmidt sandwich to which he added a fried egg This is an option on any of their sandwiches They ll also make you any combination sandwich you like Their pierogies are very popular and I cursed myself for having eaten breakfast hours earlier as that bowl of cereal prevented me from being able to order some of their dessert pierogies So go to Szmidt s I ll see you there 
3NfxR-Gq4AmtYrpG2seE7g CMU Nom Nom Nom Nom This place is delightful As a hardcore Thai fan I frequently shun Chinese food Mostly because I feel the bland ameri chinese is greasy and unsatisfying This place however blew me away with their authentic Sichuan food Who knew Chinese food was this good Damn those restaurants that try to placate the American palate The millions of dried red chillies that were scattered through a pan of flaming fish calling to me with their flavorful spicy and tender meat that had layers and layers of flavor This place is just around the corner from us so we ll definitely be keeping it as a go to Tip You ll have to ask for the Sichuan menu they won t automatically give it to you Also the servers will give you plenty of tips on what is good and what are the most popular dishes that people order 
3Nhj2XcR1OJCnN9aPIY3HA CMU Ahh PHI bar my bar A true dive bar with a mix of locals and CMU kids slumming it together and sometimes to hilarious effects The beer is cheap the pizza greasy and the fries crunchy I love the specials such as 4 Yuengling pitchers on Thurs and 6 Blue Moon pitchers on Wednesday The pints aren t too expensive either especially the Yuengling The bar tenders can seem a bit cold until you start chatting them up and then they give you all sorts of under the counter specials Be wary of Friday nights which is 1 well drinks and the place resembles the black hole of Calcutta with beggars traded out for frat boys in polos and flip flops The minimum for credit cards is 10 but there is an ATM around the corner so never fear and I always order more than that anyway 
3NLzZTxqeB10lL5ZWd4qWQ CMU Well my update has half of my original rating Not because of their food but because of the service My friend booked her birthday party there this past Saturday night in their tavern room When we got there the room that was supposed to be set up for her party and guests was completely full of other restaurant patrons She had called in advance to confirm party details and they assured her that everything would be fine Not the case when we got there The person she set the party up with wasn t working that night and it took the hostess 15 minutes to find his note that was left about the party It took another hour for them to clear somewhat of an area for the party which was now squeezed into the bar area The whole area never fully got cleared out for her party and we had to share space with people who they had sat in that hour that we had waited for it to clear out They also put only one server on staff which was insanity and chaos because there were 30 of us at this party I think she got 1 out of every 4 drink orders correct I would still go here to eat for dinner but I would never recommend it to anyone looking to have a party or event here 
3OCqp1Bo7UoiL_dhnKMqBQ CMU I ve had some of the best loose leaf tea here I ve had mixed luck with the food one dinner was excellent whereas a lunch seemed too salty Definitely better to eat here rather than take out as I think the take out suffers For what it s worth they do have beer and wine I m not super excited about this place but I would probably go back if others wanted to go i e I doubt if I would choose it myself again 
3OXEm-fPpZ4DQ9dwgRyG6g CMU You only come here for one reason the 5 large cheese pizza It s carry out only and anyone who lives within a 4 block radius of this place knows all about this The pizza isn t that great but if it s midnight you re piss drunk and need some food this is where you come 
3Oyt3E1BWDIO0-eEV8od0A CMU Shaved ice is one of my favorite Taiwanese treats but unlike bubble tea or Taiwanese savory snacks or dim sum it s harder to to find in the U S Stores that focus on shaved ice are rare even in cities like NYC and LA This is why I m thrilled that a shaved ice place opened up within walking distance to my home But first let me back up a step here Shaved ice is basically a plate of finely grated ice with syrups condensed milk and additional toppings such as sweet red beans fruit etc It s like a more fanciful snow cone for a more international take on the same basic concept see http www nytimes com 2010 06 16 dining 16ice html pagewanted all What I liked about the newly opened Cool Ice Taipei they make a satisfying plate of snow ice that is their machine produces ice shavings with a finer fluffier texture than what you get from a coarse hard snow cone CIT offers several flavored ice base milk matcha Japanese green tea or fruit The toppings are sweet but not overly so I wish that the menu were a bit broader for example it d be nice if they d let customers pick their own toppings rather than offering just eight standard sets most of the standard sets have just one or two toppings I also wish that the prices were lower an albeit large plate will run you between 6 50 8 50 CIT also offers a variety of tea drinks and some savory Taiwanese dishes I ve not yet had the chance to try but they ve at least piqued my interest In terms of its space the store could have used a bit more remodeling rather than just inherit everything from Pamela s The vibe feels a bit off In that respect CIT could have taken a pointer or two from its neighbor Rose Tea Cafe Overall CIT did not disappoint They may have a few more wrinkles to work out in the interim I hope they succeed 
3oZQyluDNKqQL6wwZSYHyw CMU Classy place low lighting and candlelit white clothed tables I got the crispy spelt dish I asked for no cheese which was this layered entree of savory spelt crackers and sauteed greens every component was delicious and the dish overall was a good balanced of flavor and texture and seasoned well Sticking to the veg dishes about 15 makes this restaurant a very deliciously affordable upscale experience Highly recommended 
3pf1Ng-yGWj2bxM2cbf9IQ CMU This is a pretty good quality Indian I didn t have the buffet but I ordered off the menu I had the lamb vindaloo with an onion kulcha the vindaloo was spicy and sour as I expected 
3QETU8ow3V3leHa4feoHuw CMU Don t be deceived by the nondescript PAMELA S RESTAURANT sign in the sketchy font out front The interior of this place is cozily modern and the food is fantastic Home fries cooked to a mealy perfection then smashed before frying in order to maximize their crisp able surface area They must put some kind of cheese in them to get it that lovely golden brown color and perfectly crunchy texture Hotcakes kind of like a thick crepe but better Each bite is different sometimes sweet sometimes a little saltier fruitier other times crunchier Delicious every single time Omelettes Their egg white omelettes do a great job posing as normal eggs The fillings are fresh and flavorful without overpowering the flavor of the egg Toast Yes even their toast is excellent Crisp on the outside soft and fluffy on the inside And their toast comes pre buttered taking care of that pesky cold butter on hard toast problem It s greasy spoon brunch fare at its very best My parents ate here two days in a row which says a lot because they re Asians from Asia and typically don t like greasy American style brunch foods I m an Asian from America and typically don t like to agree with my parents but I ll make an exception for Pamela s This place is amazing 
3Qxey1kw_vVoDV_lMSq1Lw CMU Istanbul is full of friendly and attentive staff that honestly seem like they enjoy what they are doing The food was fresh hot and delicious It also helps that it won t bust your budget if you enjoy yourself and have an appetizer dinner and desert Just don t forget your own wine This place is definitely on my list if I want to grab a quick dinner for take out on my way home 
3rYHES8dgWy3yv2KpZkS1w CMU Woah Thank goodness for yelp That s how I learned about this breakfast gem The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast but before I did I did a quick Yelp search We headed to Pamela s as soon as I saw the reviews There were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down Here s my only complaint We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line which was a bit rude The seating is tight but the atmosphere diner esque Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art some for sale no less The menu while not particularly health conscious was heavy on eggs and pancakes We went with the specialty pancakes banana walnut and choc chip Both were delicious I really wanted to and tried to finish mine but I just couldn t man up The other complaint which is of no fault of the restaurant was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene Despite the deliciousness of the food things got tense for a while I think the next time I have a serious pankcake hankering I ll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela s 
3Td3gFki2Ii2Ex-ysM9FKA CMU Massive servings friendly folks First timer Decent meal all around I had the Reuben one of my favorite sandwiches so I had to try it here Great big tasty bread toasted not grilled yummy kraut and cheese But the corned beef well they didn t cook it there Must have come in with the rest of the cold cuts Not the reubens I m used to I will come by for the veal parm though There s enough quality to bring me back 
3tVaImCSZQf-zfTo9C3zkg CMU I have been to Red Oak Cafe twice in the last two weeks The first time was hands down great and just to make sure it wasn t a fluke I returned again for lunch Red Oak Cafe gets insanely busy during peak lunch times and rightfully so This gem makes home style food in a healthy and affordable way I ve gotten a turkey sandwich and the roasted pepper sandwich with the home made chips I wish I was eating some right now Portions are good and you won t leave hungry Red Oak Cafe is definitely a keeper though street parking can be a pain 
3TYlcSTiaIIrJC5fyqYC3Q CMU We went to Silk Elephant after partaking in a movie Ordered the Mussels and discovered it came with 2 mussels and all filler I requested a second order without the filler Literally a single bowl of 2 mussels came out For the prices portions even considering it s tapas are pathetic 
3uCQfq2-NBxSfrh4TZ9AUw CMU I ve been going to the star of india for years so I was eager to try this new indian restaurant which just opened up in it s place Yuva did not disappoint The staff was knowledgeable and friendly Yuva had new massive photographs of Indian spices decorating the walls They had a huge selection and everything was delicious and homemade My only complaint was the price for the small entree portions did not seem like a good value to me The 16 entree portions were just small bowls They were very tasty but I expected more That said the appetizer sampler and naan bread sampler were very reasonably priced and generous To get a good value I d skip the entrees entirely and stick purely to the appetizers and sides doing that I would gladly come back to Yuva again 
3uRPweA4K6AAypBjKZsGgA CMU Made reservations on a busy Saturday night 3 5 for me and my girlfriend it was our first time eating out in Pittsburgh out of towners and Soba exceeded my expectations coming from SoCal where there s Asian fusion joints everywhere The Coat Check for ladies and free parking was awesome the tandoori grilled salmon was impeccable and this place is getting 5 Stars from me mainly for its outrageously delicious and homemade Soba banana split That s right homemade chocolate roasted pineapple and jasmine green tea ice cream scoops on top of banana cake and creme bruleed crunchy bananas Best dessert we ve ever had Speciality drinks were pretty outstanding too thanks Soba 
3VOCMaL7EbnXw40iASM5qg CMU I had the chicken and fries here It s a little pricier than my spot back in DC but that s okay because I assume this is the only choice here in Pitt Chicken was okay not the best I ve had and the fries were a nice fresh cut surprise They were like beach fries with sea salt but a little greasy I went to reach for an Inca soda pineapple is my fav and I looked around and saw that they don t have a commercial cooler just a beach cooler with no ice just drinks Odd I d go back if I m craving the chicken but it s just okay Worth trying at least once 
3vOiSrk0zVvzdQMMzjHM8w CMU I ve been in Pittsburgh this past weekend for the first time in four years so my two visits to the Harris Grill recently were the only ones I ve made since it burned down a few years back Prior to that I lived in Pittsburgh and ate at the Harris Grill at least a couple times each month Fortunately not much has changed in the time I ve been gone Sure there are a few new things on the menu and some of the old items are gone but as always the draft beer list rocks the servers are awesome the food is fantastic and the clientele is fabulous I think my girlfriend and I broke open the front porch for the year on Friday as we sat alone in the chill Spring afternoon eating amazing hummus and drinking beers and cocktails We won t be back again at least until the end of June so Harris employees please keep the seats warm and the beer cold 
3vU3_dQP2qEzfg9lRJb4Hw CMU The only other choices you have if you want a sandwich in the area are Quiznos and Subway so they have an advantage right there but they re still pretty looks there s some nice soup options and they have a pretty decent vegetarian menu as well Some things I like here are the Pesto Chicken Sandwich the Southwest Sizzler and the Summer Sandwich 
3VVP2JwvpK7t46yRTSfk1g CMU Peter s is a pretty unassuming bar in the heart of Oakland How exactly did I find myself here It just so happens to be the home of the Pittsburgh Browns Backers Last Thursday I found my way to the second floor where I was greeted by a group of Cleveland transplants such as myself We had a fantastic time watching our team play And while the Browns lost as expected I had a great time The service at the bar was excellent friendly and prompt The nachos were both cheap and quite stellar Guacamole would have been nice but nevertheless the cheese was quite sharp and packed a nice little zing Furthermore the price cannot be beat Is this a place to have a romantic dinner with your SO Of course not But if you re looking for a good perhaps sloppy time then sure Enjoy 
3vY7siePKropfF2wCER7lg CMU Bienvenue vers la France Brasserie 33 is a very charming Parisian cafe with lots of adoring repeat customers If you don t appreciate the appeal and ambiance of that you should probably stay away But this place is quintessentially French with lots of traditional French dishes Yes our waitress slipped in a couple small ways however it was her first night on the job and we ended up having a fabulous evening I ordered the Vol au Vent Au Poulet et Champignons for an appetizer and it was wonderfully dark rich and savory For the main course I had the Cassoulet which was also marvelous I topped off the evening with the Cr me Br l e and it was prepared as authentically as I have ever tasted it 
3XDoZSEqTYnKx54_aJ-ZnQ CMU This is absolutely drunk food For a 5 credit minimum you get 3 big crispy slices of plain pizza for a rounded out 5 There s also a six pack to go that is pretty price but decent The place however is really terrible looking and smelled kind of weird It apparently has a very tiny bar too Again good drunk food Probably not good sober food 
3xf3TnFoAJ45Q9HEOU6EeQ CMU I honestly thought this place was just ok Eaten a lot of falafels but not in Pittsburgh so I really cant compare with whats around The owner seemed nice and friendly There were like 3 4 falafels cut into 1 2 and lots of rice and salad and hummus the falafels werent hot they werent crunchy on the outside the flavor was ok I had to hunt the meat in the gyro but once I got to it it wasnt as salty as probably mike and tonys has it All in all it was okay I guess its the price that makes it a good deal for college students 
3XH4HTapto6PFlesdH2XOA CMU So many wonderful choices and hearty portions for the price I love their unusual flavors like honey sunflower as well as their stalwart selections like pistachio and raspberry truffle If you want a solo small be prepared to pay cash 
3Xz6XT0-d7BPqoA2Tgombw CMU Enjoyed the food staff was very welcoming and friendly and there was no wait at all Will definitely be returning 
3y7eF6NuDU1-Pk9Dvz-gqA CMU Eat Unique has a great menu full of unique sandwiches and salads that leaves Panera in the dust I finally made it out to the cafe for lunch today and had an overall good experience The only negative part of my lunch was that my girlfriend asked for American cheese on her sandwich rather than the normal bleu cheese They ended up giving her a corner of a piece of American as well as bleu cheese It s a shame that they couldn t get such a simple request right especially since we arrived at 1 30 and the lunch crowd was gone I also ordered a pecan bar and did not receive it I went back to the cashier and she gave me one Reading similar negative comments regarding accuracy with ordering makes me think it s something they should work on The food was excellent however I got the Italian sub and it was full of fresh spring greens rather than the usual shredded ice berg lettuce I also tried their white turkey chili and it was excellent as well My girlfriend managed to pick most of the bleu cheese off of her meatloaf melt and said it was really good She also had the tomato feta and basil soup and enjoyed it The pecan bar was a flaky crust a kind of dense chocolate ganache and a pecan topping similar to a pecan pie It was really good The food at Eat Unique seems to be fresh and in plentiful portions We d definitely go back I hope they get their ordering accuracy in better shape though 
3yJl6ugFOEAOOSKTP3lFiw CMU I loved this place amazing pizzas great drinks good atmosphere Until I experienced an incident involving a mouse We had paid our bill and were just waiting to leave when a mouse suddenly scurried across the window sill above our booth and across to where my friends were sitting We all flew up and out of the booth in reaction to this Our waitress came over to ask what happened and we told her Her reaction was slow She casually walked back to get the manager All he did was say he was sorry No refund or anything was offered and I felt like I was being interrogated to find out where the mouse was This was the worst experience ever at what used to be one of my favorite places to go and I will never return 
3Yq-s6jngSsVzo13uYiplw CMU Had a nice dinner here on a Sunday evening and was surprised that the restaurant provided live entertainment in the form of Thai dancers All the food we ordered was delicious especially the pumpkin curry which had nice large chunks of pumpkin in it As this restaurant is located on the second story the best seats are near the window looking out over Forbes Avenue The people sitting at the table next to us ordered a whole fish which was somewhat alarming to look at but apparently tasty to eat No complaints really highly recommended 
3_pfl_16ZUQ1PT3gzQE5MA CMU Meh if I m feeling generous I d give it another 1 2 star for the Italian wedding soup but my gnocchi and veal marsala were only worthy of a review to keep the exuberant reviews from getting out of hand I suppose I was expecting more out of Bloomfield I would expect this service and quality outside of Little Italy I d eat there again but it doesn t make me want to go back without trying other restaurants in the area 
4-0zX-NeCzfEx-CvULPUdQ CMU Union Grill gives Tessaro s a run for it s money for the best burger crown On the short strip of shops on Craig St Union Grill stands out It is a neighborhood restaurant very American food It isn t healthy not even the salads but that s what makes it good The service is what you expect nothing great but I haven t encountered a rude waiter During lunch expect a wait and it to take a while to get your food the grill gets crowded If you do get a reservation it is kind of annoying but they will not seat you until everyone is there so make you are prepared for that 
4-8bHRV6A7w5HuS0cGuW8Q CMU Pretty much the same as every other Chipotle which is pretty decent quality food at moderate prices Not particularly large standard burritos but enough for an average person for lunch Visiting from Seattle I don t know about the local availability of more authentic Mexican fare but everywhere else I have been have had much better and cheaper taco trucks and restaurants 
40drw311AHLrBy4Z_6OlMw CMU Our local diner for all the Oakland students The breakfasts are large and tasty especially for the price but the food really isn t anything super special That said it s a fantastic place to stop in on those late nights when you ve been out having a few and are in the mood for something greasy Service has always been friendly Biggest downside is that they only take cash but you can use the ATM they have on site if necessary 
40_OLm6PJqJj0ueyOQRkFw CMU The bento boxes are huge servings for the price which is the only thing I ve had on the menu The restaurant is small and cute and the service is very nice The food was very hot and good although not amazingly so The salad didn t have enough dressing on it We were expecting Japanese food though the menu appears to be half Korean at least The drinks are cans of soda and they serve Pepsi productts only Also they only take Visa Mastercard no Discover or American Express 
42UZbp0Ke6-G0Wx3lAFmow CMU Why oh why can t you stay open through the winter I want ice cream 
42X95kitKBcAB_aBW7I1Yw CMU I was pleasantly surprised with this Shadyside gem After living in the South Bay for two years I expected not to find many restaurants with such good quality as this sometimes even the fast food type restaurants in CA are better than sit down dinners out East But for the quality and price I left extremely satisfied Ambiance is perfect with low lighting and helpful service Crab cakes and duck hot pot are recommended as is the seaweed salad salad was crisp and light not at all slimy or chewy Crab cakes comparable to Scoma s restaurant in San Francisco although slightly more salty and smaller Serving sizes depend if you order a small plate or large plate I ordered two small plates and my husband ordered a salad and large plate and we left pleasantly full A great alternative to the HUGE portion sizes that the United States is known for We also were served a complimentary spicy cucumber salad from the chef which cleaned the palate and was incredibly fresh Menu does change daily I will most certainly return as will my husband He is hard to impress and he admitted that he did not expect such quality and service 
43CjRcOr_UcohLRS1FLprQ CMU It s hard to go wrong with the reasonable prices swank atmosphere and delicious food at this restaurant I heartily recommend the Malaysian Beef Rendang It seemed like the other dishes were hit or miss especially in the more generic Chinese Thai categories but I ll definitely be going back if just to have the Rendang again They get an extra bonus for having hard to find Malaysian food on the menu 
44DcnNU1uODvEz7gX-Pg_w CMU I ve only been here twice but was underwhelmed each time People kept telling me it was the best sushi in Pittsburgh and that s just wrong that d be Umi The sushi itself was fine but nothing special However they do have a big variety of genuinely traditional Japanese food So it s useful to go for udon etc 
46D2S-tlAe4DItyjJZPOHg CMU I don t know why I keep running into bad luck with pizza shops in Pittsburgh but it s really disheartening Pizza Romano usually has a decent veggie sub that I order when my husband is craving wings and pizza Apparently though this time that we ordered they failed to tell us that their menu had changed Instead of a medley of vegetables they gave me goopy eggplant soggy tomato cheese and some type of liquid that had made bread into soup I wouldn t even attempt to eat it I called and THEN they notified me of the change No big deal but their new menu stated that there should be eggplant tomato zuchinni and mushrooms on it I saw no mushrooms or zuchinni Also their garlic bread was weak and disgusting and tiny Not worth it I am really disappointed with our experience Needless to say we won t be ordering from there again I just hope we can find a restaurant that can provide quality when we re craving some delivery 
48ZXEoZxrJax2MWqcnTbGw CMU 4 stars for a chain pizza joint you betcha ya I m pretty picky about Pizza and let s face it most chains pizza is not very good Vocelli s is different not do they different crusts to choose from they have their gourmet pizza selection which beats all other chains hands down Plus they have always been fast and after getting pies from 2 different stores they have had good consistency 
4aIoNmEpiKICwh17nOsJNw CMU I still don t get the local attraction of Pamela s It s the place to be seen on weekend mornings but the food is mediocre at best Combine it with bad service and you get two stars I ve been 3 4 times now and the waitresses have on all visits forgotten something brought food out at weird intervals or otherwise demonstrated a lack of any sort of focus on good consistent service from the owners and or managers Do yourself a favor and hit a better brunch place for better food or just hit the Eat n Park down the street for solid brunch food with better service I really want to follow my standard rule and take another star off for not taking credit cards too but I ll be nice and keep them at two Pamela s is by no means a tiny mom and pop place so it s time for them to realize that it s not 1985 anymore Of course that would make it harder to hide revenue too 
4alt5VFLjN7qM_J1MxvVqQ CMU I finally tried their food and it was a good thing to do Descent pizza and good selection of dessert 
4aqSLYuFbFw_UByh-mcYBg CMU We dropped into here for supper on a whim and were pleasantly surprised This restaurant is in a converted house on Craig Street in Oakland It s clean and well kept with hardwood floors and maybe a dozen tables The art on the walls caught our attention right away There were two large paintings of flowers one with the anatomy of the flower below as you might find it in a biology text book They were bright and strong and a pleasure to look at while eating We took a look at the menu and I was pleased to see there was a large vegetarian section I forget the full name of my dish but it was potato cauliflower curry and it had fresh cilantro and ginger in it I ordered the medium and I wish it had been a little hotter I ordered a roti to go with it but was disappointed that it appeared to be made out of white flour though the menu said it was to be whole wheat My dinner compadres ordered channa masala and a lamb dish and some creamy vegetable curry I tried the channa masala it was okay but again could have used some kick I know what you re thinking if you like kick order HOT Well the lamb dish we got was hot uncomfortably so Apparently what we wanted is medium hot Oh well you never know on your first visit to a restaurant what they mean when they say hot This place gets four stars because the meals were fresh and the service was prompt and courteous I ll defiantly go back again and next time ask for medium hot 
4Asaakwobko5flQThCx0Hw CMU Visiting pitt to see my one and only s brother graduate we weren t invited to the honors ceremony Thankfully it was morning so I could try some breakfast foods my favorite kind of foodz Got there early so there was no wait Sat down looked at the small menu and decided on the strawberry crepe pancakes a side of potatoes and bacon When I eat breakfast I do it right ya ll Food came out quick and was delicious although the cafeteria style bacon was not my fav But the potatoes OH THE POTATOES get them Do yourself a favor The pancakes were thin but the strawberries brown sugar and whipped cream complimented them so nicely i didn t even need syrup Cash only but errbody already said that 
4aVltWLhiet_2youjuzAiA CMU First of all They were out of beer Now I know the French are known for their wine but for anyone who s ever been there they also love their beer just like me How hard would it have been to go out and buy a case before opening Secondly The portion of the wine that I had to get was a little skimpy and served in the same glass as the white wine It was also 10 That s the extent of my complaints I m sure if I had the money I might frequent the place but I do not and the photocopied menu and no wine menu made everything a little less classy 
4aXR-yW8bdfkFW2uZsrlSg CMU Creative menu Nice seating available outside Hard to believe it is owned by eatnpark 
4b0RtZQ5y8m_CjBzPlVYRw CMU this place is not great not bad just Good and for what you get with the prices kinda worth to check out Mango chicken too much taste hen shien every bite had to be mixed with white rice and wash it down with ice tea Pad Thai the best quality pad thai is usually white colored noodles this place pad thai is as red as china s flag Ginger Chicken solid very solid perfect taste to it Crab Cakes Eggrolls do not get it taste like the usual free eggrolls that come free at your corner american chinese food place Mango Tiramisu errrr why did they even call this tiramisu it looks and taste more like a two layer cake with a slab of mango on it if you read this and still get it you re a FOO oh btw the owner there is not the brighest one out there either i went with a white blonde co worker when returning our credit cards she asked which one was mine helloooOOo which one do you think has last name WANG 
4b21ocgdGRQ_z6YtrntK2A CMU I ve passed this place several times and have been meaning to go in and check it out Didn t get the chance to until an out of town friend came to visit and we were looking for a local place to grab a quick lunch The service was great very friendly staff and the food was excellent as well I got the 10 chicken cordon bleu sandwich my friend got the 10 reuben and we got a medium fry to split After half a sandwich we were both full and wrapped our sandwiches to go Later in the day we pulled them out of the fridge and stuck them in the oven to warm up for another meal they were so good possibly even better than the first halves I would definitely recommend this place for a delicious sandwich 
4b3ySHOKDiwibfEVU5cmJg CMU Squirrel Hill Cafe AKA the Cage can be a good time This is primarily a student hippy hipster old regulars and local randoms who live near here spot They sell decent priced pitchers and broadcast the games It does get incredibly packed at times A solid neighborhood bar where you can sit at the jukebox and pick the tunes you feel like head bopping to I always end up putting something on like MGMT or Florence and the Machine I get weird looks when a soulful jazzy soprano starts belting into the room I m usually in my own world at that point but you have to love those you can find any song you can think of music machines I sure do I like pulling up to the bar next to a young college bloke and ordering two fingers of bourbon neat that s always an eye opener from the Punky Brewster girl with the mouse voice sitting next to you The bartenders are attentive and so are the servers when you are sitting at the tables There is an upstairs room but the ceiling is crazy low must just be made for the Shawties I really like that the booths have such high backs so if you are having an intense conversation you can hide in there One last thing this is a smoking bar so if that bothers you don t visit your clothes will be reeking by the end of the night Cheers 
4Bn2ddAR_Tm6f7f39ZlEqw CMU Last time I was here I had an absolutely AMAZING dish some kind of pumpkin bake but unfortunately it was a special and was not available on my most recent visit However I was still very happy with my order To start we had the Torrejas de Choclo These are corn fritters and I highly recommend them They are served with 4 toppings all of which are tasty especially the guacamole but the fritters themselves are so good you can eat them plain For my entr e I had the Quinotto I enjoyed it but would have liked a little more flavor On the other hand the Sudado a fish entr e which my boyfriend ordered was full of flavor The leeks added a nice touch Service was good and it is BYOB I don t think the menu has changed much since they opened though but hopefully they will have some new options soon 
4BpqYeoOFuZP5reaPzKdbA CMU Pamela s was alongside Primanti s the place everyone said I must try when I moved here And this one really delivers The food is very reasonably priced and has a unique selection Virtually everything can come with their delicious buttery crepe pancakes which are thin and amazing or their lyonaise potatoes which are outstanding especially if you are a potato lover like myself There are a lot of other good choices like the Tex Mex omelet or the Croissant French Toast and as I said above the prices are pretty good The layout is odd and there is a lot of kitschy board games and such on the wall that kind of make it fun and different There are a few drawbacks Their hours are short and I ve not found the help to be especially attentive Not bad mind you just not especially attentive Also they only take cash which is a pain when you don t typically carry cash This place is good enough that it is usually the first stop when we have visitors from out of town 
4cpOTV54sfyOKgQ-Fd9ikg CMU Although the atmosphere is great their best quality would be the menu Our waiter informed us that it changes nightly keeping only a few fan favorites for staples One of their staples shrimp and grits Try it you must try it I was torn between a few different starters and entrees but since I chose the shrimp and grits I left happy I had chicken with a squash puree and my bf had potato soup and the hanger steak Both meals were enjoyable but next time I promise to venture out of my comfort zone and get something like the lamb which our waiter referred to as something Fred Flinstone would eat after he slides off his dinosaur with a description like that how can you resist It may be a little pricey but I d say it s worth it The service is great even the man who brought our food and took our plates struck up a conversation about the ever changing menu The cozy upstairs had fireplaces and candles and made a great environment to enjoy dinner It s definitely worth trying and just remember if you get the shrimp and grits you won t be disappointed 
4D1w1nUw4E3ECsTIXF4wLA CMU I ve eaten at various Primanti Brothers locations usually this one on Forbes but they re all pretty similar First it s a Pittsburgh institution so I definitely recommend eating here if you re only in Pittsburgh for a few days It s unique you get an unholy amount of food for pennies on the dollar In fact for total calories per dollar Primanti Brothers could compete in a national championship On the other hand you have to tell it like it is The service is horrible and when they re busy which seems like always you will stand in line forever It s pretty impersonal although it is impressive to watch the cooks It s also fun to listen to the arteries clogging all around you Just based on medical advice I would not recommend eating here more than once in your life but you should definitely eat here once 
4deH_SJic5mhCsjQ7jHbvA CMU I had a delicious apple cider margarita My friends told me that their margaritas have 5 shots in them which I didn t believe because it tasted like applesauce until I was stumbling around about half an hour later We shared some nachos which were good but that may just have been the drunk munchies but the portion was too small to be worth 6 They were stingy with the chips and it was depressing to have so much cheese sauce left and no socially acceptable way to eat it The service could have been better The inside of the restaurant is pretty small and the waitresses were really strict about who could sit down You could only sit at a table if you personally were eating food You couldn t even sit with your friend who ordered something unless you were eating it too Our waitress seemed like she wanted to get us out of there or at least away from the table as quickly as possible I understand that the place is small and tables are precious but they could have been more gracious about it That night there wasn t a line to come inside and most people there weren t eating anyway so we were standing around blocking the aisles with empty tables everywhere 
4Dm3d1Mh1BUR15-1ZJPzFA CMU This place looks like a chain you would find in any food court mall The concept however is interesting and the food is surprisingly good So you walk in and can either order any of the pasta selection or build your own That s right you get to pick the type of pasta the sauce and add on whatever you like This is great if you like to think outside of the box or like mixing up your usual order every now and then The place is priced really well I ordered the four cheese tortellini and caesar salad for 9 Yes you read that right I said 9 The thing I found most interesting about this place was that I was asked if I wanted my pasta al dente or well done I ve never been asked this question and why would you ever order your pasta well done Needless to say I ordered mine al dente and it came out just so I also tried a build your own pasta which was delightful The garlic bread was alright but when dipped in marinara sauce wow That garlic bread rose to a whole new level Also the caesar salad was MUCH better than I expected I suspect it was all the dressing I wanted more This is an express restaurant so it s not intimate It really feels like you could be in a food court mall The food comes out fast but it s a great value and the taste is pretty amazing 
4eFL205DFDtxud-h1h_zng CMU Cheap decent pizza 2am and stomach growling LITTLE NIPPER S There really isn t much more to say Little Nipper s has been there for me every time and the staff is both speedy and courteous Last week I walked from East Carson to Craig partially barefoot because I made the idiotic decision to wear 5 in heels and seeing the dimly lit OPEN sign at 2 27am was salvation I am forever yours Little Nippers 
4eFTP67Vb_O3Uf2CUwSRtw CMU Was here for Valentine s day dinner Lovely ambiance and the food is exactly what I ve expected or should I say it really doesn t matter that much in such setting ha Love the bread pudding 
4Eg7u4hrbJ-KOZOFIIpd9w CMU Yummy breakfast huge portions great price point I had an omelet I like mine a bit underdone and it was perfection My BFF had the corned beef hash The service is exceptional even when they are slammed I can see why locals love this chain place 
4epg4P5QxB3EbDSVQW9PMQ CMU Chipotle is one of my favorite eateries for a quick lunch or dinner Whether you want to eat there or get it to go it is very accommodating If you eat there the music is nice the condiments are well kept and the tables are plenty The line generally moves quickly as well The food is as good as it gets for Chipotle although eating before 9PM is a good idea since the ingredients are much fresher 
4F97HPaHIbAgFZ7HMvUN6w CMU Overall dinner at Aji Picante was an exceptional experience The food service and atmosphere were amazing I thought the corn fitters were delicious crispy on the outside and soft and smooth on the inside It came with 3 different dipping sauces that will surely satisfy all personal tastes at your table My entree was an oversized pork shank It was full of flavor but a little dry Based on what the rest of my table ordered I would say that you can t go wrong with a seafood option For dessert we shared a dulce de leche mousse that went above and beyond my expectations I will definitely be going back 
4FG0WUHpLVpTXwj0A_qkkQ CMU I am astonished at all the 4 and 5 star reviews This place is in no way shape or form extraordinary In fact I would go so far as to say it s extraordinary how un extraordinary it is I m not sure if this is a Pittsburgh thing or just that I have gotten lucky since I ve moved here but the service was HORRENDOUS I have never met anyone who cared less about his job than our server Everything a server could have done wrong poorly he did The food was greasy and unremarkable The portions were unreasonably large No human should eat that much food in one sitting I had the pierogies It was a yawn on a plate I know this is a neighborhood comfort food place but I would have preferred eating at a Denny s than here Some would say that I did not have the full experience since I did not have any of the deserts but there is no desert good enough that would make me want to go back 
4g9XbnsPJwt9S4Q-dxnCnA CMU Meh The food was fine but nothing to write home about I ll agree that the curry puffs were pretty good but they were more Indian than Thai We started with some spring rolls which were fine but not being a spring roll person I let my friend eat most of them We then got the curry puffs fried tofu and the panang curry I was not particularly fond of their fried tofu it was perfectly crispy but somehow totally bland even with the sauce that was provided The panang curry was fine too but again nothing spectacular Totally reasonable place The service is nice but the prices seem kind of high for what it is I don t think I would go out of my way to come here again 
4gJPIc63uQljC8Uk-ldBhQ CMU A solid neighborhood bar just a short walk from my workplace My coworkers and I went out here after work It s a nice little cozy environment that just has a comforting feel to it Plenty of flat screen TVs to catch the big game though not sure what their channel options are for out of town games I d have to go back to investigate Otherwise the service was solid the drink menu was decent and the food was good I had the nachos which were pretty average to slightly above average in nature The guacamole was actually good though Nothing to write home about but decent enough to enjoy And yes I m a stickler when it comes to guac Overall I m giving this place 4 stars because this is simply a cool place to chill after a long day at work Give it a try and see what you think 
4h608OxSYHOxfDWTvtBWEA CMU We are frequent diners an have been for ten years For two people try the feast and split it a great way to sample all the good stuff The rice is always very satisfying but the shrimp is hit and miss often over done Still we keep going back Love the soups and salad 
4hwpAU9aCfN8QssjJ_G7FA CMU Blueberry Cheesecake Nutella Pistachio Raspberry Black Cherry Coconut Good yes Very very good But nothing comes close to the gelato perfection of ginger Why oh why please please tell me why can the Mulberry Creamery not have ginger gelato on their menu every day How dare they lure me in on my first visit with the spicy creamy wonder only to yank it away Even worse there s no way to know when it will make a glorious reappearance I keep going back to the spot where we met last but it s not the same Ginger gelato I miss you Please come back to me Pistachio with black cherry is good but only ginger holds my heart and my tastebuds I promise to visit you every day if you just return 
4IbxGiP2WSSvftXJI1yKIg CMU I ve been to this restaurant twice now and have loved it The owners of the restaurant are really nice and will come and chat with you if you sit down In terms of appetizers I d recommend getting the appetizer sampler because it gives you a small taste of everything on the menu The pita they give with the sampler is warm and you can always ask for more which is a plus In terms of main dish they have a variety of kebabs which is more authentically Turkish than some of the paninis which are delicious If you re a fan of spicier meat I d recommend the Adana kebab but their other kebabs are equally tasty I wouldn t recommend getting dessert it isn t homemade the baklava they served us wasn t very moist 
4IjMN_Nm0XdUC00EJnV-FQ CMU Super fast delivery Only Chinese place that offer wings fries combo Best french fries I ve ever had except at fast food places Update I don t know why I said the stuff above Their food sucks 
4IkkgsZ84G-XelAImrKa-A CMU Quite possibly my favorite place in the entire United States It s unfortunate it has to be in Pittsburgh PA but that s part of what makes it awesome in it s own way I am giving this place the honor of my very first Yelp review even though I have not lived in Pittsburgh for more than a year This place has amazing American pub food The nachos are piled high with an indeterminable amount of good toppings The buffalo wings and other kinds of wings are large properly covered in sauce and perfectly spicy But the best food here are the pizzas The Flying Buffalo the Garden of Eden et al No matter what mood you are in there s an awesome personal pizza to be had As if the food wasn t enough they have probably the best not the largest the best beer selection in Pittsburgh House brews and Great Lakes from Cleveland Guinness Yeungling all on tap More than 50 others in bottles At decent prices too Almost all food is half off after 11PM every night which is key On Saturdays the house blues man Don Sjzeck plays his awesome mix of Johnny Cash Greatful Dead blues and rock covers as well as his fun sing along original stuff It made every Saturday night awesome for me Hangover Breakfast on Sunday mornings is great for its stated purpose Unlimited coffee bloody marys etc Do what you need to do and go there one night It s worth it and its an awesome Pittsburgh experience 
4iy1Rk7JCCNgPKwQgb4Vlw CMU yummy food This is the resturant that my boyfriend and I went to on our first date I have been going here since I was a freshmen in college and it s still very tasty The even had a bagpipe musician in there a couple of saint patricks days ago lol who does that It s a fun resturant for groups too Although I have never had any alcohalic beverages here there drink specials are well advertised On my last visit I had steak fajitas and so tasty and sizzling hot The steak was perfectly season and the veggies had a nice char on them They were serverd in a little cast iron skillet which I thought was cute and exciting I am going to take off one star because our server was on a cordless phone for most of the time we were there I felt that was a tad unperfessonal Good food good prices 
4JeJ6h4EdHPd-Qtd02Layw CMU For 5 a pie how bad can it be Great for the price although I think it s not as good as Domino s or Papa John s I used to order mass amounts from this place for Student Dorm Council meetings at CMU 
4JR17NSMsnOZaT_6rnRmrw CMU It s hard not to give this place and extra star just for sentiment Honestly Ritters is a favorite of mine I love diner food If you re looking for a late night drunken fourth meal this is your place If you just want a no frills greasy spoon Saturday brunch Ritters is there for you This place is blocks from where I live which makes it even better for me and it is open 24 hours One of the only places in town or at least on the East End that holds that title Perfect for those of us that frequent Bloomfield Shadyside and Lawrenceville for late night fun I can t tell you how many times in group of friends looking to satisfy their drunk munchies or otherwise in the wee hours that RITTERS is shouted It s there it s open and ready to serve you anything from it s extensive menu of diner food It s also good anytime to go in and watch the old yinzers on a Saturday morning drink their coffee read the paper and just being so Pittsburgh Served by waitresses in their nurse scrubs that always call you hun The food I have never had a problem with the food I love breakfast and I don t think I have gotten anything else here I think maybe my sunnyside eggs were undercooked once but that has happened to me at really nice restaurants too and eggs just seem to be something that is done wrong fairly often I think their hotcakes are pretty darn good and that is my go to meal A great hangover cure always 
4jSODFTBCG5xJ9kfrFFnlA CMU As with most places in Pittsburgh I got one hell of a Pittsburgh portion when I ordered my fish sandwich And my friend got the equivalent of three turkey club sandwiches in their turkey club So in terms of quantity of food they have things covered I d say my fish sandwich was borderline generic The fish wasnt anything special and the batter was so thick it was soft on the inside and almost underdone The fish was on top of a normal nondescript roll with a piece of withered warm lettuce The fries were very dark in color but surprisingly soft and ok flavored The turkey club was so large it couldn t fit into anyones mouth it had to be disassembled and eaten in parts other than that the meat was good and moist and the bread was fresh There could have been more bacon to balance out the sandwich there must have been at least a half pound of turkey on there and only a couple strips of bacon The side of potato salad was average Not like it came out of a tub but not like it was something terribly special either was a mustard style with some relish big chunks of potato oh and the mozz wedges were good when are they not good service was great glasses never emptied quick and attentive thanks jake 
4jV1PF4JELL_ZhRFveIU9Q CMU When you spend a moment considering if Pennsylvania Turnpike Sbarro s pizza is either the same or just better than the slice you are currently eating you have hit a new low Perhaps it was this location but this was one of the most lousy slices I have ever eaten The pizza wasn t heated up totally even though it had looked like it had been hanging around behind that sneeze glass for awhile The behind the counter service seemed to have no energy to care And again why is the tomato sauce sweetened in pizza in this region I grew up with great pizza in the New York New Jersey area and with family that made great pizza this is nothing like New York style pizza With a dish so simple tomato cheese and dough they have contorted the ingredients to the extent that they all taste processed and the pizza product has no life to it Don t bother stopping if you are serious about pizza 
4K2mFwgTlS31BgTEbALo0A CMU been here twice first time threw up b c i drank their big azz margarita too fast and second time just came for the happy hour margarita the margaritas are pretty strong happy hour is 7 instead of 9 but they don t let you sit at the tables unless you order a meal not even just an appetizer that was annoying had my margarita and left 
4k9eQGpwpzaF2af7gTn7UQ CMU Worst food in Pittsburgh That s all I have been there twice never my choice I had tummy ache both times I think the food is boring Don t get me wrong I have no problem with non gourmet food but Ritter s is just blah It also was an unclean feel at times when you are seated and you look around They are cash only also That doesn t both me at Pamelas because the food is oh so delish Here you are just wasting you apetite on food that has TONS of rooms for improvement 
4kgtigoF0IDJ6RC6OY9e4w CMU Love this place Can get busy at lunch time but the staff always gets me through quickly The veggie burrito with corn salsa is to die for I appreciate that they warn you that extra guacamole will cost more 
4KRaXUg57vN66IGJAIPQaA CMU Best place for cheesesteaks anywhere Their fries are just right too The only thing is that they have a bunch of annoying rules no refills only take cash you don t get fries when you get a sandwich to go but the quality of their sandwiches makes up for all the trouble 
4kWfEOSrRolDeP5ZeJ86hA CMU There are two pages for this restaurant so I m reposting the review I wrote on the other one here This was quite literally the crappiest meal I ve ever had in my life Yes I know what literally means bear with me I ll explain Problem 1 The Service We were asked numerous times by different people if we wanted a soft drink at 2 50 for a small cup of cola No thanks but it took quite a while to get our order taken maybe they were mad we didn t order a pop After that the food took a long time to arrive as well We ordered some naan hoping it would come as an appetizer or at least with the meal but we never got it As we were finishing our meal about an hour later we flagged someone down and asked him to cancel the order He grumbled and wandered off We would have brought this to their attention earlier but at no point during the meal did anyone come to check on us or ask us how the food was The empty table next to us had its tablecloth swapped out twice during this period for reasons I can t even guess but no attention was paid to the customers 3 feet away Getting a water refill was a lot like hailing a cab Problem 2 The Value Everything was priced higher than it would be at comparable nearby Indian restaurants and there was less meat in each dish than you d get from those same competitors The sauces and spices were good but not even close to enough to justify the gap It wasn t that much better than buffet food and given the long wait and high prices that was a major disappointment Problem 3 The Food and the Crap OK I promised to explain what I meant by literally the crappiest meal and here it goes One of the dishes we ordered included shrimp The shrimp were large but had a mysterious and unpleasant earthy taste not attributable to any combination of elements from the pantheon of Indian spices Upon closer inspection the shrimp HAD NOT BEEN DEVEINED For those of you who don t know what this means shrimp have something that looks like a vein running down their backs but it s actually their intestinal track It carries solid excrement out of their bodies Step 1 in any dish is to devein the shrimp to remove the tubule of poop so diners don t chow down on a cylinder of seafaring micro turds The kitchen somehow skipped this step which is SO fundamental not a single contestant on Food Network s Worst Cooks in America failed to complete it adequately when told to prepare shrimp At this point you d think I should have a good conclusion but amidst a panoply of restaurant no nos they LITERALLY fed me shrimp poop I m done To paraphrase Billy Madison I award them one star and may Vishnu have mercy on their souls 
4l3TIxkY7WpzrrJFHJ45Qw CMU Given the other expensive or underwhelming grocery stores in the city I m pretty pleased with this Giant Eagle It s huge has lot of choices You can find just about everything you want They have pretty good ethnic sections Indian Asian Italian etc The meat section is pretty large And while I don t often buy precooked prepared foods there s lots of TV dinner selections Price Yes you re paying a bit more It s nice to be able to get some specialty items alongside the normal stuff and one shouldn t be surprised to pay specialty prices at a big box grocers like Giant Eagle If you want lower prices on something like desi spices tofu or meats go to the specialty stores like Patel Brothers Lotus or Wholey s This is the premium you pay for largely one stop shopping 
4L8BBh39SApaVAKDEl1Fpw CMU My favorite Korean place in Pittsburgh the food is delicious decent service for a Korean place i e Korean restuarant are not known for their services My favorite dish are korean pancakes and tofu and seafood stew 
4lb-I1aSYek0mIXqm51JNw CMU Wow was that some oily bulgogi Although that by itself doesn t warrant 3 stars only offering 3 plates of banchan does What Korean restaurant only offers THREE banchan dishes That s like opening up a McDonald s and only offer one type of burger Anyway it wasn t thoroughly disappointing but it was pricey and we didn t even get the full service banchan that I m used to And I m sorry if I sound like a jackass but coming from LA I m sure this restaurant would go bankrupt if it had to compete against more authentic Korean places My 2c 
4le245j2ifsYbgX2rvujLg CMU Good gyros good desserts reasonable prices 
4lEoUeaE8oQUHwX3Fa1xvg CMU Unimpressive if this is the east coast version of In N Out DEVASTATING Forgot to put onions in my burger even though I specifically asked for them Tasteless fries Low quality beef with chunks of fat in it Super greasy No shakes to wash it down Water costs money Messy tables and chairs with the last guy s grease all over em GOOD It really is five guys working there When one guy went off duty another guy appeared instantly Looks like an authentic burger And the fries look really unique Wish they tasted unique Tastes ok until about halfway through then it s painful Maybe the portions are just too big Take credit cards Free peanuts to chomp on while you wait 
4lOrvmRR-kjRUPC8jIrcBQ CMU I ve been to Belium this is the best I ve had since then The attention to the batter is clear the waffle alone is worth 5 stars Combine it with some strawberries or Dave and Andy s Ice Cream It gets better The prices are very reasonable and the waffles are surprisingly filling be open to sharing one 
4MKLOlYvgSimgq_ECzlPRw CMU Toast is an excellent restaurant Wine bar that opened recently on Baum Blvd This new place has a very creative menu and an excellent and constantly changing wine menu The interior of Toast is part of what makes it so comfortable It has exposed wood beam ceilings that the owner found when he renovated the property The walls are painted dark red and there is a very comfortable lounge area to the right of the bar There is dinner seating in the back and additional dinner seating banquet space upstairs Reservations are definitely a good idea but we haven t had much trouble getting a seat at the bar or lounge area The owner Paul always makes a point to get to know all of his guests He is a former Big Burrito restaurateur and he is extremely knowledgeable about the wine and the food on his menu Every dish and bottle of wine has a story behind it If you tell him what you re in the mood for he is always happy to bring you something to try there is more than just the menu So far we ve been there for drinks wine and appetizers We re going to make a point to go for dinner very soon Food we ve tried so far Lamb Ribs these were incredible Tremendous Just try them Right up there on the addictiveness scale with Red Room s sliders Vegetarian Caesar salad not your typical Caesar salad with nuts and strawberries and bagel chips very fresh and different Black Truffle Beets local beets with black truffles very good for a snack while trying the wine Potato encrusted tuna wraps If you know a lot about wine you ll probably have met your match w Paul We re by no means wine experts so we ve just asked for things as vague as a red wine that has a lot of body to it and gotten back a great Syrah Paul also makes arguably one of the best mohito s in town Yes I would actually say that the mohitos here unseat those of Tonic One of the other nice touches that they do also is a give out fresh bread They ll walk around occasionally with a basket full of different kinds of warm bread And for some reason the butter they give you is an addictive substance of some kind Whatever It s good and I m not ashamed to go through multiple ramekins of it during the night Don t judge Even though there s no parking lot street parking is pretty easy to find on the same side of the street And one last thing worth noting This place has one of the neatest bathrooms I ve ever seen in a restaurant Go to the bathroom to the right of the bar in the back The bathroom is almost shaped like a pie slice and the sink is a concrete sink shaped like the room on the right hand side The sink must be 3 feet wide and maybe 8 wide Very different Overall I gotta say that I m very impressed with Toast as you can tell It s nice to go somewhere in Pittsburgh that s a a wine bar b they make a point to know your name and what you like to eat drink c is fun to hang out in for a long time 
4nDaY19zWI2l7kfFq8DxhA CMU Visited their lunch buffet this past weekend and I was pleased I don t think it is the best Indian buffet in Pittsburgh I prefer Taste of India by Children s Hospital but it was good They had four vegetarian dishes chana masala pakoras soaking in curry sauce palak paneer and an eggplant dish three chicken dishes chicken tikka masala tandoori chicken and chicken curry pakoras papadums a salad bar and gulab jamuns The eggplant dish was my favorite The buffet is 7 99 and we got two 2 off coupons after we paid The only downside is a lot of their dishes contain nuts even the ones you wouldn t expect like vegetable korma and paneer tikka masala If you have allergies just ask them to leave the nuts out I have never found any in my dishes once I started asking the cook to omit them I also have been ordering from here about once a week and I think they are reasonably priced the portions are big their delivery is reliable they re rarely late and they ve occasionally been up to half an hour early and the food is good I m definitely a big fan 
4nfBLAKe_lAONd6CcsTMiw CMU Sometimes I don t know how to feel about the Union Grill it really varies on my experience but overall the food is very good They seem like they CONSTANTLY change the menu but in general is very traditional american food The service here is typically very poor and they almost seem annoyed when you ask for accommodations like large parties Don t even try to seat with less than everyone in your party they won t let you Even if you have something like 9 of 10 I despise going here with more than 1 other person 
4NjVrNpa770qpDuhThSx_A CMU Fast service fresh ingredient wonderful stuff this is the place to go 
4Nq697uAroSSS8DiqC2ujA CMU This is totally subjective but this is my favourite restaurant and I miss it dearly I would only ever get a few things my favourite being Family Style Tofu It s so good Crispy delicious brown savoury sauce mushrooms and carrots and broccoli I usually ate it in two sittings I don t think I can find it where I live now and I only hope I can eventually come up with a recipe to what has become my favourite food So I ve gotten that and I like the Vietnamese Rice Noodle Soup The lemon cakes are also good and a good value I think And yeah the lunch specials are good too with the chicken on a stick If I ever get back to Pittsburgh this is the first place I m going 
4oAIL8z3M7_FGPzWEtyplA CMU The name of this restaurant threw me off when it said Bites Brews thinking there d be a list of side dishes or appetizers But no you can get a side salad for 6 which is the only side dish they have Every item was over priced The service was horrible and with the loud house music in the background I felt like I was at a club not a restaurant Over all bad restaurant I get that it s it s expensive because it s in Shadyside but you should atleast serve quality food for those kind of prices 
4oAiRZj9Sk1eEcuzlD1B9w CMU One of my favorite dinners The food was consistently tasty and always had a great diner feel to it Even on a Sunday afternoon the wait was never too long for a table The wait staff is definitely a bit old but if you can find a good waitress you ll get good service I recommend the spinach feta omelet 
4pdmGe64X2WSPE7q5Yh8gw CMU I came to BTR on my hour break from work to get some take out only one table had been seated so I thought this was going to be a quick trip A very sweet older woman came over with a menu and explained some of the dishes to me I informed her I was a vegetarian and had it narrowed down to 2 choices the Kaung Pond Kyaw or Akitashi tofu She told me many of the dishes can be made vegetarian so I wasn t limited to just the veggie section of the menu Well this opened up countless possibilities for me My eyes narrowed in on the Cambodia dish which is made with coconut cream veggies and tofu instead of chicken for 6 99 Next she asked my spice level preference and I told her a 10 Oh You like it spicy she remarked Yes I like it spicy and I ve ordered too many 8 s that tasted like 2 s so I have a habit of overstating my preferences now My order took longer than I had expected but I knew everything would be fresh so it was no big deal About 20 minutes after ordering the woman came up to me and very apologetically informed me that my order was made with chicken so it had to be redone from scratch I was a little upset only because I had a limited amount of time but I was grateful she came out and explained the situation I had only 10 minutes to enjoy my dinner by the time I got back to work but enjoy it I did Lots of fresh tender veggies and lightly fried tofu were bathed in a spicy A 10 means a 10 here coconut sauce I m sure I ll return but I ll call my order in first 
4PHkHJFpcIrfengxejwTSQ CMU I always walked by this place and wondered if I should try I love middle eastern cuisine One day I went here for lunch with a bunch of coworkers The place was packed and the menu was short which were good signs of a good restaurant I ordered the kibbeh and it was just disgusting I ve had so much better elsewhere It was very dry and tasteless The only real attraction to this place is the student pricing Dishes here are quite cheap Now I see why 
4PIllKHCtP081jrABbw6hA CMU Equally as good as Bangkok Balcony butwith a nicer bar The drinks are always good as is the food 
4Pk6Qi1xyXnwfK658qauHw CMU Great place to go on a Saturday or Sunday morning after drinking way too much The hotcakes are unbelievable but I am a really big fan of their home fries I also really like their corned beef hash I ll usually get some sort of omelette and pair it with a hotcake usually chocolate but blueberry is pretty good too I ll then make sure there is plenty of home fries and get a side of the corned beef hash This usually puts me in a food coma but makes me feel fantastic especially after waking up a little hungover or still drunk from the night before Oh you have to pay with cash And this location is also pretty packed so there is usually a line up outside But it s so worth it 
4prpwqdNNwCUQKhksFRnfQ CMU I love you Mad Mex for your over sized margaritas outstanding bleu cheese dressing and painfully good dip trio appetizer And you know what else Hats off to your Southwestern wing sauce It s REALLY FREAKING GOOD I mean really I m in awe I m quite a wing person and it s rare that I get my socks knocked off anymore Yes you re a little loud and always crowded but now that I ve found the best things on your menu the atmosphere will never stop me again 
4pW_ilX-hVEsMauCuaIfpg CMU If you read through here you ll see a lot of familiar themes for the people who have given this place a poor review namely poor service and mediocre food While the location and style of the restaurant are nice unfortunately that can only go so far to save a dining experience Once seated we waited an interminable amount of time to speak with a server It was so long in fact that we had to literally shout a passing waiter down We ordered wine and attempted to order an appetizer only to find out that they were out of our first three choices at 7 30 When we weren t prepared to order our main course we were scolded and told that we would have to wait longer for our meals now And wait we did While we sipped our bottle of wine which was the wrong bottle and opened before it was presented to us we waited for our tartar After a near 30 minute wait for raw beef it took another 40 minutes for us to receive our entrees even though we had ordered them only moments after the tartar While we waited we watched tables around us ask about their meals only to be told that there was only one chef tonite and that people need a night off The chicken and lamb were cooked well but very bland and the sauce was ineffective in enhancing the dishes After over two hours and a hefty bill the over whelming urge to leave was just too strong to recommend this place to anyone else Obviously some people love it but enough people have had the same type of experience to raise genuine red flags 
4q1AU6C31-rZBZIglbyUjg CMU The old Walnut Grill has been recreated into a modern atmosphere Gone are the warm wood tones and in are the grey and steel It s not a bad thing a fresh look is needed when you take over a well known place We happened to come upon this place on a Wednesday night Why mention the day of the week you ask Because it was half off bottle of wine night Score So of course we picked the cheapest Malbec and had a nice little time with our 15 bottle o wine The menu looked pretty good with some tempting dishes so I went with the Cioppino It came out with massive pieces of shrimp clams mussels and halibut nestled in the middle The thing that really made the dish was the spicy tomato broth It tasted awesome with the whole dish and throw in the garlic crostini to soak up the sauce was awesome At 23 it was well worth it for the amount of seafood you get I d for sure stop in again probably on a Wednesday because this girl likes a deal and some wine 
4q3Jg4xE5cUYQC2DgdQ4Rw CMU We ordered take out from this place and the only plus was that it came pretty quickly Other qualities of the food included being too salty and too much sauce Pretty cheap too we ordered online and we were able to order something free for every 10 you order but this is not good enough for me to go back to this place again 
4qkTRXAX1lvFUiE8Hu3M8w CMU If you re looking for greasy Chinese delivery look no further Two pad thais and two egg rolls came to less than 20 The pad thais were huge and left more than enough for next day lunch leftovers The egg rolls were pretty greasy but hit the spot Not the greatest food I ve ever eaten but sometimes a girl just needs some really greasy noodles Delivery available through Meals Delivered and Campus Food Campus Food is cheaper 
4qKzsQpfn4pPXjreFNrvyQ CMU hmm first review on yelp unfortunately it s not the best so I LOVE PDC I used to come here a lot over the past few years because I love the food and the atmosphere it s very casual and just what you d want from a deli bar in the burgh But they recently changed ownership They renovated the interior so it s a lot shinier but no more of that real casual homey feel that gave it its charm But the worst is that they CHANGED THE MENU Their old items were so good I don t know why they would But no more hummus philly cheese steaks curly fries chicken wraps the list goes on Now it s really more of a sandwich place You can make your own cold cut sandwich or order a cold cut or panini Everything s 8 bucks so it s a good deal but I wasn t too impressed I ordered a jerk chicken panini but i thought it was just ehh kind of dry And the fries that came with it weren t that good All those pictures posted of the food here are from the previous ownership the deli itself isn t that bad it s just not really good anymore went from 5 stars to 3 stars hopefully they ll change it back a bit If so someone let me know cause i won t be back here again 
4QtDUv10Zw2Hf6frxHDDQw CMU No no no this is NOT the way Korean food should be done I ve come here a few times as a CMU student to try to get a taste of home but it has always disappointed me The food here is not authentic at all and it tastes pretty bad 
4S-AhmrVwZ9DwXi6Pb6z8Q CMU Chopstix has a full menu of chinese and japanese goodies including sushi They also have really low prices Alas maybe it was too good to be true While my sweet and sour chicken was standard the sushi I ordered was quite awful It was not fresh by a long shot It was a good deal but the sushi was a major let down 
4TGKr8eGuQ88qBmn2y9Puw CMU The best Thai place in Pittsburgh This place is pretty crowded and the service is acceptable But they have great Panang Tofu Green curry and all other yummy veggie rolls Their peanut sauce is great and i am actually running out of words because my mouth is watering I would love to go to this place again when i visit Pittsburgh And for some reason the name Bangkok Balcony seems very classy and attractive My friend suggested this place and i owe him one for this Smriti 
4uJStRaw0Oj6ckkH-xQbwA CMU I was traveling to Pittsburgh on a business trip and had no idea where to eat thanks to Yelp I found Chaya s and decided to check it out The place is a bit small but has a quaint atmosphere and I loved that all the servers are dressed in Japanese couture I m never a fan of sitting alone but the server came over and was immediately friendly He noticed that I was wearing a race shirt and we started discussing our running history his was far more impressive than mine I wasn t starving so I opted to grab an appetizer and a roll I went with the veggie tempura and an eel cucumber and avocado roll I found the tempura to be just right but I wasn t in love with the tempura sauce then again I m not exactly an expert The sushi was fantastic and I was upset I didn t opt for more After completing those I considered getting some nigiri the waiter was happy to make recommendations I tried the Toro extremely fatty but delicious The service was fantastic and the sushi was reasonably priced If I were traveling back to Pitt I d definitely consider stopping in Chaya s again and trying a wider variety of sushi 
4V01cZC9bWPRNDgP85nzFg CMU This place is right by my church and I ve always walked by it but never stopped to eat here Ate here for lunch today and I enjoyed it They have outdoor seating so it s real nice when the weather s nice The staff is super friendly The owner I think that s who he was walks around and makes sure everything is all good and the other staff members are nice as well The food is pretty good I got the potato gnocchi YUM I also enjoy when entrees come with a soup or salad which this place did Only thing is we didn t have utensils for the longest time and our server didn t notice even when she brought us our salads Brought our salads and then left We had to flag somebody else down to get them I would come here again 
4vH5fr6K5f5nYVlAq7rX5Q CMU This Kiva Han on Craig Street is a great little coffee shop That said I don t drink coffee but the hot chocolate is good and the smoothies are fresh made and top notch I recommend the peach though Marissa prefers the strawberry banana They also have food which varies a bit but can provide a light lunch The atmosphere is great especially in summer and its a reasonable place to work very close to Carnegie Mellon 
4vU8NDblwKi3a9g60Y0Eog CMU I was visiting Pittsburgh on business for the week and the manager at my hotel suggested Toast as it was within walking distance from the hotel It turned out to be a great choice I really loved the dimly lit ambiance inside it gave it a speakeasy feel I sat at the bar which had hooks underneath for my purse love when a bar does that The wine list was great but there was no Malbec which is what I usually go for so I decided on a Cote du Rhones per the suggestion of the bartender It was delicious I was stuck between the crispy pork and the scallops but the bartender was kind and knowledgeable he directed me toward to scallops I am so glad he did They were matched with a sweet potato puree corn salsa greens and a maple gastrique I was the happiest girl in town 
4vXxrdHWzlcLBDSzqjBKHA CMU Tasty Crepes In Pittsburgh PA Although you may wait in line you need to PLAN your attack to go here worth the wait Dessert and Savory Crepe Options Abound a Excellent Choices Had been looking forward to going here a while and could not decide between Ham and Salmon I ended up ordering a Ham and house cheese crepe and a salad with a Champagne vinagrette b Good Service Got take out but the staff was quite friendly c Good Location On Walnut Street in Shady Side District of Pittsburgh Looking forward to going back 
4wjcBS3fiuuMh_VKUx_cqQ CMU Very nice Had the gyro Very good gyro The sauce used for the gyro is what makes it so delish The other toppings were nothing special Will be back for more Cashew fingers were only a meh for me 
4WlZNAsWt7-uHksP8SIZMA CMU Stopped over Murray Ave to see what was shaking at the banjo shop and stopped in Napoli for a couple slices It was right after lunch and not too busy there was only a couple tables of Cops loitering er I mean lunching and that s it The Pizzeria is set up like your typical slice shop with the added bonus that you can buy Beer 1 also I tried a Pepperoni roll and a slice of pepperoni with a Coke The roll came with a side of sauce and was quite tasty well where there was pepperoni it was tasty I had a couple bites that was only dough 1 The slice was also good a nice thin slice with thinly sliced pepperoni that curls when cooked As I was sitting down the Owner pulled a sausage pie from the oven mmmm ground hot sausage 1 HELLO So I had one of those too And it was yummy too I had a great conversation with the owner and another customer that came in after me All in all even tho I am a big fan of Mineo s I would and will definitely give these guys more business 
4xaYTtMC7io8CMlxbpM6EQ CMU Healthy diverse cheap friendly fulfilling nice staff generous no adjectives can be enough to describe this joint better than anything on CMU s campus 
4xBIMfoeR5II3T3Nlhlr1A CMU I was headed to a computer lab around lunchtime today when I noticed the building lit up at the edge of Schenley Park in Oakland was it open Having seen the construction progress along throughout the spring and summer months I was anxious to sit down and give this brand spanking new restaurant a try First surprise it is NOT a full service restaurant When I walked in I was promptly greeted and two hostesses handed me a menu They directed me to go to the register when I was ready to order The menu looked fresh seasonal and original and consisted of salads sanwiches soup and wood fired pizzas All of the sandwiches come with either greens or crispy taters with curry ketchup more on that later I finally settled on a sandwich The Roasted Pig pork roast carmelized onions ricotta and red pepper aioli and I wanted to try both of the sides so I asked for the greens and paid for a side of the crispy taters In all my meal was around 13 If I had gotten anything to drink other than water I imagine it would have topped 15 They gave me a number with my order as they bring the food to your table Second surprise The water bar I just wanted water with lunch and the girl who took my order pointed me towards a spot on the bar with two larges containers of water one with cucumbers and one with lemon You can help yourself to all you like of either The flavored water was a nice touch The Porch is seat yourself and I found a table with a great view of the park and a bench seat it was roomy and comfortable I waited about 10 minutes for my food to arrive and the greens looked fresh and bright the bread was crisp and chewy at the same time and the potatoes looked divine First thing to try the greens They were tasty and clearly very fresh if a little bit on the salty side I m not sure WHAT they are tossed in but it was light and tasty I hate when I go to a restaurant and they give me OLD greens lettuce in my salad it is such a huge turnoff Next A bite of those potatoes The crispy taters weren t exactly what I expected them to be the work tater put tater tots into my brain but these were fresh small potatoes diced kind of like homefries and seasoned And on the side was the curry ketchup Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE curry the curry ketchup is GENIUS The curry gives a little kick of spice and a something extra to the ketchup and the seasoned potatoes while good by themselves were really something special with a dab of the curry ketchup on them Note If you re not a fan of curry you CAN request regular ketchup And then my sandwich I can t claim it was a flavor explosion in my mouth but the bread was toasted just the right amound and the onions were sweet and tasty The pork was flavorful and the texture was spot on It wasn t really messy althought the last couple bites kind of fell apart a bit and the cheese didn t stay on the sandwich well Speaking of which I couldn t really taste the cheese although the type of cheese on the sandwich was a mild one so the one thing I would change if I were making the sandwiches would be to use a sharper stickier cheese that would also help hold the sandwich together Someone came by and refilled my water glass several times throughout my meal and another person took my plate away when I was done eating The staff was friendly and attentive and no one acted like they were just there to do a job While I didn t have any alcoholic beverages there was a beer and wine list and The Porch also makes fresh seasonal soda to order Overall a nice place and definetly somewhere I would take a friend for a casual lunch 
4xcifIQ3hcfjPB2PuNHv5w CMU What a fantastic find Tiny Italian restaurant family owned nestled on a side street in very yuppified shadyside walnut street area Look out for small yelpy dogs on the sidewalk Food is fantastic Noodles home made sauces are beautiful and the atmosphere is authentic I feel like i am having dinner in my aunt Gilda s dining room BYO except they offer complimentary Chianti and pinot grigio I had 3 glasses Love it Enjoy 
4XPrPTrOt7Hb0JyBhHal0Q CMU This is by far my favorite hoagie place in the entire city I love it I can t give a lot of insight on their pizza although I know you can buy it by the slice because I always get a cheesesteak They are the best in the city Make sure you ask for mayo They don t use regular mayo it is a garlicky tasty mmm mmm good finger licken sauce I always get extra Yummy The steak meat is excellent It looks and tastes like it is hand carved Really good quality no steak umm s here The price can t be beat I have their phone number committed to memory I always call to place my order then zoom on in 10 minutes later to pick it up The people that work there are great and you can even see where they make the hoagies right in front of you Definitely worth it By far the best hoagie shop in town Give it a shot you won t be disappointed 
4xpypqlFIpcHxrcLz1h_0w CMU Random It took me a minute to find this place it s actually right across the street from the PNC bank You would never guess that this was a bar it made it even more difficult b c it was dark and raining I was able to find street parking right out front and when I got in the crowd was fairly young but that s what I expected around the universities It wasn t very crowded as I went during the week The bartender was friendly and drinks were extremely affordable I m not sure that I would go out of my way for PHI but if I was in the area and looking for a cheap drink then why not now that I know where it is 
4yAhKNo4b6vHAgNxyH745g CMU I ve gone here for lunch two times and each time I ve gotten a sandwich and fries mixed russet and sweet potatoes Both times I was happy with what I ordered It s all quality stuff but speaking as a poor grad student the value for your money isn t as good as it would be at some of the other restaurants in the area 
4yF5U5vSXOyV66Bp1S6WHA CMU places like Oishii Bento make me wish I lived on or near a college campus If oishii Bento wore 66 it would score a natural hat trick Its good cheap and for the area its unique I must say thinking about OB brings out the poet in me Two roads diverged from a steel city Shogun OB oh hell with Hibachi The flying shrimp out of our way Parking nearby we shall pray Bento boxes peaks my interest and that has made all the difference 
4yJ1Fj7gY6W44PVwo1D3Vg CMU I was really excited to try this place Shadyside needs a healthy delicious lunch spot so I was hoping this would be it It s not First of all Eden is a re do of the previous restaurant The Juice Box Cafe Which in my opinion missed the boat I was hesitant to order once I figured that out because the service at The Juice Box was SO SLOW Anyhow I have it a try and an HOUR later my lunch was brought to me which at this point was in take out form because I couldn t wait a minute longer My grilled cheese panini wasn t even put on the panini press for more than 10 seconds it was like eating bread straight out of the bag I don t really get how they could screw up a second restaurant Hire more people get people in and out during the lunch hours I mean come on they are making smoothies and turkey sandwiches The food is OK but not worth waiting an hour for Bummer Side note I heard several other people complaining about the exact same thing Two people walked out while I was there 
4Z6PFR5cbL04e2GMFYiQ4A CMU Muhammad is one hell of guy Best Baba Ghanooj I ve had Told him how awesome his food is and he made me some sort of veggie pita for free which was amazing Can t wait to make it back to Oakland to visit this place 
4ZoL--o_3i-8WTuJ3UROyQ CMU When I heard that the Primanti Brothers was known for sandwiches stacked high with cole slaw and fries I thought it sounded disgusting Don t get me wrong I love fries But fries in a sandwich really That s ridiculous Also I don t like cole slaw Of course since I was only here for a weekend I HAD to try it I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and of course I left it as is stacked with cole slaw and fries The sandwich was massive I couldn t actually take a bite into the entire thing I had to take it apart and take it in piece by piece When I finally got a mouth full of everything I was surprised It was really good I was surprised how tender and flavorful the chicken tasted and the fries were great It s really just like having potatoes in your sandwich Also the cole slaw was not bad either The thick bread was real buttery and tasty too Obviously not a healthy option but I would say Primanti Brothers is definitely something one should try in Pittsburgh 
4_7D6oSA0-t2gMgX2CfTog CMU This is my go to for Mexican American food in Oakland It s a chain restaurant so you can expect a similar experience to any other Chipotles that you have visited The main reason I would recommend Chipotle over the other Mexican restaurants in the area is that this seems to be most students favorite spot as well This means that new customers are continuously being served throughout the day which means all the meats were prepared recently Food is constantly on rotation so you don t have to worry about ingredients being left out for too long 
5-PbpTipfcJeMvVXfkENvg CMU The best place for breakfast in Shadyside especially if you don t feel like being drowned in food at Pamela s There might be a wait and don t try to go with more than two others really make it a date but it s so clean and nice and relaxing The crepes are excellent I always get the breakfast crepe sausage and egg with their soytang sauce but the dessert crepes chocolate and orange banana are also delicious The little salad of greens and orange slices that comes with the savory crepes is a great addition Go here when you re feeling cosmopolitan 
5-q6_4h8KivR0W1mde7ZQA CMU Within the past year Quaker Steak and Lube opened up a new location in Oakland Back in college I would have to drive 20 mins out towards the airport to get my Quaker Steak fix Back in the day Quaker Steak claims to be the Best Wings USA and I do like them a whole lot I haven t had the real Buffalo wings in Buffalo but I am making it a life goal to take a trip and try them for myself Until that time comes Quaker Steak will be my wings place They have other things on the menu too but I wouldn t know anything about them The Oakland location is convenient but it s not my favorite place What I do like about it is that you can look right into the kitchen from the take out window As I waited for my order I watched them fry my wings pour on the sauce shake it around in a big plastic bucket and create a masterpiece in my styrofoam take out container yum 
5-UwaR1HX-CvaunhOOe5Nw CMU We lived right around the corner from this place SO DANGEROUS With a half off late night menu 11pm 1am which includes pretty much everything minus the tacos and a couple other more obscure items when our late night munchies came grumbling this place usually took precedence We are big fans of the Pick A Dippa We usually get the pico usually very fresh and juicy guac consistently delicious and chunky and the pineapple habanero which seems to vary depending on the season produce Sometimes it s straight spicy sometimes it s a perfect balance of sweet pineapple and a spice that builds on the tongue The color is usually a good indication of the heat darker spicier yellower sweeter We always make sure to order a side of sour cream which they usually don t charge for to pair with the pineapple habanero cuts the heat enough so I can enjoy it My boyfriend LOVES the wings Mild San Francisco with blue cheese He s also a huge fish taco fan and these were some of his favorite in Pittsburgh I love the house salad with the lime cilantro vinaigrette one of the best dressings in Pittsburgh and the tofu isn t bad either tofu tacos yum Also developed a liking for their quesadillas I d usually order one with just cheese grilled onions and peppers and corn Depending on the cook that day it could be a let down or it could be amazing Can t beat the waffle fries which are perfectly crispy or heaven forbid I forget to mention the Big Azz Margaritas I don t like the fact that you can taste the basic pre mixed margarita underneath all of the fruit flavors but you can t beat the alcohol content or the size Be prepared for a very fuzzy buzzy brain freeze Oakland is okay for college standards food and service varies greatly depending on when you go but go to the Shady Side location if you want the best Mad Mex has to offer 
50MHXBgL4QEgWwOZUpRfrg CMU I want to try this place again However I will just say it i HATE SMALL PLATES It makes it so expensive to try anything I just want to eat And all the good stuff seems to be put on small plates with tiny portions I know i know quality not quantity WHATEVER I am hungry However the flavors are right no the menu is authentic and the food seems great I have to go back because I ordered above my spice level last time and didn t get to eat much of my dinner I just cried SO I have learned my lesson and will try again Try the golangal soup It is straight outer Thailand Haven t tasted anything like it in USA IT WAS AMAZING AMAZING A great Thai option slightly more expensive though 
50tB2qj2YMFbuIck5lIsDA CMU The corned beef and sauerkraut they use in the reuben is of very poor quality and the dressing was very watery The macaroni cheddar salad wasn t great either but at least it wasn t overly expensive and delivery was prompt 
526wua1UZN5zYlP6IsYyVQ CMU This has been one of my favorite restaurants since 2010 While the gryo s and falafel sandwiches are incredible the main attraction for me is the humus which is homemade I recently purchased a gyro and noticed that it was very different than before the pita didn t fall apart after my 15 minute walk home and it was not dripping everywhere I went back the next day and the owner told me that he recently decided to dry the meat a little and reduce the cucumber sauce The new sandwich is great Its enough sauce that each bite is mixed with a blend of the hot pepper sauce and the cool yogurt It i also awesome to not need a fork or kill a tree in napkins per sandwich 
52K_EyAeJfPyJKY1Y_d1jw CMU I ve had 3 things here That s because often once I really love something I will order it to death I love the combination satay The menu claims it is grilled on a lava rock I d like to see that Well whatever it s delicious At lunch it s one skewer chicken 1 pork 1 beef At dinner you also get 1 shrimp and you get to pay a little more I also had the pad thai That s what most of my co workers get I say Eh I ve had better I also tried my husband s Burmese BBQ chicken Delicious with a curry and garlic flavor but not an overpowering flavor plus very tender Finally I love their little samosas While they are fried they don t seem heavy Light and delightful with an accompanying sweet sauce Oh they also have a HUGE tea menu although I ve never ordered myself a pot But if you re into that sort of thing they ve got a big menu PS I don t know who said they take reservations We just asked tonight and it was ixnay on the eservations ray 
52Za3uBM6s1cyb9Nxj3mfA CMU Red Oak is a great spot if you are looking for a change in the food that is typically served in Oakland Red Oak avoids the greasy persona of the surrounding venues and offers a tasteful spin on more nutritious entrees The restaurant offers daily specials which I am quite a fan of Red Oak is very Vegan and Vegetarian friendly Red Oak also offers a wide selection of sandwiches and wraps however given the scarcity of food that is tasteful healthful and served in a creative fashion I reccomend ordering the specials here 
53P4gF1Y8nDdpIXzghnsMw CMU Probably the best place for all American food I stuck with fish which was really good Never can go wrong with this place Next to CMU and just a couple of blocks from Pitt Grilled salmon was done perfect and also had the rib eye steak with was good as well Good mashed potatoes and green beans too Take your friends out and never get disappointed Plenty of specials during the week to take advantage of 
53QdaKm-7ZOAgX4BsqqRfA CMU Mmmm Crepe pancakes What an idea 4 25 stars sure I can give quarter stars why not Per the bf s suggestion we went to Pamela s for brunch on our first stop of our day trip in Pittsburgh Hmmm a brunch place you say Why not Cool decor inside half hipster half well midwest diner Our wait wasn t really that long we put in our name at around 11 30am on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend and was seated within 30 minutes In the meantime while we waited we checked out the cool Mexican place above Pamela s Cool He got the standard breakfast special which was standard there s no way to really rate that stuff and choc chip banana hotcakes I ordered the blueberry hotcakes His choc chip banana hotcakes were so so good Bananas stuffed into a thin crepe of a pancake with the chocolate all melting inside omg it was good My blueberry crepe pancakes seemed to be extra crispy which I liked by the way with brown sugar and sour cream in it I felt like there needed to be more stuffing in it but it was still pretty good Coffee was standard here as well But I LOVEEEeeee diners so this was a place that was above your normal diner Cool I still crave those crepe hotcakes 
54EoIA8uk0KoRi9XJNsahA CMU I am from Pittsburgh but now live in Detroit and I think about Girasole often as a special place to go when you want some great Italian comfort food and a loud bustling atmosphere The staff is friendly and you ll often see Mr Girasole walking back and forth checking how you like your meal and pouring more wine This small and very quaint Italian restaurant is located in the heart of Shadyside You have to walk down about 6 or 7 steps to get to the door so if you are handicapped or elderly it may be a tad tough It is a little pricey but for good Italian like your Mamma makes it s worth it I had the pumpkin ravioli and the house salad I loved the salad dressing it s light and delicious and the pumpkin ravioli was excellent as well I really chowed on the thick slices of Italian bread and they willingly brought lots more upon request We had a party of 9 and were happy to have made a reservation in advance Go early on a weekend evening as the wait looked treacherous by the time we left the restaurant at 7 00PM Girasole reminds me of eating in my Italian Grandma s basement kitchen The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because the servers were a bit slow in providing basics like water and silverware in the beginning of the meal Otherwise Manga Manga 
54IMYA3ZecwkyHFZBrcvyQ CMU Cute date night spot the pumpkin soup was AMAZING I m a pumpkin lover so this definitely raised the bar for the Silk Elephant from me Vegetarian friendly You ll see me back here soon must have another bowl of that soup 
55rUDXXRLfYzmOlFJZi6JA CMU We were very eager to try out this place since we love La Feria and Peruvian food in general We checked the menu and ordered 3 appetizers the entrees were pricey and we wanted to try more items The ceviche was good and my partner wiped the plate clean we both thought the fish was more cooked that it usually is in ceviches in Peru and other places here The corn fitters were next the sauces were good but the fritters were fried dark brown and were immensely salty The waitress did say the chef would work on it in the future We had a chicken on a stick appetizer which was not yet on the menu This was also had a liberal dosage of salt but was not bad The sauces are the same for 2 of these three We had the tamarind mojito which was good For dessert we tried the suspiro port wine whipped cream over peruvian dulce de leche This one was great but really really sweet I would try the arroz con leche the next time The service is great but I m not sure how soon I ll be back 
56DM9VEePX-NjFaRGFhbkw CMU Bros 
56y9CNqtOSadvwKeDeFcOQ CMU This place wasn t great but it was cheap and there s a student discount if you have your ID 
57Uxtn0FA2ZVkHXr1KCiXQ CMU This place seems like somewhat of an anachronism in an era where nearly every single eatery out there accepts credit cards and stays open past 8pm but it s okay because their subs are amazing Sure you only get fries with your sub if you dine in and you ll have to go to the PNC next door to get cash to pay for your food but once you get that sub with a pile of fries next to it you won t care The subs are large and can be split among two people if you aren t too hungry but they do say they charge for refills on your soda at certain places Someone mentioned that the fries are like crack and this is most definitely true They re the thin greasy kind that doesn t get all hard and nasty when they cool down and you never really have enough of them I end up getting the ultra Philly cheesesteak every time I come around here Their filet mignon sub is just alright in comparison because it doesn t really matter if filet mignon is a more tender cut of steak if it ends up getting thinly sliced up the same Uncle Sam s special bread definitely grows on you and is the perfect sub bread Regardless of its superficial shortcomings Uncle Sam s is one of the very few reasons why I would even want to go back to Pittsburgh 
589CTHQMC3gB-aevgFb3Rg CMU Flies in this place 
58x0GLPffLa3ou2dftQdwA CMU I ve had General Tso Mehh I ve experienced so much better 
59HCeWQPf_pDyP0n-34g-Q CMU So far this is the closest that I have been able to come to a meal in Pittsburgh that even resembles a meal in San Francisco Open Table for my reservation check Found plenty of free street parking on a Sunday eve check Plenty of seating available for a 6pm reservation check Didn t know they had a patio Beautiful upstairs setting for a warm summer evening It appears they also have a gas heater on the patio for chilling nights of dining as well I started with a chopped salad very San Francisco mango cucumber papaya mint avocado cashews and a miso dressing The waitress brought over complements of the kitchen a yellow orange saucy cucumber sampling with pita squares Not bad for just a taste I ordered the Alaskan Halibut which was amazing Not the absolute best I ve ever had but it was pretty high up there on the list especially in a city where fried foods are the norm And there was plenty on my plate to fill me up no room for dessert I would definitely return especially if entertaining out of towners 
5AHyZJTGgTjm5UsBcBm3Sw CMU Making the reservation easy and friendly Atmosphere quaint and inviting if you do not like tight spaces this isn t for you Menu great I love the small seasonal menu and focus on more day to day options Very well conceived Appetizer delicious The heirloom tomato salad was perfect and the Yellowfin Tuna trio of sushi was even better Entrees mediocre at best The Kung Pao Tofu was lacking in the spicy peanutty character of good Kung Pao My Short Rib Tacos weren t seasoned and the Chipotle Cream was just pink cream Dessert amazing The chocolate was amazing The kicker and reason for my poor rating was when my server dropped a wine glass on my entree plate before I was finished and it shattered It made a HUGE mess and really upset the table next to us I work in restaurants and make mistakes myself but they failed to recover from their mistake The server was extremely apologetic but I had to pay full price for an entree that I was unable to finish and the chef sent out an extra of my date s meal to go They also did not charge me for our 2 bottles of wine its BYOB Had they supplied me with another entree or not charged me for the one they destroyed I would be more gracious I don t intend on coming back 
5alH1Uu2XVkjMCI1iTp6jw CMU Me and my fiance went here late one night and split a famous Primanti Bros cheesesteak sandwich Just like they say it s packed with way too much coleslaw little or no mayo but still good french fries and soft italian bread Definitely over the top But good nonetheless 
5Atq7ZxZOzv03KvfxdaAzA CMU Yum and BYOB Stopped by on a whim while searching for a quick lunch venue Never heard of it but glad I found it Great dill yogurt dip forget what it s called and delicious eggplant salad Plenty of pita brought by a pleasant cute waiter with a great voice My friend and I split a salad and three appetizer sampler and got out for about 13 bucks Next time we are bringing a bottle of wine and heartier appetites 
5bTc4KSI2rDpaos32Zxzfg CMU Silk Elephant is our go to restaurant when we have visitors or when we re feeling a little fancy but don t want to venture outside of Sq Hill I love their signature cocktails like the Asian Pear Martini the Ginger Cooler The duck dishes are to die for as are the Thai Crab Crowns and Dumplings My husbands loves getting the whole flash fried fish I wish the cocktails and tapas were a little less expensive but their cost is on par with similar restaurants Reservations will generally make your life easier but are not required 
5C7hDes0UXYpxrhZBPbBFg CMU Iv e been to better places I always forget that they dont take a card so I have to remember to get cash out when I go there I usually order their omelets The veggies are always crunchy so I taste more of a raw onion than I do my omelet The food comes out fast which is great until I tasted the food I checked it out three or four times to see if it might be different but the omelets were the same Raw and crunchy overall nice atmosphere nice service but the food is blah 
5Cw01yOgk6-JdycYa3V2kw CMU I had a Valentine s dinner here and it was pretty much the atmosphere that made the meal for me The food definitely wasn t bad but for the price it definitely wasn t the most amazing Italian food I d ever had Like I said very nice atmosphere very cozy and classic feeling 
5dFYOrOUS7sRV_VT_JSU9A CMU What a great Pittsburgh dining experience I am a born and raised Pittsburgh girl who has been living in New York City since 2006 and I can honestly say the food here most definitely compares to any great dining experience in Manhattan It is so wonderful to see some eclectic creative menus popping up in Pittsburgh and I truly enjoyed this aspect of Up Modern Kitchen great menu and well priced for its offerings It took me nearly twenty minutes to decide what I wanted to eat because I was so overjoyed by such appealing and mouth watering options Before being seated I sat at the very relaxed and modern looking bar and started with a pear vodka type cocktail that was DELICIOUS and maybe my new favorite drink The bartender was friendly informative about the drink menu but not overbearing the perfect type of service After being seated and finally making up my mind for food choices I decided on the heirloom tomato salad as an appetizer So delicious summery and refreshing that I probably could have eaten two It was served with some very fresh buffalo mozzarella and a balsamic reduction an updated and tastier twist on the blah and boring basil tomato mozzarella dish I loved it For my entree I had the sauteed chicken with gnocchi and caponata Usually chicken can be dull but I loved everything about the way this dish was prepared Not to mention the chicken itself was cooked PERFECTLY very juicy and tender The gnocchi was freshly made in house and the caponata was the perfect compliment to everything the white balsamic in it added a touch of sweetness that I really liked with the chicken The non cellar wines were all half price which was a great addition to the evening Overall fantastic experience great service and a fantastic addition to the growing Pittsburgh foodie scene P S I noticed there is an intensely negative review on here from someone who didn t even TRY THE FOOD Perhaps next they can write lengthy detailed reviews for films they have only seen the previews for 
5diYfEXTAfnnvzclHugNxw CMU Are you in Pittsburgh Do have a craving for chips and salsa but are unable to satisfy it because you re Pittsburgh Just go to Mad Mex It s my absolutely favorite uber americanized californized tex mex bar restaurant voodoo lounge in the whole world They re unabashedly american tex mex here but they also respect their Pittsburgh roots You can get a buffalo chicken burrito here Try finding THAT in San Francisco You can even get your burrito with cross cut fries oh Pittsburgh i miss you sometimes That said they actually do have awesome humungous fork and knife burritos such as Super Mad Mex with Steak So good When they say spicy they mean spicy The restaurant has the coolest logo ever I bought 2 pint glasses to take home with me The service is great if not eccentric They have half off food after 11pm in the Oakland tradition However its typically way too crowded at that time to eat successfully The lesser known secret is they do half off lunch from 2 4pm Mon Thursday This is a much better way to go FYI The chips salsa are free at the bar but not at the table Also they will try to sell you guacamole and sour cream with every dish but it s not free Mad Mex also has a decent selection of beer on tap including at various times Rogue Dead Guy Delirium Tremens et al And of course they have IC Lite and Yeungling for the pittsburgher in you So go get a huge azz margarita some beer some great food and stumble down atwood street drunk with the rest of the crowd 
5DMgHxvmfq954p0XoVA_bQ CMU Little Nipper s is a pretty good college town kind of pizza place designed to be quick for delivery and take out The pizza is good but unremarkable the prices are low and the non pizza offerings include most everything you d want and expect from a place like this Overall my experiences here have been fairly unremarkable either positively or negatively so 3 stars seems appropriate 
5DpX1Ig4QacYtzIin1uE2g CMU Best eggs in the burgh Actually probably the best eggs I have had anywhere They cook them well and I dont know how but they are more flavorful than anywhere else The prices are reasonable it is large so seating is usually not a problem and it is open 24 7 What is not to like about a diner that is open all the time The menu has a wide selection of non breakfast fare and everything I have tried so far is maybe not the best in the city but is surprisingly solid 
5EiDrFqfEq8Mv8fIJXJP7g CMU I haven t been home to Pittsburgh for a while and I was really excited to get out and explore the food scene Although Harris Grill wouldn t have been my first pick I try to stay away from the preppy Shadyside scene I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere food and service I really enjoyed indoor atmosphere that mixed trendy decor with dim sexy lighting Our server was excellent and kept the drinks coming and I was extremely impressed by their craft beer selection And I would certainly come back to enjoy their expansive outdoor patio I got to sample a lot of different selections We started with the Dippo de Queso con Carne which was a spicy mix of chilies cheese and chorizo Served with pita bread it was good but there are better things on the menu And onto those the Baby Burgers were delectable as were the Britney Spears I swear that s the real name The Britney Spears were marinated and skewered chicken that was served with some zesty chipolte sauce and rich pesto After all of this I probably would have given 3 stars HOWEVER the Mac Cheese was excellent and as a connoisseur of mac n cheese I know my stuff What topped off this meal was the incredible Eggplant Lasagna Lasagne Aubergine that I shared with a friend Now I m not one to ever order anything that doesn t have meat in it But I would truly go back to Harris Grill JUST FOR THE EGGPLANT LASAGNA The eggplant was breaded and fried and layered with pesto marinara and layers of delicious cheese I would highly recommend this dish to anyone whether you re a vegetarian or not And I will certainly be going back just to check out their bacon night 
5enCTbNLyZLUWs-Elq5iUw CMU It s true Their burgers are damn good And I fell bait to the Artisinal Cheeseburger the first time best decision ever Second time I had the Local which was still good but not as good as the Artisinal Their burgers are definitely big hearty ones with just the right amount of dressings It s really all in the meat that makes it so good at Union Grill cooked to perfection juicy and super satisfying The atmosphere is kinda dimlit but really cozy feeling It s got a charm of an English pub sort of I suppose it s one of the classier places on Craig Street a place where college students would get their takeout fix at neighboring restaurants like Maximum Flavor Little Asia Orient Express and Lulu s Noodles As a CMU student myself whose lab was on Craig Street I can certainly attest that going to Union Grill for a beer and a meal was a treat I never made it out to their wine night specials but it seems worth checking out 
5Eu23X-pLQXMkSVIaC7iJw CMU This is perhaps the best BBQ I ve ever had I will be going back soon and regularly Wow The couple in front of me were caterers and claimed this was the best BBQ they d ever had Their other claim was that these black eyed peas are good enough to start a fight and yeah they re damn awesome Everything is smoked here nothing is fried The meat is tender flavorful and plentiful I tried the brisket ribs chicken and all four sides and thought that everything absolutely everything was top notch while being cheaper than takeout from any other restaurant They had three sauces let people sample them and could expllain each the style of bbq the sauces were from The sauces had a bit of kick none were at all hot sauce I d call them medium A red tomato based sauce a yellow mustard based sauce awesome on the chicken and a thin vinegar based sauce perfect on the pulled pork The sides were collard greens black eyed peas cole slaw and mac n cheese all were great probably the peas and greens being my favorites and the slaw being my girlfriend s first choice Two tables no seats Fine to eat standing up or as takeout The wait is about five minutes plus 3 5 minutes for every person in line in front of you If you re driving by and there s no one in here stop now even if you re not that hungry 
5Ex0KjJajkqMCz1OxiCUEw CMU The following review is based on an actual conversation if by actual you mean embellished for literary panache Primanti s is the best It s a Pittsburgh institution It s terrible The sandwiches are over rated It s a novelty act Screw you Bite me I can t believe I married you I can t believe I ever asked you to marry me This type of argument seems to abound on Yelp So just try Primanti s and decide for yourself I do agree that the cheesesteak isn t that great but I would highly recommend the capicola The spiciness of that meat works well with the coleslaw 
5ezcgooLgD2f3KYQKuWHzg CMU It s O K and that s about it The service is usually slow and it takes a while for them to even notice you are there Don t expect to get your water refiled promptly either However my main issue is the food it just is never quite right I hardly am satisfied with what I order either it s too bland or too salty or just not right I live close by and have come here a fair amount of time in the past three years so I have given Lulu s a fair try It s alright just don t expect greatness 
5fcvq8KEUIvreo7YxKsTIg CMU Beer menu is nice Beware Chicks behind the bar Have bad attitudes b 
5fXsy_FU9wMhqDfj8iDg2w CMU Since my first review I have done take out a few times at Sushi Too to validate my stance I have gotten the chirashi bowl and all is good There is a lot of fish and rice along with a salad and miso soup Sushi Too does the trick but I do feel that the chirashi is a bit expensive about 22 bucks I will continue to go to Sushi Too since it is close to home but still on the look out for my sushi place in the burgh 
5g95DteF19smNUfTYKRCAw CMU Too pricey for the quality 
5GMaWRyJ6bRo_kGsqDb1SA CMU I m having an affair A pizza affair I have forsaken my darling Adrian s for Angelo s And it s all because of a white pizza Okay for realz now Angelo s white pizza is ridiculously delicious It comes with tomatoes I added pepperoni cause I was feeling kinda wild When the pizza arrived and I opened the lid I had to gasp The cheese Ohh the glorious cheese There were regal mountains of ricotta Majestic valleys of melted mozzarella Fragrant Italian herbs infiltrated my nostrils Why am I using the word nostrils in a restaurant review Gross Anyway it took all my willpower not to have a pizza eating contest with myself right then and there You just have to try this pizza The crust the tomato and the pepperoni are all awesome too but trust me if you like cheese and who doesn t you ll love this On top of that their fries are fresh and served in lah arge portions and their steak cheese and mushroom sandwich is phenomenal I get it sans the tomato and lettuce but keep the onions and mayo The bread is all nice and toasty and I swear there s some secret ingredient in there that is a magical a flavor booster cause it s just SO delish 
5h0DwrrcWPARJ_bMfo5UOQ CMU I personally rarely come here specifically to eat I do love to come here for the atmosphere drinks girls Their waitresses are for the most part really hot The Food personally I like the combo of onion soup and the shady burger yea its not the best burger in town but its got a great taste to it Rest of their food is so so and some of it is down right awful but again i don t come here for the food The Atmosphere LOVE the atmosphere There is outdoor seating there are lots of windows there is a jukebox upstairs there is a fun bar area downstairs with lots of TV s so you can watch the game with buddies over some drinks There are always very attractive people here Waitresses really hot really nice great service This is def my favorite bar in shadyside but again I don t come here for the food except maybe the soup 
5H3TohWluEc-F7XUKYfvWg CMU This was my first time to Toast I was impressed overall and would certainly go back I enjoyed the pinot noir block nine as we waited just a few minutes for our table According to my friend the menu hadn t changed much since his last visit but I was still impressed as a first time patron We didn t opt for the tasting even though it was a Tuesday We had the fried green tomatoes with peach salsa as well as the shrimp and grits to start The shrimp and grits were fantastic I then had the beet salad and the hanger steak The steak was cooked to perfection and paired well with the bordeaux blend I sampled the duck confit and thought it was done well but not nearly as good as the steak The peanut butter ice cream sandwich was out of this world 
5HGWC1PcoVnav9lelKQIvw CMU Stopped in for a burger to go Staff were friendly and ordering process was super easy I ordered the bistro burger and it took about 10 minutes for it to be brought out to me which is fair for freshly made food It was interesting that despite the to go order they gave me a number and told me to sit down at a table Fortunately there were empty seats but I can imagine this might be tough if it s packed The bistro burger was tasty but the salt pepper crust on the burger was way too salty Maybe it was just a mistake on my burger but they shouldn t be severely over salting burgers Nonetheless Hello Bistro will get another hello from me pretty soon to give them another chance The build your own salads are worth a shot Update I went back to try the salad I got to customize what I had it in and that s fun After choosing everything the salad is chopped mixed and dressed by a chopper I thought the personal service was really great I got the feeling that the staff were genuinely interested in making the best salad for you I ate the salad until I was full and had enough leftover so that by adding some lettuce I had another lunch I m looking forward to saying Hello again to this place 
5HQNorckxxfRlrz-T3KKpw CMU This place was not nearly as gross as I anticipated In the middle of Oakland rusty sign I mean the place screams undergrad No thank you I was persuaded to go here one Friday after the semester was over for happy hour and had a good time I mean yes you can buy pitchers of shots here but you can also get Sam Adams in the 16oz super nice Sam Adams glass for 7 and keep the glass It s pretty big inside wasn t crowded or smokey and the food was not that bad for bar food I had a chicken bacon avocado wrap and it was tasty Friends had burgers and they cleaned their plates Hemingway s you went from hideous undergrad hangout in my mind to an establishment I would patronize 
5i5aWVlv5RIvAjLDmdx7dQ CMU I park outside on the street of Panera so I could run in and grab a bite to eat Well I didn t have quarters and when I asked the girl at the counter if I could exchange my dollar for 4 quarters so I could feed the meter while I ate she looked at me like I was crazy and said I can t give you change How the hell am I supposed to park and eat if I do not have change and you are unwilling to exchange a dollar for me I know it might be company policy to not open the register but do not roll your eyes at me and get an attitude Gracias para nada 
5ivIa4a6rcyqeeSl2RnP6Q CMU Half price wine bottles Wednesdays Get the shady sticks Eat em when they re still hot Yum 
5I__R1con_Eu86A0J9KaQQ CMU Oishii gets an extra star for cleanliness which is a rarity among Oakland s eateries I ve never had the sushi but the tempura vegetables are excellent fried to lightly golden perfection and not greasy I love that they offer miso soup only 1 I only wish the portions of kimchi were a little bigger but again it s also only 1 
5JA-7U3zbOsd-Gx073rJyg CMU How about McDonalds quality food at twice the price Unfortunately that is pretty much what you re getting at Panera these days I ve been a loyal Panera supporter since my highschool days so it pains me to say this but Panera you have truly lost your way I walked into Panera to grab a quick coffee and breakfast sandwich while I was working on a few things I decided to try the Breakfast Power Sandwich with a large coffee The sandwich was around 5 and the coffee was 2 so not exactly fast food prices or anything The coffee was amazing tons of different varieties and free refills It definitely helped to jump start my morning in a big way The sandwich though Completely different story It was half a piece of bread folded in half with a slice of lukewarm cheese and a paltry slice of ham Gross The bread wasn t toasted at all and it was just flat out disgusting Definitely one of the worst breakfast sandwiches I ve had in a while Panera has to seriously get some new cooks who uphold quality standards When I visit a higher end place like Panera I m expecting quality food not stuff that you could find at some fast food joint Unfortunately I ve had this scenario play out at Panera during my last 2 3 visits The food is just kinda thrown together not toasted or put together properly definitely won t be going back there anytime soon If I m gonna get crappy quality food I would rather just pay half the price and grab some Wendys Sorry Panera we re breaking up I ll call you sometime though maybe 
5JJSn_P_IsGtvGo-UpRS9w CMU I was happy with the food I got here it s pretty normal casual dining They re supposed to be well known for their desserts but as most other reviews will attest to there s nothing really special about the desserts 
5jxIs-FG8Osfut6-APsVyQ CMU I had such a great experience here a few nights back I ve been wanting to come here for dinner for quite some time and I guess I chose the right night They just started offering their new summer menu and it is fantastic I choose the 3 course Raw Menu sampler which lets you try everything on the raw menu for only 15 And I will add it was awesome I will note that if you are very hungry or have a big appetite you probably want to order something in addition to the sampler The starters included the Coconut Crusted Fried Onions which are dehydrated onions with a coconut breading and it is as satisfying as eating real onion rings except much healthier The first course also had the Cucomber and Watermelon soup which to me sounded unappetizing but was surprisingly good and Fresh Fruit with Goat Cheese which is not actually goat cheese but rather a cheese made from buts fruit and seeds The 2nd course was my favorite If I were to pick one of these entrees to order it would be a tough choice The Zucchini Ravioli is probably my favorite but the Nacho Bowl and Stuffed Tomatoes where also surprisingly delicious I don t typically eat vegan food so when I am eating nachos and don t even realize they are vegetarian there is a beet and pumpkin seed filling that you could mistake for beef it means it is a pretty good meal Lastly were the desserts This was my least favorite course but only because I have a major sweet tooth but also LOVE dairy and so it is really hard to thoroughly enjoy a vegan dessert That being said they were still good Service was also good both the hostess and waitress were very friendly and attentive 
5KfyU4V4lwCfhLOa_9YgxQ CMU I worked in Ali Baba in college and it set the gold standard for middle eastern food for me Every place I go I compare to Ali Baba and everywhere falls short I mean everywhere I mean sure I only worked there for three weeks before I broke my ankle and realized waiting tables would have to well wait and sure the kitchen staff doesn t necessarily have a western standard of respect for women but man they can cook some amazing food and they give you huge portions And when you re in college one enormous free meal every day goes a very long way Their hummous is unmatched Their baba is unmatched I have never found mohomara anywhere else I could go on Its really good and they have a ton of vegan food but also great food for meat eaters Just go already 
5LBio5PpkHzd6zU8jE-4yw CMU Maybe I m just spoiled but this place is sub par Been to the one in Sq Hill were there is line on the weekends and a wait of anywhere from 10 30 min I ve only been there when there was no line and I despise myself each time I finish my food thinking I could have gone home and put extra scoop of lard on my eggs and it would have cost less than 1 4 of what I payed at Pamela s 
--4ZeOLUj8XU86mUFFJMTA Columbia Our server was really really nice And the food came very quickly So that was all A OK I didn t love our food though We tried the bibimbap and it wasn t very flavorful though This is the first time I ve tried it so I m honestly not sure what it s supposed to taste like But I m guessing it s not supposed to be bland The appetizers and the soup that came with the meal were a lot better in my opinion 
--b0bnY1J8dE4NlCUsR-Pg Columbia Convenience store with all the things I love to munch on Shrimp chips Coffee things in cans Sushi to order Great bet to get a snack or a quick meal thing 
-08tPj7h6CmxsidEWPF6kg Columbia Lucky lucky me to live so close to this gem of an eatery Fantastic place to share a meal with friends or family I had not had Ethiopian cuisine before this place but have since in other establishments No one has yet compared to Zoma s flavors bright spiced perfectly subtle richness Great healthy sized portions too Their service is always friendly and the waitstaff is happy to recommend dishes suited to your cravings Upscale decor with reasonably priced meals and cocktails Go to ZOMA 
-0m1gIBZYugRW3_BIW_gig Columbia Have you ever seen a pizza as big as a man If not then go to Koronet s A single slice has the geographic area of 3 smaller slices put together with thin crust with just the right amount of crisp I first sampled koronet s after eating at Thai Market in the Upper West Side We skipped dessert and opted for pizza instead The sickness that followed was worth every bite 
-0TPsW9pF2h83XdIkkrr8A Columbia This spot is adorable It has the feel of being inside a vintage jewelry box if you had been shrunken down like the fairies in Sleeping Beauty The yellow walls beautiful light fixtures and charming details throughout Campo made me feel cozy and excited for a great time The food was delicious even though I made the odd and not to be repeated choice of Sweet Polenta It wasn t bad just too dessert y for a main course even at brunch All you can drink brunch alcohol at 9 90 was a plus The only downside was disinterested and slow service In fact we got some tude from a waiter because we asked for bread when we weren t his table Poor form So I hope the service improves if not I may have to lose a new favorite brunch option 
-108yMSyt-UUyvYtqcPxFg Columbia As other reviewers have noted this place is SUCH a bargain Just to gloss over the highlights 20 prix fixe from 6 8 BYOB with no corkage fee great service and adorable set up I heart the location because it s near my hood I went there on a Thursday night with my supper club there were 6 of us and we all enjoyed it immensely Clearly it s darn popular the place was completely full when we took our leave at 9 30 PM The place is impressive for its originality The menu is classic quality ORGANIC French food but with a Carribean twist For instance the pate is not like any other pate I ve ever had It is an amalgamation of deliciousness it has a BRIE crust yum I thought the cheese made the dish a bit oily but that didn t stop me from asking my dinner companion for a second taste Or a third Also their home style meatloaf is seitan rather than meat and was one of the best dishes I sample I supremely enjoyed my appetizer and entree I opted for the grilled hass avocado and the roast duck leg confit The appetizer was divinity herself I have never tasted anything like it in my life With each bite I closed my eyes and attempted to dissect each component in the shitake sesame dressing I however was distracted by the sheer pleasure of the flavor combination and failed in this mission The duck leg confit was good The flavor was right on but the duck was a bit overcooked for my taste My meal here was a blast I d recommend this place to anyone Of course the 4 bottles of wine my party finished off could be a contributing or convoluted if you will factor towards my attitude 
-1fCWRFoZ69sqOYiPb6yeA Columbia I had brunch with my sister here a couple of days ago and the food was scrumptious I had a mozzarela sandwich with roasted tomatoes and peppers And my sister had an eggs benedict 
-1Mz7H7oDr8hFMqTRvL4EQ Columbia Aloo anything and Lamb roti rolls are the way to go Add goat cheese for that extra flava Their mango lassi isn t that great but ok in a pinch if it s 3 AM and you re thirsty Gotta love Indian fast food 
-2_xNAFEh8Qt2jsdvyC2hA Columbia I m all for the benefit of the doubt so it was hard for me to give it 2 stars but as adorable as this restaurant is It really wasn t the best experience which could account for all the open seats on a Friday night The menu is a conglomerate of American and Japanese I tend to fear any amalgamated menus It usually means the restaurant isn t sure what it wants to be and therefore is not good at being anything at all I went with the American side of the menu Started with Coconut shrimp and dumplings Both seemed pre made not the worst taste just nothing special although my date enjoyed the dumplings For entrees it was the burger and Jambalaya The entrees were as the appetizers unexciting The Jambalaya was a large portion but pretty soupy and low on shrimp sausage and anything other than rice and liquid The burger laid quietly next to the fries hoping that who ever came in contact with it would be hungry enough to devour it I d love to say that since we were one of the only two tables that we received exceptional service I cannot Our server changed 3 times from seating and drinks to actual ordering Luckily we weren t in a hurry or super thirsty because after our food was dropped off We were left to our own devices we were there for an hour and to an angry waitress who would ve much rather lit candles than drop our check 
-3Jr74objsR5HJP27XhzqA Columbia We went on the third day that they were open I was very pleased to see by the prices that it is not trying to be a destination restaurant which is exactly what this neighborhood needs It reminded me of Fiore in Brooklyn which also has a standard menu and a good price point I spoke to one of the owners who said that there are three owners one of whom is the chef They are experienced owners who have had at least four other restaurants on the West side They came here because of the reasonable rents For all those who were wondering the reason it took so long was that they had to bring the building up to code He said it cost them a lot of time and money It was obviously a headache They don t have their license yet BYOW more furniture is coming and they have plans to open for lunch and breakfast but the owner said Let s get dinner right first They would like to do pizza too but that seemed further down the road The side door indicates that there might be outdoor seating come spring The room is spacious loud and weirdly bright the last perhaps to let people know they are open or because it was so early We ate with the family crowd and there were over a dozen kids when we left A family of four can afford to eat here at 9 a pasta which I think will help ensure their success I had the veggie lasagna which was nice and flavorful and yes had peas which is a weird touch but the lasagna was light enough that I didn t care The plain spaghetti was tasty and filling and easy for kids to eat The puttanesca was tasty and not too salty which it often is but the meat lasagna and ragu were a little over salted The service was attentive and friendly Butter with the bread no olive oil Overall it was incredibly satisfying to sit on FDB and have a decent meal at a reasonable price I would say they hit the mark on one of the services that this neighborhood has been missing Now if they could only get a pizza oven Welcome Frizzante 
-42oDLhMJiZnTniQuaX58w Columbia If you really hate yourself and those around you please come here for lunch and remember to order the lukewarm and viscous thai curry 
-44qH1H5LaW530X9QmIgeQ Columbia A place where you can actually find something for everyone Creole American Mexican and even Japanese Another great find where most of the entrees are under 20 The soft spoken waiter excelled at his job Bread basket was great I finally found cornbread I like The creole chicken and shrimp with red pepper chipotle sauce was off the hook You get a lot of food enough for lunch the next day Comes with lump free mashed potatoes and delicious spinach that soaked up all of the garlic I will recommend this place to my friends up there and cannot wait to come back Dunno about the lounge though 
-4NNj9_J_ILWaWWzYrQvxg Columbia When they say Giant Burrito you better believe you are getting a giant burrito This isn t any Chipotle burrito this is huge Also it s great for vegetarians and it s totally two meals worth of food Delish horchata 
-4xxufc8Mjl5ICTLorv4jQ Columbia If you re looking for brunch on the UWS then I recommend you spend a couple extra bucks at Community across the street it is worth it It pains me that I m considered a regular here because I only ever come here under protest my darling wife loves meeting people for brunch Seriously go to Community instead it is more expensive but worth it Deluxe is a big letdown 
-5Y2Ki_0i1YALt6cZZPOmg Columbia I love this place I don t go as often as I used to because I moved a little further away and I ll caution that it is pretty expensive But I don t know a place that makes a better sandwich Their Italian tuna is the best tuna I ve had Their soups are also amazing They taste homemade there s always 4 5 different varieties and a quart with free bread goes a long way My one gripe makes me sound like a curmudgeon but everything keeps changing there Some of the changes are good sure the increased selection the addition of a sushi chef their willingness to sell slices of whole cakes instead of insisting you buy the whole beautiful costly thing But I ll end up trying a new product that looks delicious and high quality only to see it disappear shortly after Peppermint ice cream I m thinking of you It s also much harder to justify the prices now that they ve done away with their frequent shopper cards 
-5z-2YPiSLF5lQh8czHjZA Columbia ollie s works just fine if you happen to be at columbia university and need a quick bite the food is perfectly acceptable but nothing special on that basis i would have given it three stars the problem though is this busy eatery feels kind of dirty you wouldn t really feel that if you were doing takeout but the last two times that i ate there i sat at the back of the restaurant from there i got a full view of the bathroom doors and the messy stack of spare chairs etc this restaurant need to be a little better organized 
-6whHrTnakGO512T7dJC_Q Columbia Slice of Harlem is perhaps the worst expensive pizza I have ever had When I moved to this neighborhood I was disappointed beyond belief After visiting Pizzeria 123 with a friend I realized good pizza for inexpensive amounts of money is hard to find Pizzeria 123 has pizza rice and beans for real hamburgers fries etc etc Yes it s nothing classy or something I die for on a Friday night but when I m hungry I ll be here Plus it s close by 
-6xpZtLRmEEsVgrZokqHCw Columbia First off I m not a big fan of the location of R S but beside that the food is quality So when we sat down we were asked for drinks and greeted with warm biscuits Which I was EXTREMELY weary off considering that southern biscuits are usually really doughy But I noticed they were light and fluffy and they also have some sort of sweet glaze on top Delicious point blank Then came our ribs which were amazing and the sides mac and cheese potato salad collards all were to die for The chicken smothered and fried are both wonderful The chicken is not oily but just right and tender as well as perfectly seasoned Everything was great But I have heard from my friend who introduced me to the place at first that it is not as good as it used to be Now i don t know what this is about but i will say this much I think another visit will do this place justice And the decor is nothing too drastic to comment on so all in all I m a fan 
-7F14FbLo-LKy2MlqEp9KA Columbia Stopped by this place for a drink because I was in the area and the place looked inviting Great move the staff was very friendly and welcoming Happy hour was awesome not to mention it was lobster night yummy Live music open air friendly faces good drinks and pretty good food Go for it 
-7l6i45Zsat3oqmanUXZ5g Columbia Oh Milano Market Your amazing soups and unlimited bread slices have been there for me when it was 20 degrees outside and I needed to be warm Your fabulous salads fed me when I had nothing else to eat And the sandwiches Don t even get me started on the sandwiches The boyfriend always orders the chicken parm because he is unimaginative but lately he discovered the pastrami which is excellent I m more of a turkey girl myself but I do love how each sandwich maker finds a way to make the same turkey brie and honey mustard unique And then there is the bakery The chocolate cheesecake is to die for I haven t done much grocery shopping there but I do love how they have the most random things like Kinder surprise that I can t find anywhere else even though they were such a huge part of my childhood Milano I will love you forever and always Please never change 
-7unsnDYnnsUyjIqUqgcrw Columbia We got the groupon and went here tonight for our anniversary dinner the view is great the decor very old and the atmosphere was very strange Outside it seems to be much nicer than in side but there was no serving Service was pretty good and fast Food was average we branzino fish it was tasty but very small i had veal it was good on some parts other parts were raw and not eatable for me the wine list is very small we had to ask for it We will not go again i don t think it s romantic like others here most people were above 50 at the place there a tons of better places in the city they are overpriced i like to spend on good food but this food should be 15 less per entree 
-8MwIPChqAB2BZo98NViUA Columbia The food is mediocre but we ve been using them because they accept credit cards and we rarely keep cash on us DO NOT USE A CREDIT CARD HERE I had two orders within five days and wound up being charged three times twice for two different amounts on the same day I called them and the manager said he runs the receipts at the end of the night himself and that sometimes this happens Would I please wait one week and see if it came off This was the FIRST warning it happens sometimes He s obviously doing something wrong Well it was fair to wait so I did I called him a week later when the amount still hadn t come off He was obviously annoyed with me and got very short on the phone He kept insisting I do nothing illegal over and over I replied that I understood that but there had been a mistake and it needed to be fixed The amount was 36 20 and had come directly out of my checking account I wasn t happy He insisted the credit card company had looked into it and was working on the 20 00 mistake I reminded him that it was 36 20 and he started getting even louder with me We ended it with him giving me his cell number so I could send him a screen shot of my statement that clearly showed the three charges I sent it to him and waited two days to hear from him When I didn t hear from him I texted him since I always called at a bad time for him his words asking if he had a refund for me yet I waited another day and STILL did not hear from him Hence my reviews here If this is how he conducts business at this restaurant STAY AWAY There are MANY better places to get good Chinese food from This place has neither good food nor good business practices 
-9gjViwgOdEwiuct55XBOA Columbia I was excited o try Mel s Burger Bar so I went with two friend on Saturday night That will be the last time I go there In their defense it was busy But crowded on a Saturday night is no excuse for miserable service It was hard to get our server s attention He was quite nice when he came by but he didn t come by enough I ordered a beer they have a permanent menu with a great selection of beers and they had just finished the keg After I changed my order to a shake I thought about it and got confused were they really out of one of the beers on their permanent menu If it was just an issue of changing out the keg I would have waited I did end up waiting anyway Our food took an obscene amount of time After we ordered we waited They brought my shake I drank my shake My friends finished their drinks And we waited And more waiting And no food Our waiter began avoiding eye contact When we did get his attention he totally sold the kitchen down the river saying Yeah I have no idea what s up in there They re really slow tonight Maybe that s true dude but maybe you should have apologized to us rather than commiserating as though you re suffering too Finally finally our food came Well most of it Their menu specifically states that all burgers are medium unless you ask for something different One of us had ordered her burger rare and yet all three of our burgers were cooked to different temperatures Mine was rare one was well done and the friend who wanted rare got medium She sent it back They apologized We waited And waited Her burger came back a second time and was not what she ordered She took it anyway we d been waiting more than 30 minutes for food at that point but we were all disappointed They comped her burger fwiw You know what the worst part was The burgers were good Like really good But it wasn t enough sadly It didn t compensate for bad service an unnecessarily loud environment where you couldn t hear anyone speak or the fact that the place turned into a hip bar with people standing around drinks in hand bumping against tables 
-9v5sjnEpqfhFsOzZ-nr2Q Columbia Great food Great service Wonderful atmosphere Been here many times My only two nits 1 Their menu is a bit limited Could use a few more choices 2 They do not accept American Express at last check but it has been a good few months since I ve been there 
-A1ALp8D_uJKPlA3mH9JnA Columbia Nothing special to note Typical Dive bar 
-aduu0ZQLVLM6BTZjitA-Q Columbia Ate here for restaurant week two summers ago before I discovered yelp and it looks like they have since closed We came for the view which we couldn t enjoy because of a storm and then were seated inside right next to the 90 year old harp player Soup was cold entrees were bland the seat cushions had stains on them and the worst part is there was a fly flying around our table Hope the new management makes necessary updates and takes advantage of that space 
-AEXfzPuwLyqkx_KLSHH2Q Columbia Casual nice setting on a calm block and the food is delish Presentation was on point and I had the baked lasagna which was probably THEE best lasagna I ve ever had the pleasure of consuming smh still thinkin about it 
-AfCBkLvS6yrpPi5Kcb9Kw Columbia I love getting breakfast delivered from Hamilton Quick friendly delivery guys and cheap considering other options around here HOWEVER ever since the girl that use to take the orders over the phone left the gentleman that now takes orders cannot seem to get it right Mind you he messed up once before and I was forgiving So on my second order I said it slow and repeated it he still messed up my order argh Hamilton do something about him 
-AhwIxS6dgEGqiz5GhgYtA Columbia Slices the size of the Bronx Q How does Koronet keep the price so low on a slice so big while featuring such high quality ingredients A They don t Like so much else in life Koronet Pizza obeys the law that what can t be done isn t So don t imagine you are getting top quality ingredients If you want to maximize calories per dollar this is your place If you just need some modestly healthy cheap eats in the neighborhood try Maoz across the street Jerusalem falafel and more on Broadway between 103 104 or check out La Fonda Mexicana on Amsterdam near 108 
-aLQrrhSVxSPiTjXxxGc5Q Columbia The menu is a little uninspired and the flavor of the food does not warrant the price tag Nice ambiance good service 
-bdpFpaPrOPnM-faFbWLrg Columbia Do you like having the option to drink great beer or crappy beer sit next to a happy young couple or a pack of brahs know exactly when you re in the best table in the corner on the roof or worst table the one by the front door The Heights is downright schizophrenic Sometimes it s really nice sometimes it s a pain The food ranges from pretty tasty jerk chicken to standard fried whatever and of course they ve got what you re really looking for which is above average sports bar fare I love rooftop dining and drinking and this place has a very comfortable roof so I ll end up there pretty often if I m out with a group whose tastes I don t know that well 
-bgxDvpmcAt6UJuH5COInQ Columbia Ollie s is a joke amongst the Chinese citizens of the Columbia community They make fun of this place for claiming to serve Chinese food and they laugh about the clueless American diners who pay to eat it I have to admit that a few years ago I would stop by Ollie s for their spinach wonton soup on weekends However I was also on a strict diet at the time and noticed that I enjoyed every source of nourishment immensely In any case Ollie s has failed to impress me with any of their other dishes Their pork buns have little filling and are strangely sour wtf I once tried to order the General Tso s Chicken Americanized Chinese at its best and partway through eating the first piece I realized it was not fully cooked I cut all the other nuggets in half on my plate and discovered that 100 of them had bright pink middles What s really strange is that the cooked parts of the chicken were extremely dry which confused me about as much as the first time I had a Baked Alaska how do they bake ice cream cake without having it melt Another time I got their Taro Bubble Tea no bubbles Really if I had wanted a glass of milk with some purple food coloring I could have gotten it a lot cheaper at Morton Williams In any case I keep being forced to go to lunch meetings at this place and it upsets me because I really want Ollie s go out of business so a real restaurant can take over this little corner 
-Bi_c6qJ9MvzymhyS4e6Bg Columbia the live music was awesome but don t sit too close to the stage or you won t hear your party the food was scrumptious and the drinks were made to perfection the crowd was young diverse and professional i can t say enough about this place 
-boMFS0BkY21bQa8zR6FDg Columbia It makes me so happy to see a banh mi shop in the neighborhood The sandwich isn t 100 authentic I go to Chinatown Seattle southern California or Saigon for that but Q Q is so much better than Subway and even Lenny s I don t live within their delivery radius but they will deliver if I ask nicely and order a minimum of 15 The two people who have answered the phone when I ve called are very friendly So I order 3 sandwiches at a time one to eat immediately and the other two refrigerate well You can pop them in the oven to toast them up to a day or two later I ve also ordered the wings and chicken tenders from there Those aren t too good though Stick to the sandwiches 
-bOMpQ8jX4RUb-YDLNZRCg Columbia Definitely a trip down college memory lane which oversized bar food and huge frozen drinks This is a nice place to casually hang out with a group of friends for a descent price Don t expect phenomenal food drinks but instead cheap prices and a super casual environment 
-BsvdDYsZ86z6Y4YAfWajA Columbia The food was so good I shouldve given 5 stars but the service is weak If they improve their service they would be unstoppable I got the Jerk chicken and it was the best I have had in the States The yams are also super sweet and yummy Love this place and I will be back despite the wack service 
-CiAdd1zfd5QgVwDOSWniA Columbia The food was very tasty great price and big portions Its a very laid back atmosphere The service is a bit slow and the waiter messed up our order bringing stewed chicken instead of jerk chicken and tried to play if off like she brought jerk She also messed up our side orders but the food was so tasty we didnt care Will def go back and try to put more emphasis on the sides 
-Cje6v2ztKfeHl5kLEdFtA Columbia Their garlic bread is to die for This is all you should come here for Their pasta was average and a weird mix of watery but also too creamy GET THE GARLIC BREAD 
-cwMBp-Fr2FiSRcfpwML3A Columbia this place is pretty cool granted i didnt try any of the food but the ambiance is great they have a solid beer selection as well as some nightly specials this place is a very solid spot to come to and this is when it was cold out they have a fairly large outdoor area for seating and im sure during the spring summer times its pretty bumping i hope to try this place out again most definitely 
-CWYIjz9lyJf7B35m0AqPw Columbia Crepes on Columbus is a cute little establishment I ve passed by it on several occasions and have always thought about trying it After seeing a Groupon offer it was just meant to be I came here for late lunch with my bf on a Monday afternoon and we were the only ones there I ordered a savory crepe with smoked salmon and basil cream It was seriously out of this world amazing My bf who attests crepes and anything creamy was also in love I am definitely coming back for the food and the service was just the cherry on top 
-cx3ilWSfur8c_w2wG3NKA Columbia Happy hour drink specials only downstairs not on the roof Very tasty frozen drinks that due lead to high levels of intoxication Strangely enjoyed the Salisbury fries served with gravy Food is so so and it is a lot of barely legal or not yet legal college kids for the most part 
-dH7qEOGhTFUBAg5PVBvnw Columbia i usually don t give 2 star reviews unless the place really bothered me while that is not true of the thai market the pad thai was 3 star and 10 price made it 2 star come to think of it i guess i ve only had pad thai at once place oh well it s better there 
-DlE9nZKQi7XzWSEvkPWhw Columbia Beautifuly decorated Don t come here if you re hungry though We waited about 45 minutes to get our food during Sunday brunch hour The burger was decent but nothing special Please hire some more staff 
-DRkoQZXKT98SpbqMtm4lQ Columbia The food here is amazing and reasonably priced Try the eggplant for an appetizer and then the pasta dishes are perfect fresh ravioli is great 
-dwIaF5_Nl9IML4mFg57GA Columbia Great little bistro in the middle of Columbia area The hostess was efficient and promptly seated us It was interesting that the restaurant ran out of scallops so for their Cioppino entree they are just going to drop them For 28 5 you d think they d offer to adjust That said ordered the pork chop and the skirt steak both of which were great The pork belly salad was not so great I understand pork belly to be fatty but for the salad we got slabs of pork fat Table set up is also weird as no one got salt or pepper and it takes the wait staff a bit of time to hunt pepper down Overall average to slow service but friendly 
-dWvOvG7FVsF-T_0JkZVkg Columbia Amazingly good Mexican in NYC I m a Cali girl at heart and I love a REAL burrito and this is the best I ve had in the Northeast I went to Tortilleria Nixtamal in Queens because of all the hype and was disappointed but without fanfare this place is the real deal 
-e6OIjNhi62ZdbBuk6W9xQ Columbia I found a curly hair baked into my empanada Sure it s not as bad as the knife a poor man found in his sandwich at Subway but jaysus you would think they would not have such problems with premade food during opening week After apologizing and giving me another order the staff nervously proclaimed that this has never happened Whatever Maybe they should wear hairnets it wouldn t clash that much with the Pinkberry inspired decor The empanadas I tried Chicken Argentine Beef and Caprese mozzerella basil tomato were dry and lacked flavor I had to drink a 1 2 bottle of guava juice to impart some moisture to the filling At 3 38 a pop it s still an offense to get food this bad especially when Roti Roll is just 2 blocks away 
-E7sGLueiBb7CDpdemSrwQ Columbia I know how do you go to a burger bar and not get a burger I don t really know I can explain except for saying I just wasn t in the mood for a burger Things I ate that you ll definitely like sweet potato fries buffalo chicken wings and fried Oreos not the best I ve had but pretty awesome Things I ate that you might like fish tacos a little bland and I don t like corn tortillas the cabbage and avocado were a nice touch turkey burger Things I ate that you can skip bbq chicken sliders overly saucy not much going on besides chicken and bread needed lettuce and tomato Things I ll eat next time a burger Happy eating 
-ea-94M0jT5TDhyo-WGOgQ Columbia It s really the only place around here you can get some of these items Prices tend to be pretty good for the supermarket section Not sure about the deli or sushi I like the drink selection as well 
-ECSF0iJL6ygLgnkj6uGaw Columbia how common 
-eEoyYBgx4lr5XtYava6sw Columbia So full But so right I stopped by with a friend earlier this evening to grab a bite before heading home it s a Sunday night after all and we were curious to try the place after hearing so much about it Am I glad I did We ordered the Big Mel 10 oz burger w Wisconsin bacon and all the type of cheese they had in house the cowboy bacon mushrooms chili onion strings on a 10 oz burger and the disco fries gravy scallions melted cheese Plus milkshakes and we were rolling home And did I mention they sell growlers of beer 
-EkFAP8WuHQua_OlyPVt0A Columbia I was just here for lunch Cute space and not too crowded though that could be because Columbia s out for the summer The wine the server recommended was definitely not bad The grilled calamari was tasty but it was really a salad though not advertised as such A ton of lettuce but a very small portion of squid We both had pasta mains that were good enough but nothing special Service is friendly if hovering 
-ELk3wYLvwPV9ccvl2WBPA Columbia The burgers are a bit small but extremely satisfying We strolled into Mel s yesterday for the first time At first we were a bit apprehensive due to the volume of the music but my hunger desire for a burger won out and we got a table My husband started with Popcorn Shrimp and I with Buffalo Wings Both were excellent Peter went onto a Cadillac Burger and I the California Equally Excellent We loved the food and the atmosphere once the music was turned down The service was adequate Prices are a bit high but aren t they high everywhere I ll pay the price for food this good 
-eta-4DMn2ZVQ92R9vXuEQ Columbia I enjoyed a relaxing hot tea and appetizers here after a long day of work and evening classes My friend enjoyed a cold beer but it s allergy season so I had a hankering for a hot tea We were lucky that it was late enough a little after 9pm to snag a spot outdoors I have walked by Amsterdam Restaurant Tapas Lounge many times and never knew how great their menu was I should have know it was more than just outdoor seating that keeps this place busy at all hours This will certainly become one of my favorite post class spots to unwind and enjoy good food 
-ffCqnLt6LVDmfm79CHfZw Columbia Unlike other reviewers I m not a big fan of Korean food but every so often I get an urge to give it another try Everyone else seems to like it a lot right Plus Mill is right by my school and reasonably inexpensive It would be great if I could eat there Community Kitchen was closed one day when I was really hungry so I came over to Mill instead The first thing I noticed was that in addition to being unfamiliar with the menu there are roughly two things on the menu that are vegetarian friendly namely hot and cold kimchee bibimbap I chose cold randomly and got a bowl of lettuce with kimchee tofu and various vegetables The tofu was pretty good maybe homemade But after a few bites I was struck by the blandness of it all The most interesting part of the meal was the complimentary side dishes of spicy and regular kimchee bean sprouts spicy tofu and tiny fish which I didn t eat I definitely ate more of them than my main dish Unfortunately within a few hours I started feeling sick and could only attribute it to eating a bunch of spicy fermented cabbage on a stomach full of lettuce Mission not accomplished 
-ftConQc_IgSU3bgTdxa4w Columbia It s a problem when you don t even want to try the fresh squeezed OJ The waitress had some sort of rash all over both hands and handled the top of my glass like it was her lover s handles I didn t want to even eat after that but persisted The omelet and accompaniments were on the below average side for diner food 12 for brunch with no booze This is a 2 star spot dropped to a 1 star by fungus hands stroking where my lips should go I didn t take a single sip of that OJ There are better spots No need to try 
-FyOh2XMTlNIJHs8W2EPJw Columbia Pinnacle has good bagels with cream cheese and they are cheap Their pizza is ok The frozen yogurt is good The service is usually okay but be careful because they sometimes try to rip you off on the bread that comes with pasta meals And napkins The best part is that they are open all the time 
-G0Qs29udj7BSvz0bdmb6g Columbia What a great variety Although I never deviate from my usual twice baked potatoe and raspberry crumb cake A tiny bit on the expensive side but not egregiously so 
-gqmPziPENHvA7yvEAi38Q Columbia Tried the lamb burger with the feta cheese and pesto The cheese was Boursin soft and whipped The pesto was not advantageous A medium rare Burger taste and grill texture was not pronounced It reminded me of a burger I would get from Applebees I arrived at opening My waitstaff Sheree was not assertive She was more of an order taker The staff could have been tense since their bosses were present inside Th outdoor patio is well worth it though It started to drizzle and the umbrella was fantastic Six Point on tap is always worth sitting for This bar is very smoothed out conservative and polished Almost to the point of generic The outdoor scene makes up I enjoy meeting Harlem s diversity here That in itself makes the place a winner 
-gV_7f_SLdWtsyPupM5JSQ Columbia This restaurant has the dubious distinction of being the only bad Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at Don t waste your money Steer clear of this place It was so bad I didn t even bring home the leftovers The sauces are bland imitations of what they are supposed to be the veggies seem to have been frozen yuck 
-H96tv8mi-l9Xu8t6E9X2A Columbia Love this place The pizza is AMAZING And not particularly pricey especially considering the quality It can take a while because they are cooked to order but so worth it I daydream about this pizza Order an appetizer and a pizza and that is great for 2 with a little to take home Well under 40 including a drink for each person 
-hKIQpdfoH7cvyDGB4w8rg Columbia Such Good Breakfast My friend I went here a couple months ago for breakfast and it made our entire day She ordered blueberry pancakes and I ordered the homemade french toast with strawberries I don t really know what hers tasted like because I was too busy demolishing my delicious meal but she said it was fantastic And if it were on the same level as my french toast I have to believe her 
-hlj3gYjYcjBIQ73fV38Zg Columbia There are a bunch of things that I appreciate about Tomo It s tasty both the cooked dishes and the sushi bar dishes It s consistent definitely not the best sushi in New York but I can always rely on Tomo to be satisfied It s fast I ve never had to wait more the 40 minutes for delivery and the service when I ve sat there has been great Overall much better than Cafe Swish across the street and probably the best sushi in the area of its class I love Saji s but that little hole in the wall cheap spot is kind of in a class of its own 
-hlQvzWK8uHy9fAxt8keFA Columbia Great for brunch 
-HYNgTMblR2palBlcaXWWw Columbia Where to begin the food is so so and the service is unbelievably awful I have ordered the same meal 3 times and it has yet to be what I wanted Delivery well they said 20 minutes and a full hour later it was delivered by a guy who didn t have change I can t see them being in business for long 
-HzsxUVID_gptFTSoRz0mQ Columbia I wish I could give it two and a half stars if only because the lunch specials are cheap but involve a huge amount of food but the food isn t that great hence the two star rating The fried rice is mostly miss and never actually tastes fried Today my fried rice had clumps of untouched white rice spread throughout Not so tasty The wonton soup can be kind of tasteless but the chicken with broccoli is good The brown sauce totally covers some of the blandness of the rice Also they give out fortune cookies which makes me happy as the places near my apartment don t do that so lame 
-ifmSpUvvS0q3Jc5vzv0xg Columbia The location is convenient but the sushi is not so good it tastes bland and the crab is fake but at least it s fake fresh crab Not for me though The place itself is cute and the staff is generous and nice 
-IlPMI0I1asgtzYXizqLoQ Columbia its nearness cheapness and speed make it irresistible Columbia but they once sent me a soup that had an industrial size like 4 inch rusty STAPLE floating in it When I called to tell them this they said So don t eat it How s that for great customer service 
-ItfJrQBXbp2titaSMe98A Columbia The service at Tom s is deplorable I went there with my wife after a long night of drinking to get some greasy diner food I had always wanted to try this place out for two reasons First I live ten blocks away Second I am a fan of Seinfeld Upon arriving my wife went to use the restroom and I ordered a coffee and juice The surly woman they employ for customer dis service approached me and asked to take my order I told her I was waiting on my wife and she left in a huff About a minute later my wife arrived at the table and before she could even set her purse down the server was asking for our order My wife asked for a few minutes and as the gal walked away she said Why dont you just take all day No need for a play by play but it really didnt get any better than that This snarky hag did not receive a dime from me and that was the first time in 26 years I have ever stiffed a server Do yourself a favor Take your picture of the facade and then go eat at any one of the half dozen restaurants within two blocks Were it not for Seinfeld this diner would have been closed ten years ago 
-iynp8jPI4P7Ny2m1Y_2GA Columbia The food was okay I was in a rush and had to wait almost 15 minutes for a sandwich not because of a line but because it took that long to grill chicken I should have ordered a panini from the case 
-IzhO5BLmLyH6bupN9F0sA Columbia Though I would not say it is the best in the city it does stand out for selling novelty size pizza with out loosing out on the taste and hey the prices aren t to expensive Also they make a decent Sicilian slice 
-j0HQpIyfcy1noxNLFLQJw Columbia This needs to be appended merged with the more extensive listing for Taqueria Y La Fonda La Mexicana New York http www yelp com biz taqueria y fonda la mexicana new york 
-jpcitdBdCrbZ7y99VsXHw Columbia Dear Koronet Thank you for feeding me on those hard to pay rent months You are delicious And after I eat a full slice I always have an inflated sense of self worth Maybe not the BEST pizza in NYC but where else can you get a slice the size of a small child 
-K1AgpLZ9t0k_E2tzyk-Aw Columbia I had eaten food here dozens of times before ever stepping foot in it Back in college I d order about once a week because of their efficient delivery reasonable prices and way above average food for the Morningside area Became addicted to the the steamed dumplings which are a perfect balance of healthy and delicious Maybe the best Pad Thai I ve had in the city Thankfully non of the food is too greasy a common problem for great Thai food and everything looks and tastes fresh Excellent Thai Ice Tea So after god knows how many times ordering in I walked all 10 blocks from my apartment to the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised It has somewhat upscale and modern design great photos on the wall well designed menus and great service More than an acceptable place to take dates and even took my parents there once 
-KpZi5bSc1b9Y6qfh1GRYw Columbia Apple Tree is a big deal When I meet people who used to live in my neighborhood and I want to explain my current location it s the siren I reference first Not near Columbia but around the corner from Apple Tree They ve got everything and then some it s the only place in the neighborhood that reliably stocks Morningstar crumbles the Met supermarket down the street meanwhile is the only place that reliably stocks Morningstar bacon You can take care of your staples here and dress it up with some of the pretty extras they also take care of anyone shopping Kosher The produce selection is uneven but the hummus spice rack fancy cheese selection is a strong They also have all sorts of odd household goods tucked around so if you re in need of a paring knife you can get that Prices are no worse than Morton Williams actually they can be slightly better If you re bargain hunting though walk over to Met Apple Tree recently knocked out a wall the one that used to divide them from the dry cleaner that moved up the block a couple years ago and they ve expanded the deli area There s now a huge amount of space to stand while you wait for your veggie burger or a huge amount of space to maneuver around people waiting for their veggie burgers and today I noticed they ve even added stools and a shelf like counter Apple Tree has been growing steadily for years remember when it wasn t 24 hours me either but it wasn t and I d go so far as to call them a neighborhood fixture In a neighborhood defined by waves of temporary residents that s a big deal 
-KQbDmZDhRE5yt2R0d1Gbw Columbia Bier is a nice indoor beer garden up in Harlem Their food is good especially the brats and the beer selection is good as well I first went last year when my friends who live nearby discovered it The great thing about it being indoors is that it s open in the winter too 
-kuaP6ZacsRU2KcrLOOHyA Columbia The roof deck has been closed for a private party everytime I ve gone here so that s been kinda lame The cheap margaritas from a slushie dispensor is a nice change of pace Its definitely a Columbia hangout spot which is fun if you meet people without their heads up their asses Decent place to watch a game on the tv s A good bar to hit up while bar hopping the area 
-KXkpg_wqcoNVpM5LC602A Columbia What a cute find Reasonably priced wide delivery area and oh so delicious Be advised that if you are far away from their location it will take some time to get to you The first experience I had was in the actual location the place is clean and staff is friendly Very simply decorated but who cares because they have delicious crepes a good size great ingredients and a side of a fresh salad with balsamic vinaigrette YUM 
-LfmhQ72uDNYrZ-pcM2LHA Columbia Nothing to jump up and down about but a perfect addition to this neighborhood Cafe Bagutta has warm friendly service a casual atmosphere and you can t beat the price for the food quality They are super accommodating and deserve more patronage than they seem to be getting Definitely a good place to stop for a casual breakfast before a day of studying in the library Recommend Signature Salad Dinner sized delicious salad with an incredible balsamic reduction for less than 7 Spinach and Goat Cheese Omelet is also delicious 
-Li5VCDxMM7RE_20qfZR0w Columbia I had the potato onion tart appetizer and the salade Nicoise Service was pretty slow portions were small for the price The food tasted good but not exceptionally so I might come back to try the moules frites but with so many other choices nearby it could be a while 
-LjtU0SqTvFVx2XCnO-NhA Columbia Totally not appreciate this shop at all Bad service to stay or to go The dilervery guy shouted at me and my friend because he is not happy about the tip There s another time that we ordered a noodle soup and it tasted sour We are unhappy about the meal and one of the guy told us maybe it s because that we are not used to this flavor You could always get better food around the neighborhood Just can t get it why is this restaurant so fasinated by Columbia s students The only food you can give it a try is the beef noodle soup though it s greasy 
-mDQ9LKnC5FoDqyWlfV3Tg Columbia I love the food here but the delivery service sucks they were very rude which is unfortunate because I love the food 
-mjnJXGiBAdh2iATd7t4ew Columbia Got the beef basil lunch special here Very mediocre spicing and not particularly fresh ingredients And they didn t have chili peppers in fish sauce That s like a diner not having ketchup I ve eaten at the Wondee in Midtown West and was satisfied so this was a big dissapointment 
-moovuJ2KKpBPwjz7KaOww Columbia I may think this place is more awesome than it is because I m in desperate need of anything that reminds me of my beloved Paris and this cafe in fact does remind me of Paris The tables are small and close together The service is bad The food is good All classic French cafe attributes Honestly though I went on a warm evening and sat outside I was hungry and very easy to please The atmosphere was great and the food even better My warm goat cheese salad was delicious and the burgers all looked great The next time I have a desire to run to the airport and book a ticket to Paris I ll just head uptown Its much more credit card friendly 
-n3Czfv1ibCesQ3nVcvofg Columbia I had the pleasure of living in the Barnard dorm above Ollie s one sweltering summer I will never forget the smell of Ramen in the elevator every single day And that s a bad thing It actually makes me slightly shudder to think that I used to eat here when I was too lazy to go elsewhere for Chinese food Unless you get something that has been very very fried you are out of luck The servers always seems overworked and rather miserable It wasn t a huge surprise when the staff filed a lawsuit against the whole Ollie s chain in 2007 for not paying adequate wages see http query nytimes com gst fullpage html res 9402E0DF1130F933A05750C0A9619C8B63 and http www columbiaspectator com 2009 03 23 owner ollie s tomo pays record sum labor dispute The Ollie s near Lincoln Center actually has decent food I have no idea what the hell is going on with this one 
-nsaYNjwVAbhh3dCZKoExg Columbia This is my favorite deli in Midtown They use quality Boarshead meat and give you A LOT more meat than any other deli around They re quick They are also cheaper than any other deli around for what you re getting The bread is fresh the lettuse is finely chopped What more do you want 
-nTzf51qPyrgGy1525CxTg Columbia I really enjoyed this place The food was great and the staff was pleasant I will be a repeat customer the problem with this place is the wait staff not very friendly at all but food is good if your looking for good food you will like it if your looking for good waiters go elsewhere 
-NVjaa9yHbXXFmf0CcjCHQ Columbia This place plays great music First it was the lulling voice of Enya humming softly in the background That was followed by a montage of Simon Garfunkel songs with some Beatles mixed in The music was played at just the right volume not so loud that it is intrusive but loud enough to be audible and appreciated Now the food the menu is a very simple one with no more than 10 15 items There is a prix fixe option for 25 appetizer main course and that s what I ended up getting As I am a seafood fiend I got the escargots for appetizer and shrimp saute as my entree Both were rather excellent and exotic Why 3 stars despite the wonderful music and good food I wasn t a fan of the physical setting The lack of air conditioning on an 85 degree day made the dining experience less than ideal The tables are small and low that combined with relatively high chairs makes it not so comfortable for tall people Also the portions are small and you should be prepared to eat a second dinner 
-OyprxGr7qzdMbAeVIzAJw Columbia Tasty veggies and salad A good place to eat healthy nice ambiance maybe not the most flavorful in the world though Sat outside which was lovely but our server was ambivalent 
-OYrGRFpX73W8a_0cqCEuw Columbia Pizza Place near Columbia Univ Take Number 1 to 110 its right in front of you when you leave the North exit of 110 street Uptown Regular cheese slice with no toping is like 2 75 used to be 50 cents once upon a time The only point worth mentioning is the size its larger than your HEAD The pizza used to be better but they put too little cheese and too little sauce basically its getting fucked up day by day well anyways worth an experience to eat a slice of cheese pizza thats bigger than your head 1 star for the ingenuity 
-P2wzb-MMEyEgwhLicJ0xg Columbia Doesn t have free Wifi Friendly staff and good espresso though 
-PfUlpAtmTp2sDlhU9Pyxg Columbia I tried to sweet talk the line cook into making me a giant roti it didn t work In spite of my failed efforts I am still a fan of this place It s a cheap tasty meal that you can get until the wee hours of the night The vege fillings are pre made they scoop it out in chunks onto the grill but it tastes wonderful reheated with fresh toppings of tomatoes onions and hot sauce The roti itself is heated over the grill with some oil giving the wrap a nice chewy texture The shrimp is one of my favorite non vege frankies since the fennel and white sauce really complement the shrimp well I ve also enjoyed their fried calamari several times While the overly spiced tentacles aren t actually crispy it s the right level of grease and flavor to cut through a night of heavy lifting drinking I wouldn t come here if you re actually looking for Indian cuisine just as I wouldn t order egg rolls if I wanted Chinese food Roti Roll is a breed of its own and a damn tasty one at that 
-ppOUGkyQcj6pJEr2wjLhw Columbia Guacamole is actually the main reason that I go to Chipotle Sue Y is incorrect the guacamole does not have sour cream in the recipe The recipe is available on Chipotle s website http www chipotle com html food aspx ingredients I gave Chipotle 5 stars at an Indiana location because it s all relative to what the options are in a specific region In New York City one can find many more interesting and delicious places to eat but Chipotle is very convenient for a quick bite of something real and fresh Anti hormone meats etc And a cute non obnoxiously corporate decor 
-PRYqSb9hqM_cxIiUHx9MA Columbia I m a little surprised by the 2 previous reviews I was actually very happy with both the service and the quality of the food I am extremely picky with miso soup and there is only one sushi restaurant that makes it just the way I like it I can now include Vine in that list My boyfriend and I both got the spicy tuna with avocado roll very tasty and my boyfriend got the peanut and avocado roll so good surprising blend but so good the shrimp tempura roll shrimp is his favorite and he loved it and california roll nothing special but still edible We both ordered the watermelon juice which we ve never had before they had a nice list of fresh fruit juices and I ve been dreaming of it since Our waitress was attentive a little hard to understand but attentive nonetheless The restaurant was completely filled and I noticed the guy sitting next to us hadn t had his order taken right away but with a different waitress Who cares though I was happy with my service My boy friend actually said that he felt the waiters were on you a little too much they were too quick One negative some of the tables were right on top of each other I literally sat next to people I didn t know like I was eating with them If in the area we would hit up this place again 
-PyGfsIL6BT25op4pDC6bA Columbia Not bad friendly waiter lots of room and a good vibe I liked the place Great selection of beers I tried a new one that I had never had before Son of a Peach and loved it 3 stars though for the food It wasn t too expensive it just wasn t all that The chicken wings were borderline gross Fleshy skin no crisp covered in sauce and just looked ghostly and helpless and they never gave us plates to put the bones on so they sat on napkins The bleu cheese dipping sauce tasted sugary and was thin and watery I will go to have beer but maybe save my meal for another place There is also a bathroom attendant in the coed bathrooms which was male when I went and I found it really interesting that this sports bar pub kind of a place would require a bathroom attendant I don t bring cash with me to the bathroom so I got the hairy eyeball from him for not leaving a dollar for him after he handed me a piece of paper towel Come on now 
-qe4f6vglozw_fI3SlEvMw Columbia I really like this place Compared to some korean restaurants that I ve been to in Koreatown in Manhattan this place is far superior My favorite is the seafood soon dubu so flavorful and contains lots of actual seafood The kimchi pork stir fried is also very good My friend ordered a shrimp fried rice once and it was apparently the best fried rice he has ever eaten Service is mediocre though and like most Korean restaurants I ve been to they ll serve you with the check if they see you re done eating even if you want to sit for a few more minutes and wait for all the yummy food to digest 
-qeZRhtcJLsz8w_n4erkpg Columbia It should basically be called Food for St Luke s employees convenience I can t imagine another reason to purchase food here besides working in the hospital and having a short break which only leaves you enough time to run across the street The food here is blatantly overpriced completely meh and the hotbar s menu hasn t changed in at least a year 
-qlORmmSrINunD2teXFRZg Columbia Great pizza Come here at least a couple of times a month Best pizza in the neighborhood 
-QN6WSe7I8dCXpddGIOBJg Columbia I agree everyone there is nothing fancy here just a pleasant neighborhood place My food was mediocre at best I will most likely never find my way back 
-qoYHN6eY7pe6yMvY1mPOw Columbia Bad food even for that price The only good thing about this place is how quick they make you food which is also a bad thing It is crowded with students all the time and the only reason for this is because it is so close to the law school and law school students are always at the law school Well I guess the other reason is that it is faster than Camille s Bottom line is that most of the food just tastes bad There are a couple of good sandwiches I get including the NYPD I think and the Cubano but I feel bad walking in here most of the time knowing that I have sold out on my taste buds Milano market is much better and located close by 
-r4VBTXPpXQnGdfeCgsrkw Columbia Hooray for Hooda Amidst a flotilla of food stands around the Columbia campus the line that forms here every day at lunch speaks for itself It s the better Halal cart of them all completely equivalent to Amir s http www yelp com biz amirs falafel new york in terms of consistent quality of output but cheaper so win win win 
-RD8b-O_qShbEHl7qccSxw Columbia I was visiting New York from out of down and getting lunch with a friend who works at Columbia She had an hour break and we wanted a place where we could eat and talk until she had to go back to work Tom s should have been our LAST choice We both ordered sandwiches just over Tom s 6 minimum and ate them fairly quickly but felt comfortable lounging around sipping our coffees because there were several empty tables in the restaurant and no line at the door At about the 45 minute mark our server comes over to us and says Are you going to let me earn a living We said What do you mean He told us to leave and let more customers use the table We pointed out that there were several empty tables His reply There weren t before Yes well we were eating before so of course he didn t tell us to get out then Perhaps seeing the problem with his argument he switched tracks telling us You guys barely ordered over the minimum anyway Look I ve been a waiter before so I m not the kind of person who picks fights or always complains about service This guy was just flat out rude I almost asked to speak to his manager but I m just not that confrontational The food by the way was pretty mediocre not worth enduring the waitstaff for I wouldn t go back even if I didn t live three states away 
-RlBGypuqjZw3G9d7yHoPQ Columbia Cooking with local ingredients does not mean great food all the times Brunch at Community Food Juice did not surprise me Blueberry pancakes are better at Kitchenette Uptown some blocks away However the Vietnamese chicken sandwich was really tasty 
-s4b57lFNK6S558etbd3Lw Columbia I m all for the local business in the neighborhood So I popped in to have a bite to eat I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and my friend ordered Chavignon Blanc We patiently waited to be served our drinks 20 minutes the drinks arrived Instead of Pinot Noir I swear it was Asti Spumante That was some straight bull crap in the glass I didn t drink it I asked to speak with the manager of course with out any luck Just a bunch of excuses So I m already over the entire place So I ordered dinner Salmon Bok Choy it was ok I m sorry CHOCOLATE you can t get anymore of my money RATCHET with the old dudes by the door ushering people out for a private party Nice space need NEW MANAGER one who actually not ducking from his patrons become better verse with your wine selection WE ALL DON T DRINK HENNEY 1 Star for DECOR 
-sR8Fow7NA_Q0mjFvkdcww Columbia Tons of MSG in the food even more than most Chinese take out places If you want to take an instant nap after eating order Panda I ordered the Garlic Shrimp combo that included shrimp pork fried rice and veggies They throw in those crunchy Chinese snacks and an eggroll I also got the won ton soup which was below average It came out to be 10 bucks Pretty quick and tasty stuff except it ll knock you out 
-SSCt0V84ukRcIaoR9-t8Q Columbia Found a speck of who knows what in my wine A bug A food particle from the person who last drank from that wine glass that the dish washer didn t properly clean Who knows Either way nasty Food is wholly mediocre to bad The only upside was the pleasant waitress 
-t-Vcpk9uhJFJtz6wxTH5g Columbia Ahhh memories of Columbia University toga parties with the rugby team Blackhaus nights Beer pong and the essential visit to Koronet Pizza at the end of the night The size is incredible it s the biggest slice I have ever seen in my life possibly equivalent to 2 3 normal slices But a slice was always SO perfect at least to me at 3am wrapped in a bedsheet fake ID in tow 
-tO3JRbjPpHM9uMJDGFFmQ Columbia This place is awesome Despite how I think that SoHa is one of the more ridiculous words to be used to describe a neighborhood the food here is great Prices are reasonable the pasta is fresh and sauce is great Wait time is not too bad either even though it tends to be busy all the time I don t mind the small space i think it just adds to the cozy atmosphere it seems to be going for My friend also managed to finagle a cup or something from one of the waiters which was nice My one gripe is that they only accept cash but that is not a huge deal 
-TTJYzLyrrtvHXwUGyzIgQ Columbia A late night staple for Columbia students Koronet uses all the gimmicks it can get for customers to enjoy its somewhat mediocre pizza The size of the pizza yes it is mind boggling can be daunting at first but it s not too hard to eat a slice or two if you ve got the appetite The only problem is whether or not you d want to The pizza tastes a bit like cardboard at times and doesn t have too much flavor For just a bit over 3 it s not a bad deal The place is open really late into the evening and is popular with students clearing out of the bars as it s one of the only places to eat nearby If there were other choices Koronet just might not be so special 
-Txik2wIEvKS1qI6wLMUUw Columbia I was really excited when this place opened up in my neighborhood but the time I went there was only so so The restaurant interior is cool and modern The pizza was a bit overpriced for the portions and the crust was bland The waiter went on and on about how thin it was and it was basically a cracker I ve had plenty of delicious thin pizza try Keste in the East Village but this doesn t qualify It was a bit disappointing 
-U1s44aBHbDYbOubZm1IZg Columbia OK my friends ADORE this place and it seems like a lot of people here love it here too but my first visit here was sooooooo average It s a really cute cozy place I was excited to decide on my dish I liked how it was a relatively small menu which usually implies more care and thought from the kitchen I finally decided on the fettucine with mushrooms in truffle oil after my friend raved about their homemade fettucine Well I was truly disappointed It was pretty much a bottomless bowl of mushrooms doused in oil with a side of fettucine After a few bites I thought to myself Wait really Am I eating a bowl of oily mushrooms I thought this was a pasta dish For 14 a big disappointment However my friends got spaghetti pomodoro 7 95 and truffled eggs 12 95 which were both SO much better Really great and flavorful So it looks like I ordered the wrong dish for my taste Hopefully I ll come back and next time I ll have something I like 
-u3J_-FzmlqDChpNXAMsuQ Columbia I feel bad writing a negative review for a small business but here it is I only got take out from Jesus Taco once I thought it was the worst Mexican food I ve ever had and my girlfriend thought it was the worst food she s ever had period It was cold where it should have been hot flavorless fell apart and overall disgusting All of their food and ingredients seemed lousy We ve both had Mexican from a lot of places including delivery and it was never like this I m not sure if we had bad luck and it just happened to be a bad night at the kitchen or if delivery food from them is always worse than eat in or what might have happened but our delivery that night was awful I hope for their sake that Jesus Taco either improves their food or that our experience was a fluke But I would never get food from there again If you re close enough a Mexican restaurant nearby I would recommend is Taqueria y Fonda which is almost always perfect and has never been disgusting like Jesus Taco They deliver too 
-u7sgGhI7Vwx24wDRin0Ig Columbia Fun place in the summer when they have the doors open but it s just too noisy otherwise They ve got to do something about the acoustics Great food and beers though and a nice change of scenery in the neighborhood 
-U7wJXw6LLOHYDV6SRTg1w Columbia Everything is authentic here and most of everything is amazing The chicken is perfect moist succulent and well but not over seasoned The flan is the best I have ever had The only drawback is that some items apparently are not homemade like the fried cod which with sometimes has an ice cube inside Still this is much better than the local El Malecon and arguably better than the Bronx location 
-u9dGNThIl8pDY5pOjnKkQ Columbia Oh no did the quality food fall off to match the attitude of the hostesses yes I walked here for brunch last Saturday with my bf and we both ordered the Eggs Benedict and I was not impressed This is the same meal that I have every time I come for brunch but what happened did the chef have a bad day 
-uh1CW814z42GiqyntTNvw Columbia Mediocre pan Asian food They ve also screwed up delivery orders The only reason I go there at all and gave them two stars is because they do decent bubble tea and carry Lady M s crepe cake Otherwise I wouldn t set foot in the place 
-Ui8LDJvluiGssxTzzimjA Columbia I don t know why JJ dining hall got such negative reviews Their food was more than edible Yes it s not as good as say Cornell dining hall but it gets us through just fine The brunch was pretty good There s a variety of waffles cereals salad bar fruits drinks etc I loved the chocolate soy milk But I guess it s too pricey for their quality Was it 14 without meal plans I will also complain about the to go sandwich box it was horribleeee Cheap cold sandwich with a bag of chips and cookies for 14 dollars Anyway overall it is an acceptable dining hall 
-UUCigObd8qrD3SmrfkeTQ Columbia The lamb is delicious here The portions might seem small but then you just keep eating and eating the injera fills you up quickly Try a glass of honey wine The honey tastes very subtle but it s perfect Also the kategna appetizer was delicious Basically it s toasted fried injera with spices A bit greasy but it will wake up your taste buds This places gets super crowded so try to call ahead for reservations My only complaint is that I wish their spicy dishes would be even spicier 
-V3Rm0bcbpt1Ikh0SOz_DQ Columbia Strangely whenever I visit friends who study at Columbia I have lunch with them at Vine Although Vine s food is average in general it grills eggplant well I also likes its papaya smoothie If you want a quick lunch at Morning Heights Vine would be a decent choice Food 2 Decor 2 Service 3 
-V9C28pJU9Xw4Sk5ikbozA Columbia I ve been to Chocolat many times and had great experiences but this last time makes me question whether I will return again I m a busy mom of two so it s been a couple weeks since my experience but I really need the owner managers to know that what I experienced is not acceptable I went there for lunch on a TUESDAY a couple weeks ago with a girlfriend I had my twins in tow and she had her son with her All three children a under a year old so they are definitely NOT partaking in the food at this restaurant Despite this when we received our bill we were shocked to discover that gratuity had already been included b c we were a large party Seriously We sat at a table for two and had our strollers on either side of the table and the infants did not have anything to eat so why we re we charged the automatic gratuity My friend and I couldn t help but chuckle b c the18 they charged was less than our standard 20 tip but the gall of them to charge two women a group rate makes me question returning any time soon 
-vOD3m5z07zY8zCxncYyKA Columbia It is hard to imagine a more mediocre American diner The food is very unremarkable I ve had a few different dishes always rather greasy and bland It seems they do not need to make an extra effort to make great food because there is a constant flow of Seinfeld tourists regardless of the quality of food One thing that really puts me off this diner is the insistence with which they try to push you out of the restaurant as soon as you re finished eating I was calmly drinking coffee with my friend for 5 minutes after the meal and they asked us to please leave because other people werw waiting I found that really rude However the prices are pretty good especially for the Columbia area 
-vpduOM_NK5AfTW0l-ySZQ Columbia Mediocre sushi at its best I think it s pretty good for the price but I don t really get much pleasure out of eating mediocre sushi If you re going to eat sushi eat good sushi If not order a pizza The vegetable tempura is delicious The spicy roll combo was disappointing It wasn t gross the way bad sushi can be but it was warm and the fish tasted a little tiny bit less than fresh You re not going to get sick from this place but it s also not much better than what you get at Westside Market or Whole Foods 
-VtAo2xJ0hGTac7DJFvaTQ Columbia Just moved to the neighborhood and ate here for the first time I was excited by the brunch menu and the atmosphere was cozy upon arrival They were prompt to bring our coffee and water and were easy going about substituting fruit for salad potatoes My date and I were in no hurry so we didn t inquire when 20 minutes had passed without any sign of our meals We ordered a crepe with cheese avocado and bacon and a french toast plate with 2 eggs and sausage Another 20 minutes went by with no food but plenty of coffee refills We finally got our food and it was relatively well prepared although the ingredients weren t very evenly dispersed throughout the crepe wads of cheese and gobs of avocado facing off across a mountain range of chopped bacon About 1 4 way through our meal a woman stood up and inquired loudly across the counter about why she had been waiting 45 minutes for her breakfast food The owner manager was quick to respond and here s where things got interesting He checked the woman s order ticket and corrected her she had only been waiting 41 minutes and her food was now ready She explained that she had eaten there before and experienced a similar unreasonable wait although that was due to her order ticket falling from the queue and being forgotten The cook interjected to say that he remembered the ticket falling incident and that they compensated the customer with free dessert The customer retorted that she had paid for her dessert at her last visit and was simply inquiring as to the delay a question we had seriously considered asking after 40 minutes The owner began raising his voice to the customer and trying to convince her that the wait was perfectly reasonable as they were busy all the tables were indeed full and there were about 20 customers She said that he was being rude and his customer service technique was good ol reliable rubber and glue the customer was being rude by asking She pointed out that 2 gentlemen who had arrived after her were already eating The quick witted cook leapt to the rescue by asking the customer in a classically condescending fashion how many people are in their party 2 how many people are in your party 3 The owner took that opportunity to remind the young woman that he had been the owner manager for 7 years and he knew what he was doing At this point our meal was essentially ruined and I was reminded of eating dinner at a table while my parents argued over nothing A simply apology by the owner would ve really smoothed things over but he couldn t bring himself to it The young woman and her two friends decided that they were ready to leave and began packing up She proceeded to offer to pay and the big shot owner said no no of course not Wait until your food is ready and then walk out he chided She informed him that she frequented the place but would not be back and the owner projecting his voice across the restaurant said that he didn t need her business and offered her the meal to go in a desperate sarcastic fashion The young woman declined and went over to her waitress at the register she had previously said that the specific waitress was a friend of hers The young woman quietly tipped her waitress friend and started to say that she was sorry but she wouldn t be returning after how she was treated by the owner Meanwhile the owner 4 feet away began trying to INTIMIDATE the customer asking why she was talking to the waitress when he was right there for her to talk to the woman s 2 friends a couple with their baby had already walked out to wait outside He came over behind the waitress and loomed over the counter She said that she was done talking to him and was saying goodbye to her friend and he accused her of trying to talk about him while he was right there She got fed up and just turned and walked out Every patron at every table watched on in agony as the owner demonstrated just how tactless he could be while setting a sterling example of a failure in customer service ungracious unwilling to listen and generally agitated The waiters and busboys looked on in agony as if this wasn t the first time the owner had virtually engaged in an altercation with the customer I considered telling him that I couldn t enjoy my meal in the wake of the argument which took a bare minimum of 5 minutes to play out but I wasn t in the mood to test this guy as he had gotten pretty huffy and for all I know was ready to snap We paid and tipped our waiter but I can t be emphatic enough in this rambling review I know I m griping that you should not give this guy your business Atrocious morning and I m still in a bad mood 4 hours later I thank anyone who read through all that My summary The food is fine the menu is fine the waitstaff is pleasant and the atmosphere is fine as long as the owner keeps his mouth shut He doesn t care about your business Stay away 
-W5lo9Y2JmWBCzwsL4lCuA Columbia Chocolat is in soft launch which means full menu but no alcohol They won t even let you bring a bottle of wine like Frizzante did when they opened but say that their license is only a few weeks away That being said the food was pretty good I particularly enjoyed the sesame calamari which was actually large enough to be an entree The house salad was good and large but nothing you couldn t do at home with a bag of mixed greens The flat iron steak special was well prepared and accompanied by potato puree and asparagus The the snapper however while incredibly tasty was overcooked I will go back when I can pair a drink with my meal but probably not often as the prices are steep compared to the other excellent restaurants in the area 
-Watxu-JkajaWzyo24BzBg Columbia Oxtail delish shrimp mofongo pure perfection and mojitos are one of the best one in the city Brunch menu is well put together aND staff is super attemptive 
-Wc9iEPNBF-N7M0kwDXmrw Columbia Ok first off seriously nobody calls it the hamdel I have been coming here for over 5 years since I have to work in the area The sandwiches are ok The drink prices are a bit extreme and the selection could be better The best thing about this place is the burgers Oh my God are they even real They are so good The people that work here are very friendly and they do a good job of getting your order out to you quickly Generally a good place to stop anytime when you get the munchies 
-WeZzw4kkgE-lx9D0lJrNA Columbia Don t go if you are hungry I have been to the Harlem Tavern 4x yes that many and with the exception of 1 visit it was quite bad I went to Harlem Tavern for brunch 1x and for dinner 3x My three bad visits were all to blame on the lackluster service and food I had to wait for water 10mins and my drinks to arrive 25 mins the part that is annoying is that it appears to me that the bartenders are not that busy On one occasion after being seated for 45 minutes the waitress had my appetizer and main course come out together sigh Another time after 25 minutes of waiting seated my waiter forgot to actually place our order my drinks appetizer and main dish He then asked us to repeat everything we ordered AGAIN because he forgot The table next to mine was a family where the parents received their entree ate it but their children s dishes didn t arrive until the parents were done Here are some notes about HT Atmosphere Great location with ample seating for all couples large groups and families with young children The entire restaurant has flat screen tv s throughout and on occasion a live dj and a jazz band pretty cool Food Awesome beer selection if that s your thing The other drinks are so so I ve ordered the Amish chicken dish which is great but I wish there was consistency sometimes the creamy polenta is not so creamy The lamb burger was excellent at brunch but at dinner the following times it was eh Don t get the french onion soup I think they make it with beer it was pretty bad so bad it had to be returned Dessert menu is basically nonexistent which is bad for a dessert gal like me I usually just take a little stroll to Make My Cake for a cupcake Service The staff is obviously inexperienced They all need training in how to 1 remember an order ie writing it down on a piece of paper vs trying to remember 2 Placing the order into the system correctly 3 Spacing the order so that my appetizer doesn t come out with my entree mmmkkk Location Perfect location and is easily accessible by car and train I ve tried to call management but they never called me back I guess you can say that s typical So you may ask why do I keep going back if its so bad Because the food is not that bad and I actually have low expectations for bar food seating is always available without a reservation or wait its so easy to get to and the atmosphere I m not sure how long that will last though I hope this review helps you 
-wyOUn-JDMxhe7f6x9Cm9Q Columbia Great place to nibble ON FOOD and lounge Very relaxing and romantic Kick back and crowded couches 
-x9UUZd_kz5bEyr6_8ro2w Columbia Yummy and healthy Great biscuits strong coffee A bit loud in main room cafeteria style but there s a small back room that is better for conversation I had eggs with this chicken apple sausage it was pretty tasty Its crowded seemingly all of the time as there is the Columbia Upper West crowd Organic fresh ingredients make me want to go back Service was pretty good 
-XC7yODKMJfn91MaP-gUuQ Columbia Not worth the price at all The cupcakes are generic and the cookies are stale 
-xMICid1DOUk_O5cmNrgIg Columbia You re here either because you want to be in Max SoHa and they don t have room for you so you re waiting for a table and dreaming of gnocchi or you re here because there is a gee dee dearth of comfortable coffee shops on Amsterdam Ave which is ridonks consids how many fricking people there are nearby who just want a place to put a book out and write in it or on it or about it Anyway that s why you re here If you do buy something like say a salad it has like four bits of lettuce and it costs 8 If you buy a crostini or a panini or a ini it s cheaper and tastier If you buy coffee you re not me because I don t buy coffee And at least there are lots of different chairs and things and mostly you can sit there for hour nursing your 8 three pieces of lettuce and ignoring the staff well actually they took to ignoring you first You could do better but not a whole lot better I mean at least you re not at Fresh 
-xNGgMHMc5rrmsyiT3nnyA Columbia This was awful I hated every minute of my experience there I had egg drop soup Funny thing is they forgot the flavor I also shared an order of pan fried pork dumplings I d say they forgot the flavor on this too except the parts of the wonton which they burnt definitely had some unpleasant flavor For an entree I had some noodles a wide noodle sauteed with some beef They were greasy and lacked any seasoning I should have sent everything back and left but I was hungry and it was late at night This place is always packed and so I thought it would be good Now I just want to know why the hell so many people are there all the time Surely they aren t there for the food 
-xWW0iZoHo7Vs0f39NO_8g Columbia My friend is a Seinfeld fan and so the opportunity to eat at the diner that served as the outside for Monk s on Seinfeld felt like a nice treat We walked in and were seated I had a regular breakfast of eggs sausage and toast My friend had a bagel with lox There are also photos of the Seinfeld cast up on the walls So what did I think It s just standard fare diner nothing that really stood out The main draw for this place is that it has a link to Seinfeld so people will come just to check it out Wait staff is decent Of course the younger gals are more engaging but that s about it It s close to Columbia University so you can always stroll over there afterwards Other than that nothing too special about this place 
-xxJRyBMJCygtCMuVfhmEA Columbia We ordered a large pizza at 6 30pm Granted it was during the Super Bowl and the person we spoke with over the phone we couldn t access the site presumably due to the increased traffic told us it could take up to 1 5 hrs We started calling again around 9pm We either got a busy signal or no one picked up Finally we were able to reach someone around 10 30pm a full 4 hours after our order They told us the pizza had not yet been made I understand that demand must be crazy during the Super Bowl But it s also not a surprise In my opinion they should have 1 Gauged the number of orders and not taken our order 2 If they only realized after our order was placed that they wouldn t be able to deliver on it to call We had an email confirmation as well as a phone confirmation and of course thought it was coming 3 At least issued us an apology when we called at 10 30pm and the pizza had not even been made At the very least there is a serious logistical problem combined with sub par customer service There are many other options in the neighborhood so this is likely the last time we ll order from them 
-YF9X-9Cc0zAb1yWcL1flA Columbia Mill Korean has something for everyone Carnivores vegetarians vegans and people like me who just eat fish and vegetables Also its atmosphere is informal and comfortable Mill Korean serves you lots of small appetizer vegetable dishes hotly spiced with more nuances than just kimchi I highly recommend the oe bi bim bap even if I may be spelling it wrong It s raw fish with an abundance of vegetables and rice I ve also gone there with people who love beef and all of them have loved the multiple options for beef at this restaurant the beef being cooked in a Korean style As a plus they are not hesitant to make your dish vegetarian or vegan if you ask I really recommend this place 
-Yh6fdRVRz3K4lbSh09uJg Columbia Probably the best Mexican in the area those so called authentic ones don t seem too authentic who puts mozzarella cheese in a taco Anyhoo I like the Havanna Chicken Burrito and Quesadilla Those Bulldogs Margarita and Corona in one are good but they ll get you in trouble and maybe a headache careful 
-yMH-o7UnnUTYpY01DvNkQ Columbia Hole in the wall Mexican tacos and burritos The closest you can get to decent Southern Californian Mexican food in Manhattan 
-z8K96EXKFn5_fly8hOdVg Columbia I love this place It s amazing to have that kind of outdoor space in the neighborhood and the food is really tasty Sure nothing on the menu is especially fancy but they get the basics right and it s reasonably priced I had the sausage plate which was really delicious I was a little annoyed at how long it took for the food to arrive but our waiter Christian he s fabulous was attentive and entertaining throughout The beer list could be better for a place that bills itself as a tavern but it s certainly a wider selection than anywhere else in the neighborhood although Bier probably has a smaller higher quality selection I will definitely be there again and again 
-zFreEYso8KVCHbcIg7QDg Columbia I really tried to look past the negative reviews and try this place out anyway The service was very spotty My group and I ordered drinks and the drinks sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes before the waiter decided to bring the drinks over The waiters were more concerned with make convo among themselves than attending to the patrons I ordered the crab and lobster dish and disliked greatly I had the waiter take it back and went with the burger and fries instead and that was OK i could have made abbter one at home smh The fries were actually good I really liked the ambiance there very mellow and nice decor I would go back but only for drinks no dinner Sorry Chocolat you dont get my vote 
-_c5ZMUpqzvmMlwVbETIwQ Columbia I went to SubsConscious a couple of times before I found out about Appletree I think it s a little overpriced and I feel kind of stressed out by the people that work there because the cashier usually has a little tude 
-_CsSscKsSrTWqCk7b7Bwg Columbia I love everything about Sezz Medi from their bread to their brick oven pizza Although it is a bit of a tease when I m starving and staring at them cooking pizza in the oven Anyway my friend and I shared a 20 pizza and we struggled to finish it so the bill ended up being around 10 dollars the pizza we had Ripieno stuffed Ricotta Mozzarella Spicy Salami Basil Tomato Mushroom was more of a fancy calzone than an actual pizza The dough was outside and it was stuffed with everything else inside So good Even the crust was delicious Nothing was overwhelming My only complaint is that the pizza options with meat were somewhat minimal and I m a total meathead That might not be the correct term 
-_IxBhT-35dPc2MUTLJkMg Columbia Those who know me well know that I when I have a crazy idea it must come to completion If I come up with something exiting I must do it or else I ll fixate all week Yes I am aware that I am bat shit crazy Let it be known to Yelpers that I have the healthy kidney 10K and the Brooklyn half coming up so every weekend I do one slower endurance run between 8 13 miles Usually I will do this run with Rita E She helps keep me motivated and we always have fun laughing and gabbing the whole way She is on vacation for 2 5 weeks so my motivation has dropped considerably Why run when you have nice herbal therapy at home and cold gluten free beer in the fridge So basically until Rita gets home i have to come up with my own motivation to run I calculated that running from my apartment in Brooklyn to Harlem would be about 11 miles and what better excuse to gorge myself on chicken and waffles If I am going to cheat on gluten I better go out hard So thus going back to the idea on fixation I had the idea the whole last week that I would run to Harlem to eat soul food I remembered seeing the Throwdown w Bobby Flay episode where he gets spanked in the chicken and waffles competition by a little place by the name of Melba s Melba s would be a 10 5 mile run away which was perfect for my long run I told Josh H that if he met me I would pay for his dinner He obliged and thus our visit I arrived in the restaurant a sweaty mess I profusely apologized for my disheveled appearance The woman at the bar was Melba herself and she told me not to worry at all I explained that I ran from Brooklyn and she promptly sat me down at the bar and poured me a much needed glass of water She was engaging and so sweet She even let me sit at a table while I waited for Josh A waiter promptly came over and told me that he heard I ran there We chatted about running for a while and he told me that Melba the owner was so impressed that they wanted to give me a free drink on the house Talk about awesome service I ordered a delicious Pinot Noir Josh came soon after and we both had fried chicken on the brain He got the combo plate and ordered mac and cheese and collards as his sides I went with the fried chicken and eggnog waffles with a side order of sauteed spinach to keep the semblance of healthy living We LOVED the food Like fuck me I want to marry you loved the food The eggnog waffle was one of the best things I have ever eaten and was well worth the gluten hangover This was one of the best ideas I have come up with in a while Service was prompt and so nice Josh and I wound up tipping 30 percent just because we felt so welcome Why not 5 stars Josh and I kept on waking up in the middle of the night to drink water Methinks that the brine they used on the chicken was so salty that we became dehydrated The food didn t taste salty but often times you find that extra sodium creeping up on you in the brine I don t mind extra Na Cl but not when I need to drink numerous cups of water in the middle of the night to maintain homeostasis Despite this we had an amazing dining experience and I would happily return 
0-cvBjERazfUo54740BAPQ Columbia This place was AWFUL I went with a group of friends after visiting Columbia The food was crappy psuedo traditional Chinese and the service was horrendous I had the wonton soup noodles with roasted pork The broth was both extremely bland and very greasy The wontons and the roast pork were pretty flavorless The actual waiter who served us was very nice until it came time to pay the bill He very nicely told us that they couldn t split the check We were trying to figure out how to divide the bill when a female staff member maybe a manager came over and started waving the bill in our faces and yelling at us about how we couldn t split the bill I ended up putting it all on my card After we purposely left a shitty tip she actually followed us out of the restaurant onto Broadway and demanded an explanation We told her we didn t tip servers who were as unpleasant and mean as she had been She started yelling at us again and told us not to ever come back Terrible terrible experience Expensive sub par food insane staff I ll stick to Chinatown for good noodles 
0-oK0qelwpdwdb9-71PHow Columbia Did the waffle propose to the chicken or vice versa Do you suppose the food priest said the following Chicken do you take waffle to be your plate partner until teeth do you part Both chicken and waffle agree Strawberry butter is exchanged I now pronounce you a delicious food pairing you may now be drenched in syrup This was my first ever chicken and waffles experience and it really gets about 3 4 stars Both chicken and waffle but both just seemed to have been a bit on the drier side That strawberry butter was something else tasting freshly of strawberries more so than butter I actually liked taking bites of just the waffle with that and syrup and bites of just the fried chicken and hot sauce sorry it s the Korean in me I went with a group of five on Saturday at about 12 40ish and we were happy to have no wait The waiter did get upset with us since we paid with 4 cards I was a server once it really is annoying I know this beat Bobby Flay in Throwdown but I m convinced there may be better chicken and waffle marriages elsewhere Got suggestions Send them 
00FGaERZweaVngOE7DcEUQ Columbia Arguably the best pizza in New York City Nothing fancy at all about it in fact it s pretty cheap Way cheaper than other shops in the Columbia MSM JTS area Perhaps it s a bit of a hike for your average student but they deliver pretty far and there are no better pizza options in the area 
00SxM3WfNTurq8zux1u2Iw Columbia A healthy layer of melted cheese can correct a lot of culinary faults but not at Jesus Taco There s something distgusting about the sauces they use that no amount of cheese can cover up The staff are pretty clueless they got our order wrong but gladly corrected it adding some extra cheese for good measure The price is right but the food is nasty it probably explains why Jesus Taco is a perrenial favorite of the neighborhood stoners 
00VlVgGDScXwijRzFvvV8Q Columbia Beautiful atmosphere when I walked in Friendly staff great service and the brunch was excellent Will definitely become my new regular brunch spot If you are thinking about going here don t think just do it You won t regret 
01kdu-jwm1M0b4IvmJ_tKg Columbia By no means do I qualify myself as a Thai expert but this place has a great atmosphere with quality food and pricing comparable to other Thai places in the neighborhood Service was a little slow but since we went at the peak of the dinner hour on a Friday night that was probably why I ll be adding this to my places to eat when we have out of town company over 
01RZS5ddVgNq_LIXODyNQA Columbia I have come to this place several times I must share with you the plain crepe with sugar butter is out of this world deliciously simply phenomenal please try it and tell me what you think However I had to deduct a star for service which is slow and absent minded Also for the one time I came here and they were short staffed and ran out of eggs That was just strange but they assured that was only a one time occurrence due to the holiday I hope they learn to run across the street for more eggs if that ever happens again duh But it s all worth it for that plain crepe Mmmm 
01SnyKH8R9YVjQvx5HYHYA Columbia i just moved to harlem and have a good feeling that i ll be frequenting this relatively new addition to the neighborhood the vibe is a bit more packed noisy than i usually enjoy but the music is great and the crowd is extremely friendly my brother and i spent a good half hour talking to the guy next to us about technology and dealing with his rebellious teenage daughter it should be noted that neither of us have kids which we readily volunteered at the start of the conversation before he began seeking advice the menu is pretty diverse and delicious every time i ve gone i ve had a very hard time settling on what to order the trio of sausages starter is obviously a must but from there it becomes much trickier i ve had a couple of their burgers and a pulled pork sandwich that i can honestly say is much better than its more famous neighbor 9 blocks to the north and a couple blocks west excited to try the flatbreads but now that i ve had the pulled pork i may never stray from that beer selection is pretty solid although not breathtaking and this is probably my only beef with the place heavy on IPAs and hefeweizens not so heavy on porters stouts or lagers that said i can definitely live with the options and they ve got a fairly solid bourbon selection which helps to compensate 
02ji5sevxe86Ay9JN5sB1A Columbia Mmmmmm brunch I should start off by saying that this is only for brunch However it was so good that we went Saturday and Sunday morning the first weekend I tried Campo I may need to frequently pause during this review to wipe up my drool Day 1 we did all breakfast selections and day 2 we ordered just about everything The goat cheese omelet is phenomenal the breakfast risotto should not be missed and the french toast was worth the walk in the pouring rain Yes I eat off my friend s plates so please one go out to dinner with me if you like to share Day 2 we got LOADS of the truffle fries two of the pizzas a burger some breakfast foods and calamari Our crowd grew on day 2 but we could have finished all that with a day 1 crowd It was all SO GOOD There is nothing I can t recommend I ve purposely been holding out on the best part UNLIMITED BLOODY MARYS OR MIMOSAS FOR 10 New Yorkers are damn spoiled Being from the land of one price drinks damn you Boston this was a HUGE treat for me My 1pm buzz and the people I entertained in Central Park afterward most certainly appreciated it Alright I m going to need to go back to New York ASAP 
03DJ2AO6G_KGdZZTxn4c0w Columbia Got the lumberjack with scrambled eggs and blueberry pancakes Good food and big portions The burger I got via delivery was not so good though It can be really hard to find a table on the weekend because it gets quite Crowded The atmosphere is family friendly and a typical dinner like decur 
03tesrfRR3iAfCMUST8EJA Columbia First a word about some of the negative reviews on this place posted by the ignorant Its obvious reading some of the comments that many of the detractors of this place have never had authentic Italian style pizza in their lives So if you ARE a fan of authentic Italian style pizza where the quality and simplicity of the ingredients are allowed to sing then you ll love Bettolona s pizza because its very good If however you are a fan of quantity over quality and prefer 12 toppings and fake mozzarella then stick with Papa John s and don t bother I have yet to dine in the restaurant itself though the pictures look nice so I cannot comment on the staff service or ambiance but we ve ordered from them half a dozen times now and the food has been excellent The pizza is really good the pasta is really good and the salads are good too I ve tried half the menu now and been quite impressed its not flashy its not trying to be anything avant garde its just simple delicious classic Italian recipes that are well executed and consistent The only thing I would caution with delivery is that if you order on a weekend they ll get busy and your food may arrive lukewarm So for delivery order on a weeknight for the best quality and fast delivery 
03t_4FU1Fl6bjBjh7ND0-w Columbia What a great addition to Harlem Friendly and casual atmosphere Wonderfully tasteful pizzas and a price that s not too bad It s my new go to for pizza in the SoHa 
03xaK0tjVEdpb_fni1WSOw Columbia Food overall is delicious Service depends on the day and time of day that you come Weekday brunch I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries Delicious Waitress was really friendly and available Saturday Brunch before 12 Busy as ever slower service but to be fair they only had 1 waitress serving I had the Eggs Florentine delicious Portions are great Coffee was great Saturday Brunch after 12 Not as busy therefore waitresses were a lot more available Had the friendliest hostess waitresses ever I had the Three Egg Omelette with choice of 2 fillings Delicious The bits of bacon were huge two thumbs up Would have preferred more home fries Side Note They were more than accommodating My friend asked for hot chocolate which they didn t have but the waitress was nice enough to whip something else up instead 
03XrKGsXhL14P2OBzJ6AEg Columbia Crepes on columbus is overpriced and there is always a wait However I consistantly return for their Oeuf Columbus On wonderfully cooked ratatoille they place a potato and goat cheese cake a thick latke and two poached eggs The cake is to die for Not being much of a fan of poached eggs I always ask for two cakes and they happily oblige I always wished the ratatoille be on a crepe but that may be carbo overload for even me They also have build your own crepe options and non crepe items Everything is normal sized portions it can get you full and are well made Nothing mind blowing in my opinion besides the aforementioned Oeuf Columbus However if you even have a small party expect to wait on the weekend There is a quick turn around but also a long line With free wifi a TV and a nice wait staff a less busy weekday would be the perfect study work location too bad everyone doesnt have the schedule of a student 
04UZvgIavrLAKKpyBD8YwQ Columbia This place is all around good but nothing more than that The coffee was good and my croissant sandwich with cheddar bacon and scrambled egg was also good The service seemed a little burnt out on the job and just wasn t very friendly The young woman working the counter just seemed like the last thing she wanted to be doing was working there understandable in the service industry on a Sunday She definitely let it show though by making me feel like every question I had was taxing on her and I didn t see her even give a fake smile the entire time I was there The food was good the service was O K and I liked the ambiance but it was definitely a crowded area with one too many tables for the size of the seating area Overall I would go back there if I was close and wanted some coffee and breakfast but other than that I wouldn t go out of my way to go back here I also would not go there with a group of more than 3 people considering they only had one cook and 2 people working the counter one primarily making espresso drinks when they get hit with a rush things are gonna take a while to come out 
04_x9tDrQzYGjQ7MctajeA Columbia Wow I love my soon to be neighborhood Everything about it has really impressed me thusfar and Melba s is no exception What a BEAUTIFUL restaurant As I was sitting there amongst fellow yelpers I took a moment to envision me and all my friends dining and laughing and enjoying good food and good company I had already eaten across the street but I browsed the dessert menu and went for my first slice of Red Velvet Cake It was indeed red It was certainly velvety And quite rich A little sweeter than what I desired but all the same quite enjoyable I was sitting next to Hugo O And when his Po Boy Sandwich came he offered me some fries I wasn t going to take one and then he gently insisted And Well THOSE ARE SOME GOOD FRIES Golden brown crispy seasoned to perfection with a little kick at the end Mmmm The wait staff was slow with getting our order and slow with bringing the check Guess they wanted us to stay a bit longer Southern hospitality I suppose Surprisingly reasonable for the atmosphere as far as prices are concerned And the background music was really good I can t wait to go back 
05RCUM4rUFZ3byLavRWAPw Columbia My wife and I are new to the neighborhood and I have been here several times for brunch lunch and dinner once The service is excellent the wine selection is solid and the food is very good I think the price point is more than appropriate It is low mid range to affordable for NY and I have certainly been to quite a few places in NY where the food was more expensive and not as good Yes maybe it is a bit higher than the average food option for the area but get used to it this strip of Harlem is becoming quite the hot spot and higher prices relative to what the area used to be tend to come along with that just look at the real estate It s usually crowded I m a fan and I can t wait until they get outdoor seating 
066mfcVrwb8Hr05baw-uDw Columbia only had wine here there were no seats left at the bar and all the lounge seating area was taken so we stood and had wine the vibe is really cool here love to see black people just hanging and chilling out and having discussions with friends and just having a good time the food looked awesome here and smelled great i will try it next time its small but i did not feel crowded just a really cool spot and i would definitely come back 
06c656okq23R-wf8F_S9ug Columbia Wonderful cozy restaurant The owner is awesome and friendly and pretty much does everything himself alongside a few waiters waitresses The service is slow but by that I mean he actually takes the time to cook it and prepare it like good food is supposed to be cooked and prepared My meal was delicious I had the special which from my memory was some sort of chicken unfortunately I can t quite remember exactly what it was Regardless it was delicious The whole place is an excellent spot for somebody looking to spend a relaxing few hours with friends or a significant other while enjoying awesome food We ordered a dessert which was plums with yogurt and it was amazing He brought out another dessert on the house which was peaches and cream Again amazing I highly recommend La Belle I will definitely be going back 
06vinJvVITtV42SNafyDEw Columbia This place is ok yes everything is super fresh but it s always crowded and over priced and the menu isn t that diverse 
07-kizxlPgbkxKP5WV5N9w Columbia I had high hopes for Pisticci and their version of orechiette broccoli rabe sausage but the pasta was overcooked For a small intimate Italian restaurant you d think they would have pasta down to a science but a perusal of yelp reviews seems to indicate otherwise R had high hopes for her grilled shrimp salad special as well another Italian restaurant standard but it was underdressed and there was more red onion than all the greenery combined We had reasonable expectations given their four star yelp rating and we were let down 
07OcBvs-Vli0DYGO0oA8kw Columbia CASH ONLY what it s really too loud in there there s absolutely nothing to absorb the sound also writing beer on the wall in different languages meh i could see where the paint ran which resembled bloody feces maybe that s more of a personal problem the beer list is not large enough for myself and its overwhelmingly more german than anything else i hear the neighborhood s lacking in a lot of nice hangouts so i m sure this is welcome but they need to try harder our server was pretty swell 
08lKHQRX0qEb5jukQ18Diw Columbia I really enjoyed Vine I went to try it last night for the first time since it changed from Swish or whatever it was called The boyfriend and I had a lovely time at Vine The ambiance was calm and the music wasn t too loud The sushi was really quite wonderful too We tried three house special rolls after having the miso soup and some pork gyoza The miso was pleasantly miso y The pork gyoza could have used a little more zing but they were good And the sushi was yummy The spicy tuna had a kick without being too spicy or too rich with mayo The tempura shrimp in one of the rolls was still crispy and well cooked I don t do sake but it looked like a good selection We had a really nice experience Will definitely go back before I move 
08_lw94785UN7FBuEZ2g0w Columbia The Take out Yes here on Yelp is inaccurate even during Snack hour and a half during said snack hour and early brunch CU students get 10 off with ID they scrutinized mine like a reverse bouncer Sat at the bar on the unwieldy stools which were uncomfortable but nice folks The farmer s chop was nothing special but did boast fresh ingredients and a hearty crunch Everything was saturated in dressing which overwhelmed the dish a bit but a solid albeit 10 purchase PS Clinton St Baking Co folks run the jizzy joint 
09jAs6yha5B8Cvy6lXz60Q Columbia I m really surprised by such bad reviews for Indian Cafe My friend and I order delivery every week or two weeks and I think it s delicious Maybe dining halls have lowered the standards of our taste palettes but I think their chicken saag is really quite yummy It s always usually cooked perfectly so it s never dry and always juicy and plump My friend gets either the chicken tikka masala or the chicken vindaloo The vindaloo is way too spicy for me but the tikka masala is pretty good Their naan is also good warm and soft even for delivery They only give us one carton of rice though which is enough for us but it doesn t seem like very much for two orders The one time we went there and ate the atmosphere was very nice and the service was good We got one of their specials some mango chicken curry and it was to die for Every time we call to order now we ask to see if they have it no luck yet though 
09mVzRdKOqJctovpn6dLWg Columbia There are too many bad things I can say about this place I ve never had Korean BBQ before and this was a great first experience We came here based on the recommendations of two people we randomly met Ordered the BBQ platter with chicken short ribs beef and pork Everything was great The beef was better than 99 of the restaurants I ve eaten at at this caliber Pork was flavorful and chicken was spicy but not too spicy Shared a premium 10 bottle of sake with my wife We couldn t finish all of the food so it was definitely great quality and quantity for the 60 we spent The spots in K town have a high bar to reach now that I ve experienced this little nugget in the UWS Short of 5 stars because the menus weren t clean and had food in them 
09qdTBdbbtN0q26LW8REkg Columbia Yes this is yet ANOTHER review about pancakes Came here because I had a strong craving and this place is very reasonably priced I got the strawberry pancakes and although they were super fluffy and very tasty the server was in a huge rush and messed up my order quite a bit First the pancakes came without the strawberries so he took my pancakes away and brought them back with four strawberries on top Then he completely forgot to bring the sausage side order I asked for He was very apologetic which I appreciated but when a woman s got a craving for pancakes and sausage there is very little room for mistakes The coffee was also not up to my diner standards Over all though a very good place to come for breakfast when you re on a budget and have been watching Seinfeld for the past two weeks 
0bdpY9ZLKyEQUr8jqQ7btg Columbia I ve ordered take out several times and the girl sitting behind the cash register is rude unfriendly and has an attitude I never feel like going back but I do because this is the only Chinese restaurant in the area I m so ashamed I found out that the owner had to pay out 2 3 million in back wages in 2009 to 813 workers in many of his restaurants in what the State Labor Department called the largest amount ever collected in a single case of minimum wage and overtime violations I assume that is why the employees are so unhappy http www nytimes com 2009 03 19 nyregion 19ollies html The food here is not great It is the only Chinese restaurant by Columbia University on Broadway The lunch specials are not worth buying because the main course comes in the smallest containers I ve ever seen I wouldn t order here based on the fact that this place is a sweat shop 
0BEdnNa6wpdeh8DfA4hMzQ Columbia We ordered delivery so I cant judge ambiance This is for the pizza only While the pizza had good toppings and had a thin crust It does not compare to the traditional NY pizza in that it is NOT made in a brick oven Therefore the crust is not the same Like someone else mentioned The crust is thin but the middle is soggy Also the crust itself is lacking in flavor The toppings however make up for this lapse The pizzas are SMALL compared to the price My bf was upset when he saw the size after paying almost 20 and getting a personal size pizza This is NOT acceptable Especially considering that you can go to the best brick oven pizzas in NY and they cost about the same price for a LARGE pizza that can fill 3 people easily This pizza was meant for ONE not even two people Although I wouldnt write them off completely They need to improve their crust size and cost to compete with the best NY pizza joints They do have the advantage of not having much competition in the area but they are OTHER places where we can get pizza 
0bGk5BkfHESW4ctsRi6-1w Columbia Certainly pricey for the area and tries to be more than it really is but friendly service solid grub Got the 12 50 Blackened Striped Bass sandwich on a soft brioche roll with pickles lettuce tomato r moulade Cheese was extra and no sides were included so for an UUWS lunch that s pushing it B1018 no starters were below 8 75 NOTE Happy hour from 5 7 along with Sip a couple doors down 
0BHjzSHgPDkCL9Aqd914dA Columbia Officially my favorite Cuban spot in the city Upon walking in you feel like you were transported to someone s home Dim lights classic wooden tables floor to ceiling doors and windows that are sometimes left open on nice nights There is also a live band that plays and people will randomly get up and begin to dance The service can be a little slow but you get past that once you realize how nice the entire staff is You have a choice of sparkling or tap water The empanadas are out of this world and you can get the sampler which offers three different options The mojitos are nice and STRONG I m not normally a mojito girl but let me tell you theirs are good Very good in fact We each had the shrimp mofango Amazing Plantains mashed into pork and shrimp with extra shrimp lying around your plate It looks tiny but it s extremely filling The dessert looked good too but we were completely full after our meal Slightly pricey but worth it if you ask me 
0bnBKYBQaKesrJyU3VDPAg Columbia Terrible food and quite pricy Just bad 
0bqD3Cdz1bs1bFwBNk-xJA Columbia For a cheap Chinese take out this is as good as it gets Wai Lee was a great companion for most of my undergrad career Its certainly comfort food And the delivery was always fast even in rain and snow 
0BQT4pvJMstDUCcCcSrKSA Columbia Very cozy and charming place I love the live jazz on Thursday nights and it is a perfect spot for a date The bartenders are very cool and nice to chat if you wish Decoration is classy simple but the place has always been a delight to go 
0BwTTpLFh75qBe0nA5Qa-Q Columbia Maybe it was the heat Maybe it was 4 per taco it costs for a small taco Maybe it was the tiny tables too tiny for not such cheap food And I know this sounds petty but it was definitely the fact that you couldn t mix and match your two tacos for 8 50 they had to be the same flavor I know other reviewers loved the early luchador style but I was not as impressed Having said that the food wasn t bad so the third star for that But because of the relative expense and small cramped tables I am not running back 
0BwXT1VPSrTIj9HlEN2tow Columbia College students mean bad restaurants in general Especially at elite schools they have more money than taste and places that cater to them can do fine while serving garbage Case in point this place Obviously you shouldn t order a salad they re inedible but even the bar food staples here have a whole lot of fail What IS that stuff they serve with the wings mayonnaise cut with Elmers Glue and flavored with PAM Certainly you would not want to put it in your mouth 
0C9yTwKNrb_qTT_7mNQfaQ Columbia Community is owned by the same people as Clinton St Baking Co however the quality of the food served here does not compare at all I ve been here a few times mostly for brunch since I think that s kind of their forte I ve had the blueberry pancakes veggie scramble and smoked salmon benedict all of which are similar to some of the menu items at their original LES post The blueberry pancakes are served almost exactly like the downtown location with warm maple butter but the consistency and flavor of the pancakes are very much different I find the pancakes served here to be much less fluffy and tender and somewhat lacking in the amount of wild maine blueberries they actually put in the batter The veggie scramble and benedict are also just standards not unlike what you d find at most American restaurants The whole wheat biscuit served here also pales in comparison to the ones at Clinton St a bit tough and too crumbly for my liking Community may be a good option for Morningside Heights especially for fresh American fare However if you want to experience the famous blueberry pancakes by Neil Kleinberg and his wife and partner make the trip downtown 
0CSkmWE4ZZUsAb-ONVbvQw Columbia Miss Mamie Spoonbread of the Uptown New York Spoonbreads dishes out BBQ and soul food in this homey establishment that requires a cartographer and a city planner to determine whether it s in Morningside Heights Manhattan Valley or Harlem This is more of a family neighborhood joint than say Dinosaur BBQ so save this for a quiet lunch dinner and not a night out Summary verdict is to stick w the soul food and shy away from the bbq Recommend the fried chicken sweet potatoes and sweet tea Longer version below Following Yelper advice I ordered the sampler platter and a sweet tea on my first visit This got me a pork rib a beef rib a fried chicken drumstick a piece of fried catfish and three sides Here s what I thought Fried Chicken Artery cloggingly delicious Not a food I crave much but much more satisfying to eat a piece of fried chicken vs a bland chicken tender or a reconstituted chicken nugget Worthy of ordering as an entree but make sure your co pilot orders something different lest the plane go down when you both go into a coma upon ingestion Pork Rib A lot of meat but the sauce was too heavy and sweet for me and the rib meat was tough Worth eating as part of the sampler or off a friend s rack but I wouldn t order it as my main dish Beef Rib Meaty and moist but equally satisfying and satisfactory I would ve preferred a tangy BBQ sauce over the gravy that was smothered on top Fried Catfish Quite light for a fried fish Accompanied by lemon and tartar sauce I liked it but it felt like Southern Fish Chips minus the chips Not that I don t like Fish Chips but it felt out of place with the other samples Sweet Potatoes Fantastic Brown sugar rests on top of the sweet potatoes and liquifies to the point where it becomes like a syrup Must order Mac Cheese Solid Lighter than I thought it would be The cheese is dried vs molten I d get it again but wouldn t come just for it Black Eyed Peas More like Fergie s face less like Fergie s body Collard Greens Delivered by mistake instead of sweet potatoes which thankfully they corrected These are an acquired taste that I ve yet to acquire Sweet Tea Awesome My sweet tea experience is mostly limited to crappy fountain sweet tea found in Popeye s or the Daisy May s version What I liked best about this one is the mint flavor is more pronounced than the sweetness Makes it more refreshing Red Velvet Cake They didn t charge me for the slice as I ordered it after the bill came I found it to be ok After having this and a few Red Velvet Cupcakes around town color me ambivalent to red velvet unless you re using it for an Elvis painting Service Pleasant Slow Mildly incompetent didn t fill my water even after asking collard greens instead of sweet potatoes 
0DDm3JGO6eyCG-0_bVwGNw Columbia I like Ethiopian food largely because it s spicy enough to penetrate my dead smoker s tastebuds But I have a shameful secret about eating at Zoma The whole time I just wanted a damn fork Homo habilis started using tools like 50 000 years ago specifically to avoid getting woolly mammoth juice on his nice velociraptor pelt or whatever I m not a trained paleontologist So why do this homo gotta use bread to pick up unwieldy chunks of meat sauce Zoma is a yummy mess Probably not good for a first date unless you re into some kinky shit P S You have to order the honey wine It s a perfectly sweet balance to the spicy food 
0DF_ca-LhcL6PTCoyUh8lg Columbia Ate here with my wife and a colleague for lunch While we didn t specifically look to eat African food on this day It was more a It s really windy and cold and everywhere else is closed sort of decision I m glad we decided to stumble into this particular place My colleague and I ordered the monkfish and lamb respectively and shared off of one platter using bread to make mini wraps with specific items My wife had sambusa a dish similar to an indian samosa The food took a bit longer than usual to come out however it was worth the wait The bread served was super spongy that allowed it to soak up the various sauces in each mini dish The spicy lamb was spicy but not overbearing and the spongy bread had a slightly sour taste to it not unpleasant but unexpected Overall I d say it s a must see if you want to experience a different dining experience than most restaurants in the area A good choice for lunch as well the place may be small but wasn t too packed when we were there at 12 30 
0dioEfPrMOmmag6I-PSlOg Columbia Came here with my dad when we were checking out Columbia University and the beer was amazing My dad ordered us each a 32oz with a shot of whiskey he wanted to celebrate me being accepted I guess haha Also the roasted chicken was WAY better than I had expected it to be which is always a nice surprise I will definitely check this place out again for the food but ESPECIALLY THE DRINKS 
0DrH2c7C3OY8tdTkj4WO_g Columbia Fairly nice decor i usually judge an Ethiopian restaurant on it s art displayed amongst a few other things of course and there is certainly some nice stuff here The food is fairly good I am going to give it 4 stars overall because the food is not horrid I would give the food a 3 5 really the service is always nice and they ve always had Harar when I ve been there which is a damn good beer I do wish that I could give it 3 5 though I d lay down a 3 here but I just feel like it deserves a wee bit more so I am going to be gracious Oh yes If someone ever sees a place where you can buy Harar in a store let me know My friend in New Mexico would love to have some mailed to her and I would love to have my refrigerator fully stocked with it 
0dva6w2in0pJMwg4zgpHWQ Columbia Underaged college kids check Barely enough room to breath check A line to get in This isn t a club check Flimsy plastic cups check Cheap drinks check Loud top 40s music check What more can you ask from a college bar The view is pretty nice if you are one of the lucky ones that can get a spot next to the window 
0dXEwHkue1FEJrxD_F2cJA Columbia I ve probably given one star here just for the nostalgia factor Since I went to Columbia in the late 80s this place will always feel like The West End to me I tried Havana Central for lunch today and found it to be average decent but not special It s good to have some options though I worked in the neighborhood for 7 years and found myself at Floridita 3 times a week Sad I had the special Seafood Salpicon salad It had shrimp mussels clams scallops octopus etc with olives tomato on a bed of greens The seafood seemed fresh and flavors were good For dessert we had churros which were warm and tasty The cafe con leche Adequate If you re in the neighborhood it s a fine lunch option if not probably not worth a trip to the UWS 
0E9Y_hiZ038M_XMFye04_g Columbia It was packed tonight w costumed freaks getting their eat on before the parade of ghouls St John the Divine Figured out what I wanted just by looking at the food passing by as we waited so when we snagged a table I was ready I had the smothered chicken w mashed potatoes and collards while my friends had the Friday fish specials w 3 sides instead of 2 Smothered chicken was suitably smothered in a gravy that struck of one note salt It wasn t over salted or salty but there wasn t any other flavor to the gravy But who cares this is smothered chicken so a gravy made out of pan drippings isn t gonna taste like much more than whatever they season the breading with The mashed is mashed and the collards were suitably smoky w a little heat and a not overwhelming amount of acid Washed it all down w the lemonade which was refreshing Skipped dessert cuz we were stuffed but I ll be back for more 
0ERY2HvLhTCEQlaNzdSQDA Columbia Good chinese food kiddy corner to the entrance of Columbia University Always packed with students Great amount of food for your buck 
0EsG6WWzp8y0uBDVXLj7Ow Columbia I had a great brunch at Kitchenette yesterday and I highly recommend the place I had a smoked mozzarella and artichoke omelet with roasted red pepper pesto and a biscuit the dish comes with grits or other sides but that was more than enough food for me the only bad thing about this place is how hard it is to choose what you want to order i would definitely come back with a bigger appetite and dig into some of the delicious sounding dishes on the griddle menu like vanilla bean french toast or pumpkin pancakes even though it s way out of the way for me I m planning to go back soon 
0EwXOk_Pf-JXrC0gx0q9-A Columbia I love chocolate What girl doesn t But this was the first time chocolate deceived me Talk about judging a book by its cover I stumbled upon this place after coming out of a nearby museum exhibition opening Originally my friend and I attempted to dine at the restaurant across the street but were turned away since they were about to close They pointed us across the street I saw the sign Chocolat and my eyes got big and I danced a happy little jig I was so hungry that I didn t check Yelp for reviews mistake 1 As other reviewers have noted I sooo wanted to love this place It was a Wednesday night around 9 30ish so there was no wait that was a plus Ambience was nice Marvin Gaye s Sexual Healing was playing sweet another plus But my giddiness soon came to a screeching halt It started with the wine The waiter super nice guy wasn t well versed with the wine list I ordered a bottle of Riesling and he insisted it was from Africa Hmmm I m not a wine snob but c mon man Rieslings are mainly German good ones that is France turns out a decent Riesling even Australia but Africa Pftt After he realized he was wrong he comes back to deliver the news that they were out of Riesling and brings me a Moscoto My friend isn t a heavy drinker so I went with it But it wasn t till I saw the bill later that I realized the waiter failed to mention that the Moscoto was 17 more than the original bottle I ordered That s a negative in my book buddy Not to mention the Moscoto sucked Almost 50 for a sucky Moscoto is not cool On to the food I ordered from the appetizer menu Baby Back Ribs 14 kinda steep for an app in my opinion with a side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes The ribs were just OK a bit on the fatty side The mashed potatoes were cold and chunky and did not have the slightest hint of garlic to them The waiter noticed my dismay and took my dish back to the chef for an added dose of garlic and a quick nuke in the microwave I presume It tasted a tad bit better but needless to say I didn t eat much more All in all a very disappointing meal My friend ordered the Shrimp Grits the most expensive dish on the menu at 26 I saw that he was struggling to swallow even a few bites I m not a grits kind of gal so I can t judge fairly but from what I tasted it was just not good And the shrimp do not get me started was the most overcooked shrimp I have ever tasted Wait I can t even say that I tasted it because I could not even cut through it with my knife That s how hard and overcooked they were When the waiter came over I demonstrated my attempt to slice and he quickly realized we were not exaggerating He was super apologetic I felt so bad because he looked like he was taking it as a direct reflection of his service They offered to make us another meal but we had enough already and passed on the idea The one good thing is that the manager removed the charge for the Shrimp Grits without hesitation But even though they removed the meal from the bill we still spent more than we should have based on the fact that we paid for the overpriced wine and tipped the waiter extremely well since he really did try his best to fix things Worst part all that money spent and we left hungry Sorry Chocolat but you will never earn my business again The only reason I granted you 2 stars was because of your waiter and the fact that you rectified the bill But this experience really deserved 1 star because the food was simply awful And it s all about the food for me 
0Fck0JjJBszcKpx6ze4ZpQ Columbia I can only really comment on the bar happy hour Being right across the street from my college this is a consistent go to spot for drinks for us The happy hour is a good deal all cocktails sangria wine are 5 bucks and they have some nice cocktails The atmosphere is pleasant with the upstairs being more laid back quiet and the downstairs more lounge y The food I have tried mostly appetizers were good no complaints The one time I ventured downstairs during a not happy hour time I think it was 11 was very strange loud music and what looked like nerdy 19 year olds dancing terribly If it s kinda late I d say stay upstairs Oh yeah and table service near the bar area sucks most times I ve been there it ll take at least 7 or 8 minutes to even find a waitress to get you another drink and they make it seem like chore If you re sitting at those high tables you re better off just grabbing a drink at the bar and bringing it over All in all I like the place 5 for a martini after a 3 hour class what s not to like 
0fkpR8udUM7GAwMkNu9Hgg Columbia We went on a Saturday for brunch and had a very nice time for the most part PROS The omelets are very big and pretty tasty I recommend the spinach and goat cheese The seven grain waffles were DYNOMITE as JJ would say The syrup was delicious The fresh raspberry preserve was yuuuuumy as well CONS The cafe con leche is not made with espresso Really Maybe living in Miami for several years made me a coffee snob but come on people The simple fact that it is in Spanish means you should not use American coffee ha The waiter had the personality of a snail or better yet a slug Would go back and order a tea with my meal 
0FTOanUEXg3Pr4rXwutmtA Columbia Super yum and super low key I like that there are authentic Mexican dishes alongside the football sized burrito maybe a basketball it is huge I have had the Pipian pumpkin seed sauce and Mole Rojo as well as standard tacos Bottled beers in the cooler perfect for chill dinner lunch or takeout 
0FZV4ctGjxEHWV7wwiOISA Columbia Sip is the epitome of an establishment that tries way too hard to be something that it s not The real question is what is it As Heather H points out it used to attempt a more Gothic pseudo Turkish approach to the typical Columbia bar The moody lighting and sophomoric drinks apparently didn t offer anything special enough for the the Columbia scene so they decided to restructure However instead of focusing they broadened their range Jack of all trades master of none is the expression that comes to mind and Sip does nothing right The drinks are all over the place like the terrible alcoholic Shirley Temple that would serve as a joke drink at a gay bar It could be the bartender as the ingredients of their drinks like their Last Goodbye or their mocha martini allude to far better drinks than are served Even more curious is their beer selection the bottles read like the line up at a mid western baseball game while their three beers on tap are two pilsners and a stout What the hell If a restaurant had only three wines would they serve two Pinot Noirs and a Port The food was the second to final insult for me Apparently the pot pie is the owner s favorite I m going to be optimistic and assume the owner lost his sense of taste in a bottle rocket accident The texture of the pot pie was fine but I m not sure how to distinguish it from a Banquet pot pie save for the two biscuits they stuck in it The mahi mahi should never have been on the menu but since it was I don t mind saying that recipes this bad aren t even served at Denny s Essentially it was low grade fish poorly cooked battered and served with lemon and some rice For 21 For 25 I could have had the pre fixe at A Cafe and had the city s best Pheasant Pate and Duck Confit At Sip you get a lump of fish and rice Yes as I alluded there was a final piece to the puzzle The service was terrible and they tack on a mandatory 18 gratuity At this point I don t even care to elaborate on my irritation with the mandatory tip essentially paying extra for terrible horrifyingly neglectful service as describing my anger is liable to cause a stroke Just know Sip is absolutely awful and you should write off the positive reviews as being written by naive college students that prefer atmosphere over substance Don t be fooled If you need a dank pit to drink in go to the far superior Ding Dong Lounge or Negrita a block over If you need food go anywhere else McDonald s even Message me and ask for recommendations Just don t support this place until they figure out what the hell they re trying to achieve and get a staff that has the talent to achieve it Or they give me my 90 back

0gdyV0TsDdd7K6QS8ADq1Q Columbia Disclaimer I m not 100 sure I m talking about the same halal cart as everyone else the one I went to was a little further up Broadway than the star on the map The one star is for the quick service Salad gross limp iceburg lettuce and a couple slices of nasty tomato smothered in white sauce White sauce tastes like mayonnaise straight out of the jar Rice eh okay A little greasy But the falafel Terrible I m sorry I ve never given a 1 star review before so part of me feels guilty but seriously So bad Falafel is supposed to have a nice crispy outside with a soft inside but this was all the same nasty consistency It was so old they had to cut it up into pieces and heat it up on the grill with the little chunks of meat sitting there so it ended up tasting like meat which for a person who hasn t eaten meat in 10 years is perhaps the most disgusting thing you could possibly do to your falafel I hate wasting food so normally I would just eat it anyways but had to throw this one out Yuck what a waste of 5 My falafel craving is NOT satisfied 
0gKkReJ6S-6BPSVIXagnJQ Columbia 3 5 stars It s fine Even good Basic Americanized Thai decent service timely delivery Music selection like so many restaurants in NYC is so bad it s almost good A different kind of entertaining I guess when you can spend your meal making fun of the music w your date 
0GkYzSl6he5Oe53EYm8SKg Columbia I had a burger and home fries It came quickly exactly as I ordered it Great spot I will order again especially if they expand the choices on the custom salad You have four included options with no mention of staples like carrots broccoli and onions 
0gs1HNYxDfSwe_b0AP0icQ Columbia Sip is definitely cool cant take that away from them but I found the food overpriced for the portion size I had the BLTA sandwich it was good I will prob go back but during happy hour or Mondays when food is half price 
0hkhOJFW7Q9O3hfK83Ollg Columbia We used to live pretty close to this place and got delivery from here on several occasions I am partial to their mango avocado chicken salad but I hate that on seamless web the default is no dressing instead of the recommended dressing but that isn t their fault My husband enjoys the chicken fajitas and I agree that they are quite good but it is necessary to order an extra side of guacamole Really their prices just aren t that great and they never send utensils with delivery despite my requesting them EVERYTIME 
0H_yptsDc4n1n92soyP6Lw Columbia Well as a Texan it is my duty to love all things deep fried especially fried chicken Just because I have moved to NY doesn t mean my quest for the best fried chicken has ended A friend from Texas came up to visit and was adamant about coming here at some point during the weekend Clearly he had done his fried chicken research and I always welcome anybody who wants to do the leg work for me Unfortunately we ended up here on a saturday afternoon after a particularly severe all night bender Needless to say I was in an equally severe amount of pain at the time I ordered my fried chicken but got it packed up to go because I knew I was in no shape to take in any solid foods However my friends ate at the restaurant and I can say that the service while I was there was nice They were quick to bring out the water and these little delicious corn bread cakes or whatever they were After a 3 hour nap I was ready to dig into my fried chicken and fries and waffle Even in my half drunk half hungover state I remembered to get hot sauce and maple syrup before I left The flavor was great but I prefer my fried chicken to be a bit crispier Now I know you re thinking that the quality was sacrificed because I took it to go but I had the forethought to examine the food when they first brought it to the table at the restaurant Trust me it wasn t as crispy as I prefer even fresh out of the kitchen But anyway the fries were delicious as was the waffle If it wasn t all the way up in nowhere 109th street I would probably go more often even despite the high prices 16 00 for fried chicken It s things like this that continue to remind me just how far away from Texas I am

0IOmK1I610NC7ZgtJ7AmlQ Columbia I came here on a Friday night with my friend Peter who lives just a few blocks from here and whom I know since our Edinburgh years This small Italian restaurant is cute and charming with a very nice wooden bar a huge mirror above it and wine bottles all over it gives out a warm and welcoming vibe By its look alone it is certainly a place where you could take a date The wine list is surprisingly short with just 4 5 bottles of red or white wine to chose from plus a house wine I certainly expected a bit more of a choice since by the sheer numbers of bottles all over this place could pass as a wine bar The beer selection also needs work the only beer they have that is worth mentioning is Blue Moon Since it was a mild and pleasant evening in October however we decided to have dinner outside Although let s face it the view over the Grant Houses projects is not particularly charming If you take a date here I suggest you stay inside For starters my friend had the mixed grilled vegetables 6 95 and I had the fresh fennel salad with parmigiano and balsamic vinegar 5 95 My salad was a bit disappointing I liked the oranges in it but the fennel was lacking that bitter kick that I was expecting Also where exactly was the parmigiano When I saw the homemade spaghetti alla chitarra with lamb ragu 11 95 I got very excited spaghetti alla chitarra are homemade egg spaghetti that are thin and square in section I love them and it s not easy to find them The dish is generous in size with a lot of lamb ragu which was very good Alas the spaghetti were a bit overcooked which was a bit of a disappointment Overall the bill was 45 each including tips for a bottle of wine an appetizer a salad and two pasta dishes The waitstaff is attentive and non intrusive The clientele despite this being Morningside Heights at the very border with Harlem was exclusively white 
0IsoVrs7EfPddv7ufCrjSg Columbia My girl Stacy showed me this place and it s got Greek down better than Zorba Fo realz The lamb kebob is fantastic and deyz even got a cheese they set on fire The pita is warm and tasty and you can t beat their mediterranes apps like the hummous babs ganoush and the like Tuesday nights you get a discount if y all rolling with the elite of Columbia Otherwise yo ass pays full price Either way it s worth it Oppa 
0iXF4pRfRHJiCIXLdHXheA Columbia i thought it was pretty good despite some of the other reviews the prices are ok service wasn t that great our waitress wasn t very nice i liked their combo options 13 for 3 different rolls and miso soup or salad not bad the sushi bullet was amazing the plate itself looked really cool not the best sushi i ve ever had but it was pretty solid

0juKRaZFHtqNeL011be7Tw Columbia Toms What can we say about Tom s Yes it is the Seinfeld restaurant Kramer s signed portrait hangs next to the front window The interior looks nothing like the set on the show The staff is kurt and abrupt in a way that many non new yorkers might consider to be very rude But for me it is home Get to know the waiters and they will call you by name when you walk through the door They might not say much else but why should they The place also has some of the greatest diner fare in the city Reuben sandwich is a must And be sure to ask for the Broadway shake It isn t on the menu but it is the best shake in manhattan Overheardinnewyork com Call it Tom s If you call it the Seinfeld Restaurant the tourists win 
0jXWer4d3AsOGoZtVCA7fQ Columbia DELICIOUS food I ordered the smothered chicken which came cornbread and my choice of 2 sides I got mac and cheese and string beans The chicken was so juicy and flavorful I m still dreaming about it I would have given them 5 stars but the waiter sucked at refilling our water 
0JzhDYBMNnZ06clJy1e0tQ Columbia Decent sandwiches and salads but the process of queuing to order then queuing to collect the food then queuing to pay is just too long and ridiculous if you plan to be out in less than 15 mins Plus I ve been 4 times and the women at the cash register never even acknowledge customers just chat amongst themselves 
0J_UVpImB5OMNHysMNx37g Columbia Toasted subs The hot cherry pepper rellish is delicious They have a good selection of subs but not as many as subway or anything though these are some good sandwiches They have salads and yogurts soups chips and sweets too This is actually the best deal on Columbia s campus There s usually a line but it goes by fast The staff are not the friendliest and like as your ordering the cashiers are yelling at you to pay already and it just gets confusing Just a nice little sandwich spot nothing to go out of your way for 
0KF_EOrWr9qjqkO8qCXmzA Columbia Good food An old fave from the 60 s 
0KVh6eR4k2jPiyJpPDyuQA Columbia I d wanted to try this place and was excited to get a Google Offer for dinner I had the ravioli and my friend had the burger and fries Actually nearly every table in the place had the fries they seem to be the thing I also had an uptown rye their cocktail list is small but artisinal and we had espresso and flourless chocolate cake for dessert Everything was delicious and full of flavor even the pasta which we vegetarians often get tired of as our only option My friend really got into his burger and was even raving about the bun I ll be back here especially when I need a nice restaurant for all American eaters 
0kZzyHaJi0xox-T9Xw0WYA Columbia It s pretty good But I d say it s very Americanized I usually order kra pow Kai which was delicious The service was quite unfriendly It was interesting that when I spoke to them in Thai they understood it but answered back in English with thick Thai accent Weird Why not just speak Thai The price is also quite expensive for the small portion they give 
0lA1L0FkZ67juuhiuhURfQ Columbia Came here for breakfast with a group and really didn t like it I had the spinach omelet and it was tasteless I had to add a ton of salt It was way overpriced and the service wasn t great at all I wont be coming back unfortunately 
0ldrs4wUHWes_bYS-UkHRQ Columbia Great place to go for comfort food It s a great brunch spot I love the macaroni and cheese and the key lime pie is Amazing 
0lGfzO70OnDoP5epAoWyFw Columbia Overall this place does pretty well good for groups despite its small size BYOB reasonable prix fixe yummy bread on the side The food is an interesting mix of French and Carribean While the food is decent it wasn t awe inspiring I would go back to this place only if I m in the area Not really worth the trek from Brooklyn 
0Lk-CXqvzVDhZInoNgOMGQ Columbia This cute restaurant is close to Columbia and I really enjoyed my meal here both the tastes the atmosphere was excellent Dinner had a bit of a wait even on a weeknight and they wouldn t seat us until our entire party was present understandable I loved that the food here is quite affordable and also plentiful for the price point I had their Proscuitto e spinaci 10 95 it was so delicious and really light which I appreciated because I find most Italian places go so heavy handed on their sauces creams etc They also offer different specials for the night but I would definitely inquire about the price tag my cousin bf each got their seafood pasta special and it costs 25 per plate Just so you won t get a sticker shocker when the bill comes Overall if I lived in this area I would most definitely be back 
0m-VmaiDJu-qOYAed5tSxg Columbia Well first off I would like to tell you not to eat here ever If its not to busy maybe stop in for a cheap grain alcohol margarita if you can get the waiters attention that wears an ipod while working 
0MDeZgoPqYggMormcFFyqg Columbia My boyfriend and I only order any one of the stews which comes with yummy rice and beans Oxtail or goat if you re into that sort of thing and they have a great catfish stew sometimes but the chicken with potatoes is always a safe bet Oily but amazing flavorful goodness bursting at the seams of the foil containers that offers tremendous value for money We both eat a LOT and one dinner portion serves two comfortably This is THE go to place for cheap and satisfying Latin takeout in the Morningside Heights area Oh the restaurant itself for some inexplicable reason doesn t usually serve the stews The place is SUPER loud usually and the decor contains every garish tropical cliche you can think of but the staff is usually very nice and portions are good But of course I write about the sit in experience just as a cursory overview again I say do what we do and get the stew as takeout delivery already 
0MFSY2jzu0iTIa4ljcoyxQ Columbia Returned for another positive experience with what is our favorite place in Harlem It would be better if it was 5 blocks or closer but we will take what we can get I am tempted to move them to 5 stars but the 4 fits Our most recent visit was on Valentine s Day which they took reservations for They messed up our reservation but after a brief wait and free beverages thanks manager on duty we were seated This night s menu was modified from their usual so no eggplant appetizer tear They made up for it with a Lobster Fra Diavolo which basically had an entire lobster tail delicious For more thoughts on Pisticci read my 3 earlier reviews 
0mgy6emSgVZZC0j6ltKuvA Columbia Big portions tiny prices for authentic Mexican food I ve been introducing friends to this place since I tried it with the armchair psychologist on this board and we all love it Being a serious carnivore I have no problems with the dishes being heavy on the meat especially when they are well seasoned and tasty Yes seating is cramped and at a premium but you can always order it and take it home However then you miss the fabulous chips salsas which are SOOOOO good 
0MHg4AVlNvCOiK_0DVGa-A Columbia brunch review There were some major highs and lows to this brunch experience There are some unique brunch items on this menu like breakfast risotto and a new play on eggs benedict The truffled fries are good However the loud bass at least in the front part of the restaurant seemed very un brunch like It felt like I was in a club Also the service was really spotty Our waiter made it up to us in the end with a mimosa toast which was really nice and unexpected I d suggest not getting the bottomless brunch drinks unless you really plan on being there a long time The bloody marys are definitely large but you need to drink two of them to make the 9 90 deal worth it 
0MJxu6TG_DufZDAJxjY1BQ Columbia try the blackberry honey wine tastes like an ice wine went here and tried Ethiopian for the first time last night had the combo for 2 great food the flavors reminded me of indian and malaysian didn t love the spongy bread flavor it was good to start but the sourness and saltiness started to wear on me after a while the staff is great attentive and very friendly cute restaurant 
0MWF-unzCb8tHkZa5K4_wg Columbia Such potential for this place We watched it go up and couldn t wait to try it Unfortunately though my turkey burger was decent my friend s gumbo was so abysmal she had to send it back it just wasn t gumbo In the summer it was as crowded as The Frying Pan only Harlem Tavern attempts to provide table service outside unlike The Frying Pan And the waitstaff is just overwhelmed during this time We were ready to leave to actually go down the block to Bier for their truffle fries to salvage our lunch and we had to wait so long ti find the waitress ask for the check receive the check get our cards back that Bier was between serving food when we arrived Sad I wonder if this trip s disappointment was just growing pains and I guess I d try it again at some point if only to support a local business 
0NCpgXCWQmx2YGitZYsWVA Columbia This is the best pizza in the neighborhood it s affordable and tasty real cheese nice ingredients for the most part Stick to the pizza though So far the salad and pastas have been really disappointing And avoid the bacon it s strangely gristly That said I figure a good pizza place that delivers to Harlem warrants four stars for this place 
0nFadolPQdWkDT52qylq8Q Columbia Five stars for saving the neighborhood This area has been a wasteland of crappy bodegas since Floridita closed a couple of years ago Falafel on Broadway is delicious and they have a lot of variety I eat here 2 or 3 times a week and never get bored Also along with the tasty foods try their Turkish coffee Its the real deal 
0nItDOsytv5h-AVrBgQBeQ Columbia Bought a Living Social deal to this place and showed up for dinner To our disappointment the deal wasn t valid until 2 days later We were already there so we decided to stay Horrible idea First of all the prices are outrageous not what is listed online A burger costs 12 and doesn t even come with sides or french fries Second the servings are really small which makes you feel worse about the outrageous price you re paying Not the worst restaurant I ve been to the food is actually okay But it s just NOT worth how much they charge 
0nK6hzoDmvcUhVpb5pyMlg Columbia Frankies with chickpea and potatoes are fantastic I had a lamb one too but was pretty disappointed at how dry the meat was I d stick with anything with peas in them Cheap delicious late night eat which is sort of scarce in this neighborhood 
0nOblZaNYVYR_ZMujwnjhQ Columbia I joined the Dominican for lunch the other day at Mel s It was a better lunch than usual that s for darn sure I had a simple Classic Burger and he had something with bacon and cheese on it And we ordered the Atomic Fries They were indeed atomic And delish We both broke out in a sweat So worth it The burgers are juicy and perfectly seasoned Not too salty They also have a pretty fantastic selection of beers both on tap and by the bottle I saw they have growlers though we didn t partake I walked away so full and so happy Call me cheap if you will but I find the place to be more than a little over priced Especially at lunch I don t regret it but it was certainly the most expensive lunch I ve had in a while I wish they had either a lunch or midday happy hour deal to address some of the cost I would go back more often if I could more easily avoid buyer s remorse Yum yum That is all 
0nZhUcpazr7rgRxnA-cldA Columbia I love this place The owner is GREAT The staff is friendly And the food is amazing Keep it up Crepes 
0ogB3T-kab3TRvrkGpTPkA Columbia Best brunch EVER My friend would not stop talking about this place so we all finally went here to see what the hype was all about and holy bejeezus it lived up to that hype My friend ordered the gnocchi pancakes and it was to die for My GF ordered the spaghetti and meatball and it was pretty damn good even if I am not parse to tomato sauce I ordered the chicken pasta in white sauce with truffle oil Dude that truffle sauce was pretty amazing I didn t think it would have made a difference but it did Ended the meal with probably the softest and moistest coconut cake you that will ever touch your lips It probably fell off a sterling silver platter in heaven and landed directly on our mortal plate at Pisticci s 
0OGyJbq8m_T6OX8AV0fhQA Columbia This place is ree donk cue less Incredible crepes for a unbelievable price I had a crepe with Nutella caramel and fresh tangerines My wife had a crepe with Nutella Caramel and spiced diced apples Needless to say we came in our pants it was THAT ree donk cue less The only reason I give it a 4 5 is that there were flies EVERYWHERE It was pretty effing dirty when you walk in The windows had finger print marks that looked like they had been there for well over a month I don t suggest you order for delivery which they do because once your food gets to you it may be cold Crepes aren t known for keeping warm for very long So get em and scarf em down but enjoy the diabetic coma you will be in from the orgasmic sugary rush 
0p5O2yZj_iyOlf1n5Oqg1w Columbia The food is just really good from the macaroni and cheese to the burgers It s a bit overpriced so it loses a star by me but you leave satisfied And they deliver 
0PiMjmzVMqR0vByEgEaadA Columbia I am not sure how to give this place 3 5 stars but that s what I would do if I could V T is good the pizza tastes great and the sauce is tasty but they tend to rush delivery orders so your food may be undercooked To advise ask them to make the pizza well done and wait another 5 minutes The eggplant pizza is my favorite but even when I was a little kid we ordered the everything pizza and I loved it We had their number memorized and the food hasn t changed except now I don t eat meat I still think this is the best pizza in the immediate area 
0pLYU_LcTilD1zwyjZBl_g Columbia I never realized how great Ethiopian food was It seems the ingredients in Ethiopian food are very similar to the stuff used in South Asian cooking Either way its all very good The wait staff and bartender are all very cool and nice people If you re in the mood for something different this is the perfect place to go Good food good atmosphere and a unique dining experience 
0PqISHQH88IiwYG45JwFjw Columbia I had lunch here 2 days ago and I didn t leave satisfied at all I ordered the avocado chicken panini but it took soo long The way to order is confusing for a newbie Ordering is just like a deli or a restaurant where they have different kinds of cuisine pizza salads wraps etc I think you order at the counter that has the menu above My friend ordered a salad and I promptly ordered a panini at the same place It literally took 15 to make and my friend was already half way through We only had a 30 min lunch break The sandwich itself was meh The avocado kept slipping off It wasn t a well made panini They put in a ton of avocado in though The grilled chicken was lemony It came with chips in the plastic container Not a bog fan of then but whatever To wrap it up food meh decor okay seating good staff nice Ps Someone behind me ordered a chicken cutlet hero To make it the took a chickencutlet in a plastic blaggy and microwaved it In A Plastic Bag No me gusta I mean I don t expect them to bread the chicken then and there but the plastic bag was too much Maybe I ll come back if I m truly desperate 
0pZNmVaS0xgHWG02giuxoQ Columbia Had brunch here one Sat morning five tables occupied when we were seated waited one hour for cold pancakes and french toast A friend at Columbia says that when their dept goes to Havana Central for lunch its understood that it will take at least an hour and a half Maybe slow as shit service gives points for authenticity but when in Rome The more traditional dishes ropa vieja tostones empanadas arroz con pollo are adequate and sometimes bland The Jazz Brunch on weekends is very loud and not always jazz The coffee is bitter and the staff painfully apathetic With better Cuban joints on the UWS Havana Central leaves little to recommend itself 
0Q7Aph9TLRG7Vg-fcC-qZw Columbia Tom s isn t as bad as it s made out to be but it s not good either Stay with simple things and you ll be fine Also you cannot leave without getting a milkshake Ask for it malted if that s your thing it s not mine The breakfast is decent and the service is quick if gruff Late at night you will find this place packed Sitting at the counter can be an experience but the milkshake is really worth it as the server glares at you Be prepared for some drunk Columbia students making a ruckus This is the closest diner to Columbia and it has simple things grilled cheese cheese fries eggs and toast that you can t get closer to campus at least for cheaper If you re looking for an actually decent diner I d head down to Metro Diner on 100th Street Also cross to the other side of Broadway to avoid being in the background of some random tourist s photo 
0qTPIpBMCkOogRQay2AdYQ Columbia CONS Snooty attitude Strong exclusive hipster vibe esp at the communal tables Service is unfriendly and takes FOREVER Pretty expensive PROS The food from what I ve experienced is a bit greasy but quite delicious Not sure if it s worth the long wait though The coffee is fabulous 
0r13zHrHhh77lijaqA6fhg Columbia One of THE best banana blue berry crepes I ve ever had Delicious 
0R4y7MOO_lD-0alCA68XEQ Columbia Around Columbia University Morningside Need Asian comfort food Come to the Mill It s got weird decor that is for certain The decor seems like something out of the Scholastic I SPY book I SPY a Singer sewing machine Nothing mind blowing about the food I wouldn t trek here for Korean but the food is solid and it scratches the itch 
0rEmsAOFOnJoJbSvL1Jpmw Columbia We have been going here for years and have always had a great meal It is BYOB major bonus points in my opinion and they have a pre fix for 20 or 25 appetizer and entree They use sustainable products even the drinking glasses are made out of recycled corn product and the food I think is organic They have great veggie options like seitan meatloaf as well We highly recommend this lil gem of a place 
0RfQEwdgulOlT9Cn491YpA Columbia Order snafu to start but very friendly staff Had the special which was sundried tomato ricotta ravioli as take out for lunch Excellent prices in line with NYC 
0rpxEEKoVL2h8RzKvW7CIg Columbia The food is OK What makes it special in this neighborhood is that it is so cheap It s fun to sit on the roof or near the huge windows on a nice day Service is usually nice and fast A good place for lunch 
0Ru1MDcfH-hWCH7KkxXlDg Columbia Don t bother 
0rZifozwhaDJ6KMGACQWhQ Columbia I stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch with my father We were searching for a place thar serves Ful an Eritrean dish The ful was tasty and good The portions were more than enough Food Service was great 
0s1-h27kOT0GGXEutOgRGQ Columbia This restaurant is a solid 4 stars Upon arriving we were seated in a loud plate clanking section where my delicate nose was drawn to the smell of cleaners and pine sol We asked one of the cool looking managers wearing ear pieces if we could be seated elsewhere and they promptly moved us to another section The glass of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc we had was smooth and fruity complementing the rest of our courses Must get the grilled octopus appetizer My husband and I both order the specials Hubby got skirt steak which I found a bit fattier than usual and I got the braised lamb pasta special My pasta was delicious but it was missing a salty ingredient perhaps parmesan to make it out of this world I asked the waiter for parmesan twice but he forgot The dish was satisfying enough for me to finish without the added cheese Overall our experience at Vareli was a pleasant one 
0S4mVrhhSfTsKRtBF_W_BQ Columbia I love this little cozy place This place was highly recommended by the owners of the B B during our NYC trip back in Dec Yeah I m a bit slow at updating bash me bash me We were immediately seated to our table We noticed that everyone around us had a delish breakfast entree I had the Kitchenette Special 7 which includes free coffee until 11am My partner had the Farmhouse Breakfast Each breakfast dish was perfect Coffee was tasty Service was great If I lived in NYC The Kitchenette would be one of my fave places for breakfast and lunch Awww I m so missing NYC right now 
0S759FCT4joMGAtfH_KcgQ Columbia IF your main criteria for a slice are that it be over sized and cheap and IF you think you d enjoy pizza whose taste and crust mouthfeel approximate sheet rock left out in the rain slathered with Ragu and Polly O mozzarella and IF you are heinously hammered craving grease and have just emerged from the subway on 110 and Bway and Koronet s lights resemble an oasis in the desert then by all means grab a slice here If on the other hand as a NYer you relish your proximity to myriad quality pizza places and wish to exercise a modicum of discernment go elsewhere 
0SeZDjZ64IO0nMiJI2u4Yw Columbia Went here twice already and loved both times The Bagel Deluxe looks excellent I had their Quesedilla and Fries once with cheese once w gravy I liked the one with cheese better Second time I went I ordered the Thursday special with baked macaroni and cheese which came with soup and salad With a small appetite I had to box it up and ate it up in three meals around 10 dollars plus tax and tip Pretty good The service is always good Waiters and waitresses are both helpful Enjoyed my times there From what I hear other than their delicious dessert their milkshakes are heavenly too I m saving that for next time Downside CASH ONLY 
0sk7vYafr-JnYpPx9tvRnQ Columbia I have a lot of experience going to Haakon s and I would recommend it for drinks dinner I get something different every time but at the bar I get the wings desert cookies or pumpkin pie catering or private parties I ve use both services to anyone Atmosphere sophisticated without the extra fee The Chef is the best cook and will work with you They stay pretty busy and Chef likes to be on the floor with his customers if he can He is a fun and warm guy even though at first he seems stressed because he likes everyone to be perfectly happy and to feel welcome I am there 3 times a week and use them for 90 of our parties I had a Thanksgiving party and Halloween Party for 75 people each On Halloween the party food was suppose to end at 11 00pm James the Chef kept the food coming out until brought out new appetizers till 11 15 unheard of anywhere in the city and without an extra charge For Thanksgiving we ended up having less people show up than expected and Chef made sure everyone got seconds which was amazing because the food is AWESOME Chef is also helping me with a fundraiser So it s a great place food atmosphere and people 
0SQ4RiwCBoaUC2qTLgq9mg Columbia Two words imitation scallops I never even knew such things existed and a reasonable diner would not imagine that he would be relegated to eating imitation scallops parmigiana for 16 not even in Manhattan Nevertheless there are some gems on the menu The pizza is reliably good The complimentary bread is quite tasty crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside I also like the broiled lamb chops simple and lightly seasoned and served with the part that most restaurants don t serve the tiramisu the chicken soup and minestrone soup On the other hand the pasta and side dishes are average The hardness of the steamed peas reminded me of stale Japanese style fried peas Overall 2 5 
0sQWQawQvvbwBIrM38OQCA Columbia The happy hour specials are great 3 for some great beers like Stone IPA and Dogfish Head but the food is uninspiring and overpriced for what you get I d recommend this place to grad students who are looking for a cheap good drink before heading elsewhere for dinner I usually find myself in the lounge area which is a little less formal than the main dining area It s pretty comfortable and I like the cavernous exposed brick ambiance The big drawback to sitting here is that the DJs and bartenders keep the music at a rather high volume for 5 30pm on a weekday It would be nice if the management monitored the volume more closely so that customers could carry on a conversation without having to shout 
0SQxys9TPaqGkTKvIqv3eg Columbia Went here for lunch today had the famous blueberry pancakes They were good but I dunno about great They are extremely sweet and I love sweet things The syrup that even comes with it is like melted caramel Again sweet My friend had a chicken sandwich which he said tasted like they used real quality ingredients The restaurant itself is very trendy and a nice addition to Morningside Heights although if you are a college student you might wanna go to another more affordable restaurant 
0T1rAbqy1arLsgM9ZKlrqQ Columbia Tried a few things and I think the Unda Aloo with egg is the best The ones with protein chicken and shrimps were alright I think they do vegetarian stuff better Mango lassi was good but nothing extraordinary 
0taEWvSQraGOs6hKgSWrNw Columbia I ve been coming here on and off since 2007 and can say the food is always excellent and you can t beat the price Lunch specials even on the weekends large portions and fresh great tasting food I m not a huge fan of Thai food but this place seems to do it a bit differently than the standard Manhattan Thai places If you re in the area I recommend it 
0tcxtoau4SlHWrpnosiAQQ Columbia There is only one reason I ever go to Apple Tree the chipotle chicken Strokos Milano s Subsconscious Westside and HamDel all have salad bars And while you ll probably get more food at Westside and better value at Milano s the chipotle chicken just makes my salad so much better than the surrounding delis that I ll always pick Apple Tree first Everything else about it is average typical NY corner market The lines for the cash register could be less awkwardly structured but that s a small gripe Story one time I dumped my entire salad on the floor of my friend s apartment He picked through it and ate the chipotle chicken off the floor The chicken is that good Or I need new friends 
0TeNSlvvHa7W8OlCiSCJTw Columbia Picked a good day to come Monday Taco flight day So I was able to order four different tacos to try chicken carne asada chorizo and carnitas for 12 They also had a beer flight but im not into beer so I skipped They had a good selection of margaritas but no specials on them They also had negra modelo on tap which my bf loves The decor is cute and colorful with images of La Loteria Luchadores etc The taco I liked best was the carne asada but did not LOVE it They also offer three tacos for 11 75 for LUNCH I dont think I could order 2tacos for 8 50 that s 4 25 per taco yikes I would return for a snack but not a complete meal I would like to see some drink specials that would entice me to come back Not my favorite taco place but somewhere I can return to if the mood strikes 
0tgsiDq5G8lDZL7oNLdDTw Columbia When it comes to ingesting raw fish and other questionable ingredients you had better investigate the place that is producing such items first before you do so Taking my own advice I ordered from Suma after I d read the Yelp reviews thoroughly And my investigation yielded mostly accurate results Yes the sushi is decent and yes they do deliver However had it not been for the wasabi that came with my Spider Rolls no not spider deep fried crab cucumber lettuce and avocado then I would ve been a little disappointed But it was definitely fresh I ll give them that And 9 for 5 rolls isn t TOO bad but a lot of their other items are higher priced However the delivery time was not what I expected it to be given the fact that I live a grand total of two blocks away Maybe it was the snow storm A lot of other reviews have mentioned how much they like this place in the absence of any other real alternative and while I d agree that this probably one of the only places in the area that you can get decent sushi I don t normally award more stars for a oh you didn t suck as badly as I thought you were going to award On days like today where I barricaded myself indoors I d order from Suma again But when the summertime hits I ll walk the 10 blocks down to Whole Foods and buy their sushi instead 
0tPFjaaZsElx6X49Yf6n1g Columbia Based on our visit today this newly opened restaurant places above Ozen and Asia Kan in the Asian fusion sushi delivery arena The restaurant is a pleasant addition to the Harlem Morningside area The atmosphere and type of food are nothing new except for the addition of hibachi Did not try the hibachi but will definitely go back to try it In general there were no surprises PROS bigger portions both the dinner dish of a Thai curry and the sashimi entree were surprisingly generous even the sushi a la carte seemed to have slightly larger portion sizes fresher fish than usual including the scallops and sea urchin which are prone to tasting off pricing fair CONS timing still a little off a bit of a wait for food dishes did not arrive together staff seems a bit hasty and not quite on the ball yet my friend had to ask for cutlery which was delivered in two parts The appetizer to get rock shrimp Delicious and crispy coated in a pleasing mayo spicy sauce Currently I think this place does rank higher than the average sushi place The only question is can they keep up the good work They ve only been open for 3 days 
0U0_O_7JSbpf9nHrpHJT-g Columbia I see that there is a lot of mix reviews on this place The only reason I didn t give this place a 5 star is because the restaurant was so packed that my friend and I had to sit at tall seats by a small counter The service was alright We went for brunch I had the sweet potato waffles which was pretty good and my friend had the baked vanilla bean brulee bread toast which was heavenly We also ordered the turkey sausage but it was very dry For a more thorough review check my blog http greenmilktea wordpress com 
0u1mypdyNJghC20NkyEPbg Columbia Been there twice and ordered from them I have no problem with the food The corn with the cheese and the spices is amazing I ve tried the chorizo tacos and the pork butt don t ask tacos which were also tasty Additionally their house margarita is good especially with the smoky salt rim That being said it is beyond me why you can t get chips and salsa at a time other than fiesta hour Seriously I think we talked the waiter into it the first time we went but it shouldn t require a drawn out conversation to obtain chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant 
0uBxHmkg_QhZK1K_NILmsA Columbia Went there on sunday with my two coworkers and first thing host said was you have 20 minutes to order before we close the kitchen We thought ok we want coffee and desert anyways We sat down and 35 minutes later we asked a waitress if she can help us because no one came to us and she had the worst attitude asked us what coffee we wanted and we asked to please see menu She actually never came back Bus boy started sweeping under our feet while we were still sitting at the table We decided to address this to the host and she kept talking on the phone smiled and said sorry So thank you for the free water and bread and the worst service I have ever received Mc Donalds and Burger King provide better service I would never ever come back or recommend anyone to go there Thank God I did not spend a penny 
0ucn52zcu0VH2Bq0nQBT9A Columbia what you order is not what you get You want french toast with blueberries strawberries and seasonal fruit like the menu lists Order that and you will receive a few blueberries and a ton of gross lardy filler in between 2 pieces of greasy bread for 15 Mention to the rude waitress that it is uh different from the menu and you will hear too rich for you huh coffee is NASTY But enjoy it because it wil never get refilled and yes you pay for that Over and over people write this place is out of ingredients and it is true But they dont have the decency to tell you that their new method is making something else gross and giving it to you You can go up to Tom s and have 6 french toast You can go to many places on the UWS and get great french toast Avoid this place at all costs I left 25 lighter and hungry They charge downtown Manhattan prices but give you something Bubba from Arkansas made from the left over swine fat Avoid 
0uTB94ar2sXGJY74NPy5iA Columbia I ve come here a couple times for brunch I have had a variety of dishes the waffles used in the eggs benedict are a bit too big and overwelming The service is kind of sucky but I usually go just to pick up some pastries I only like the brioche Definitely a hit and miss kind of place But there s wifi if you want to get some work done 
0uWiHQafTFHRn_7HD2YIaA Columbia BIGGGG good NY experience but the pizza was alriiiiight nothing spectacular I like my pizza cheesier quality was a little low too much flour remained on the crusts and bottom I would go to say you ve experienced a pizza slice that big but DO remember that heartburn will occur Also skip on fries over greased straight out of freezer didn t enjoy it 
0v27guP0PiiJoKcedHzTow Columbia GF and I order Thai market for delivery yay they deliver to us all the way up at 123rd and 8th I very much enjoyed my beef Pad See Ew Noodles were cooked just right and the flavoring was delicious My GF s panang curry with shrimp was delicious and the rice was great too I had not objections to the portion size of my beef Pad See Ew nor did my GF for her panang curry as other reviewers have complained about The delivery service was fast and reliable The reason this is four stars instead of five is that we were both disappointed by the Papaya Salad Just didn t taste right for some reason 
0vMt3iVzNWcge96yCsArzw Columbia First off This is not a flashy restaurant I probably wouldn t have gone here had the owner not come up to me while I was looking at the menu for V T and Columbia Cottage and asked me and my family to come in and try his place because it was family friendly I m glad he did This place is like the traditional americanized mexican food restaurant with a cuban puerto rican dominican influence that is common here in New York due to those communities being well established here The beans are black not pinto but that s ok because they do a competant job preparing the food I was pleased to see that they serve breakfast including chorizo with eggs which used to be impossible to find in manhattan I m definately going to come back and try it The service was good There wern t too many people in the place so the Owner waited on us and was very attentive The owner even offered to deliver to people in line for the Concert For Peace at Saint John the Divine accrosss the street The guacamole was fresh the rice had NOT been sitting around for hours and everything seemed made to order with fresh ingredients I especially liked that they didn t pile a mountain of cheese on everything and were confisdent in the flavor of the food itself Like I said this place is not flashy I didn t order anything to drink other than a jarritos but this is not a place where you would go to have drinks with dinner If you want that kind of Mexican food experience go downtown or to Hell s Kitchen This isn t a margarita bar or a beer joint so don t expect to come in and see or be a drunk college girl dancing on the tables 
0W88biFbzMfiyZ-SvS0v7g Columbia My friends and I had tickets to see Tracy Morgan at the Apollo so we stopped here for a quick dinner before the show The dining room is small but is dimly lit I think it would be a nice place for an unpretentious date So my friends had seen Melbas on the Food Network show Bobby Flay s Throwdown where they competed to see who had the better chicken and waffles So we went there with great expectations and wanting to try the famous dish Well when I first received my plate I thought boy I m going to be hungry And as I slowly ate my waffle I thought this is pretty good but I didn t think the fried chicken was anything to write home about However the whole is greater than the sum of its parts When you combine the two and eat them in one bite now that is a good dish I don t know what it is about the crispy chicken skin maybe all the grease but it makes the waffle that much better Oh and by the way the dish was surprisingly filling 
0WD9kfa8-Qv3N0fsbzxb1A Columbia I ve been eating there since I was 5 I recommend their eggplant garlic pizza 
0Wj7jiSfvb4NvXw0uH-BDQ Columbia My go to lunch spot for hot and cold subs They have a broad array of selections with a 5 special every day The line can be pretty long during the lunch rush but if you stick with non peak times you ll get in and out quickly 
0WRO6ydIa80voAud5Rhpng Columbia Zoma presents a somber escape from the street although the ebony hued bar back lit liquor shelves stone tiles and vast candle lit white walls strike one initially as somewhat incongruous more like a bar in a posh boutique hotel than a local family restaurant Nevertheless the warmth and attention from the staff helps remove any trepidation the severe ambiance might have imbued The two of us shared a combination platter served with ample portions of beef lamb collard greens and spicy red lentils The lentils and beef were our favorite followed by the collard greens The lamb was our least favorite as the meat overpowered the other flavors Overall the sauces were well prepared and balanced In addition they also served a side of chili sauce that combined cardamon and chili to make for a rich and flavorful accompaniment This was our second time at the restaurant and I m sure will be back again 
0WYjPMbl_lmXnI_XHAhoVw Columbia Massawa is not a core shaker but a really decent place to get your Ethiopian fix I ve seen Eritrean and Ethiopian people eat here so I suppose it s somewhat authentic though I m no expert I rather liked the spiciness of their tebsi special and the buttery laced texture of the stewed pumpkin Their lentils and carrot sides are okay The most important thing I must say is the fact that their injera is hot wonderfully tangy and layered on the plate Plus they don t take forever to bring you more Zoma an Ethiopian place with raving reviews on Yelp could learn a lesson or two from Massawa Massawa may not be as hip but it s more genuine and understands exactly what I need comfort I like my injera piping hot and plated with decent portions of what I ordered 
0x3LSFmAtI3i1vu3BPCOHA Columbia I liked it I can t find one thing to complain about Food service and price were all on the money 
0x4tejZ_Yh0eLA4MA_SsgQ Columbia Love the calzones love the garlic knots love the atmosphere The only complaint is that the food can be a little bit bland but that s fine because they provide you with any salt or peppers or cheese you need to spice it up I visit every time I m in NYC 
0XaWwIZnqBo-BKfVaNFamg Columbia Three stars mainly for the food proximity to my house and the fact that it owns Caf Fresh the establishment that used to be there a hundred times over The food is consistently good and I like the space even though it s typically pretty dead which makes the lukewarm service a lot more prominent than it otherwise would be I ve been there for lunch and dinner lunch seemed overpriced 10 for a sandwich I still don t get that but dinner usually has the prix fixe option for 15 which is a good deal all things considered On the other hand the service I would agree is usually subpar I ve only ever seen three servers and none of them are particularly warm or gregarious I usually feel like I m being rushed by the waitstaff which isn t a good feeling when you just want to have a leisurely meal with a book The food comes out quickly enough but I have consistently felt like the waitstaff couldn t care less C mon guys you don t have enough traffic to warrant the I m tired complaint cheer up a bit My other main beef is that the hours in the summer are really inconsistent Morningside Heights is one of those neighborhoods that does suffer from the lack of students in the summer but it really would be nice if they posted clearer year round hours for those of us who stick around 
0xe26dYPnri1PLIwB5Fldw Columbia I was prepared not to like it since I read many negative reviews Thought the service was nice It wasn t that crowded when we went though I ordered the chicken bail creme spinach savory crepe I liked it Could have used more basil creme since it waskinda dry for me bbut I thought it was probably healthier My friend had the French toast and dessert crepe He like them Though nothing earth shattering All theitems were made fresh Note the place was not crowded 
0YfvPvcuQLCe9Nv9JbjqBg Columbia Second best garlic knots in the city The pizza is nothing special but it s consistent not too expensive and pretty yummy But for me going for pizza is always about the garlic knots 
0Z--a_IE8VrEEVqExpH7Og Columbia Had a delicous meal here The B combition is very filling as well as the appetizers The only drag was the spicy crepe pancake it was very greasy Overall this is a great restuarant 
0ZjKpIEVwo_4-0VsoEoMWQ Columbia Barry Bonds Jason Giambi Koronet Slice Gigantic pizza slices for 3 That s all you need to know 
0zpp5Aga__7c82UxDLOYHg Columbia As other yelpers have said it s a good college bar with a decent beer selection and a wide array of mixed drinks I got the Caipirinha expecting it to be watered down but they definitely don t skimp on the alcohol which is a plus Waiters bartenders are nice enough Some minor complaints are that yet again as everyone has said it is small Be sure to go in there knowing that there are only two unisex bathrooms with gigantic lines to get in You ll be holding it in for the majority of the night but the cramped space helps with that 
0zZm8zQEIOtyf7W3e8tAtg Columbia For the honey tej wine this places gets 5 stars The food is good but I felt that their tibs wett was average And why was the injera cold I expected more for the hype that Zoma received That said I ll probably come back with friends as I do feel that the place is a great intro into Ethiopian food Will update more later when I go back 
0zZs2Np3s7mKS117VVWpIA Columbia Oh how I wish Toast was good We live on the same block and I pass by it whenever I head out of my apartment We couldve had a great relationship Alas the burgers are nothing special and they always forget ingredients when you order takeout 
0z_avI8DqFsO1i2sj75jmA Columbia The atmosphere is a high end diner with outdoor seating and part of the menu is written on mirrors around the restaurant creating an almost Parisian ambiance The food is noticeably better and therefore more expensive than Tom s Restaurant but on a sunny afternoon it is worth it I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich which included swiss cheddar cheeses and tomatoes and fries I have always found that the secret to a good grilled cheese sandwich is the tomato and so I commend Deluxe for getting that right I believe everyone at the table enjoyed their sandwiches too but just to warn you If you arrive around 11 45am or even right at noon for lunch and you shouldn t have a problem Show up at 1 15 and you ll be waiting until tea time 
0_2-rjEMdkVHUEnr-qWbKw Columbia Average Japanese sushi place Nothing special but it wasn t horrible either 
0_9fPRaoB_Xp-ix4syb_8Q Columbia The food only tastes somewhat decent when you re raving drunk Sober it s pretty bad The only saving grace is the BLT Milkshakes should be split between three an order for one will make you sick Try the pistachio or strawberry milkshakes if you must order one Remember Seinfeld didn t actually shoot the interior for a good reason nothing special here 
0_rtJS3NmadjRKZ_JBWHbw Columbia IN SHORT There are other better Mexican restaurants in the city But if you do come here get something cheap and just enjoy their free chips salsa and perhaps try their ice cold margarita A few friends from college and I came here for dinner because we couldn t settle on a restaurant in Morningside Heights or any other restaurant in the vincinity Although the atmosphere was nice and the margarita looked good I didn t try one the food here is simply average The chicken burrito that I ordered tasted bland and so was the beef burrito that my friend got and seriously I did not feel like I was eating in a Mexican restaurant However I definitely enjoyed their unlimited you can always ask for refills chips salsa but these fill you up pretty quickly I thought the service was pretty decent The waiters are always getting us water and refilling our chips Okay place if you just want to talk get some drinks and snack on something which you can do at home as well while catching up with friends 
0_xQH_zT364wYJr-XRluWw Columbia There s nothing bad to say about this place I went here on a Tuesday night It s a small restaurant front so it s easy to miss Once inside the restaurant is about the size of a shoe box By 8pm there wasn t a table that was empty and yet we still felt like we had plenty of space to enjoy each others company without feeling rushed The place is essentially run by one guy who is the host waiter and bus boy The kitchen is well non existent I saw one guy in the back throwing appetizers and main courses into an over sized toaster oven But don t let that scare you away because the quality of the food is not compromised at all this way Some other high points is that it s BYO with no corkage fee That s tough to come by in the city Although I have to mention you get plastic wine glasses at this place but to be honest who cares If you go between 6 8 you get an appetizer and main course for 20 Considering that their duck main course is 20 alone this makes for a great deal for those on a budget I d definitely go back for some more toaster oven goodness 
0_ziEfyEGNSgHIBUgurnBA Columbia Honestly Ollie s is pretty good chinese food If you re in the neighborhood and craving chinese just do it All you hataz it s chinese food don t expect a big production It s salty saucy and sometimes greasy just eat it 
1-IBKvePBi8I5Yaw8AnnJg Columbia Cheap fast and pretty good is exactly what this place is I went about 4 months ago and haven t been back however I would go if it were convenient I really did love their chips which was a sweet potato fry type food It is worth trying but not something I will go out of my way for 
1-iNhZ0gVUKquHKqjIRA0A Columbia Great prices amazing food Careful with the lasagna as it weighs about 5 pounds but it s SO good As are all the other dishes hearty is definitely the word for this spot 
1-KzpFxU2K6hhDwAPuS0Gg Columbia This is a cool after work spot The drinks are reasonable and the food is great The place is pretty small so get there early so you can get a seat The music is always pumping They play a mixture of Hip Hop R B and old school The crowd is cool and the bartenders are helpful and friendly 
10BsdKHLeUSXjN-UORjoqQ Columbia HOLY F CHICKEN F GYRO OK so I work nearby on broadway and was looking for something different to eat that wouldn t break my pockets I saw this place on yelp and I always walk past on my way to the 1 train so I thought I d try it FRIGGGGGIN AWESOME HANDS DOWN best gyro I ve EVER eaten taste fresh from the chicken to the veggies to the bread I should buy my Boyfriend one for dinner as this one will last me through lunch and dinner this is just tooo amazing I will definitely be going back on a regular basis 
10bUMV6Zp2eUPTQQeLQBhg Columbia I wish there were more late night places like this in Boston What can I say It s Indian in a burrito a burrito Make sure you get the hot sauce but be careful because it s pretty spicy Therefore if you don t love spicy foods then ask for it on the side 
10_ue8r3eSfjL-rrFN7CYg Columbia A few other graduate students and I ordered from this place to help fuel our end of the semester celebration We were amazed that they would deliver until 12 on a weeknight and we had a strong craving for Mexican food We also heard that they deliver margaritas in hilarious Chinese restaurant soup containers which was an added plus We ordered delivery which was a mistake Ridiculously crappy service and the fact that it was only a mediocre value kill this place for me The menu has a large variety of options but in my opinion prices were jacked about a dollar or two higher than what was fair and this takes a toll on the poor graduate student s budget Even though we made sure to repeat our order three times and have it repeated back to us to ensure it was understood they still mixed up two of my friend s orders and if one were a vegetarian it could have been the difference between dinner and no dinner Also they tacked on a mysterious delivery charge that caused my 10 Nachos to spike up to 16 when all was said and done and the delivery charge was split between 3 people There was absolutely nothing special about the food The best part about my meal was a wedge of avocado my friend had on the side of her burrito that she gave to me so I probably could have walked to Appletree Market bought an avocado and saved myself 12 I will likely never order from this place ever again and I d only halfheartedly recommend it if it s late at night you re desperate for takeout and nothing else is open 
11ljGnDIQtK87-vSfgHDdQ Columbia Hmm with so many good brunch places in the area I hardly think KU is worthy of the hoards of people it attracts I ordered the woodstock pancakes and they were good but a bit dry My friend s dish some sort of egg item was also pretty average Sadly overpriced and overhyped 
11XVh_L411bku81z0rSBcg Columbia Love this place feels like Italy a happy homey atmosphere great food at a good price The lamb chops are the BEST 
12GDPqkc9CXKE6cFE5qIvA Columbia Toast and I have a history You see there was a time when I thought I could handle Lex s Long Island Iced Tea Challenge The challenge was hard fought but somewhere amidst the 4th pint of well spirits and soda something happened Something blurry and dizzy And then I woke up on the floor of the bathroom at 5am with 26 text messages and an angry Lex knocking at the door I was arrested on Halloween just outside the front doors of the establishment I have dated women I ve met there bonded with friends and even met one of my closest cohorts at the restaurant Good times aside Toast isn t anything particularly special in and of itself For the Manhattan School of Music alum however its appeal can t be denied As the best local watering hole near the campus Toast has served students well in their after school revelry for years Judged purely as a restaurant and bar Toast comes out just above average The seating is uncomfortable and there is never enough room the bar is too small and the atmosphere is well forgettable That aside it is indeed homely They make a mean burger even if the fries suck They have great beers on tap and the prices are just right So my advice to you Don t go out of your way to visit Toast but if you live in the area or happen to be an MSM student drink up and enjoy 
12GsaBPLWWrc8MrCm9s9jQ Columbia Maybe the waitress recognized me All I can say is that at 11 25 am I decided to give them another chance I was starving I sat down 11 26 my order was taken at 11 35 I ordered Lentil Soup and Quiche Lorraine both daily specials I walked out at 11 54 still starving there were less that 15 customers in the restaurant and there was plenty of staff My waitress was having a great conversation with the bartender though I went to Vine good service no problem Sigh 
136Ch7L0nMpuHTJNdLReXQ Columbia Love the triangle rice balls Things tend to be on the expensive side but the sale items are great Check out line can be pretty slow sometimes 
13SCOUyXmwMJLRvgLBE3nQ Columbia This place boasts that it s more than just the Seinfeld diner It s menu brags about having the freshest and finest ingredients available The soggy tuna melt and undercooked fries suggest anything but fresh and the Seinfeld gear for sale imply it really is just the Seinfeld diner Also the staff hussles you like they got a line down to Hell s Kitchen even though it s only half full 
145-CcHnrnAIZ7GV5f6iwg Columbia I love this place and I actually think it s hands down the best soul food in Harlem That s not to say that some of the others aren t good but they are the only ones who get the spirit right and I think they just have the best food There are a lot of complaints about the wait and I ll be honest I m not a planner and I ve taken people here when I have the urge and have ended up having to wait longer than I would have liked even with a reservation But if you have ever eaten in New York you know the deal Furthermore the dining room is really small and I think this is one of the few times that the phrase intimate setting really does fit For two years I ve supported the restaurant because each time I ve gone I ve had fun It s one of the few places where you can go an eat and meet new people while enjoying a fine meal Perhaps the intimate setting plays a role in that If you re not a people person I wouldn t recommend going on Monday night or anytime someone is having a birthday the whole restaurant sings But this is what really makes this place standout At least for me it s more than just is the food good the service has got to work and here the service is peerless in Harlem Sure the wait may be long but once you take a seat you ll experience the finest service in Harlem Now the food I ve had lots of things on the menu but the chicken and waffles are great I don t like fruit at all but Melba has me craving for the strawberry butter with my waffles Now to be fair it s not a full waffle they are three small waffles which is fine by me because the bird is really the star of the show The crispy outer and juicy inner is exactly what fried chicken should taste like and when the syrup from the waffles manages to stick to the skin that s when the magic begins I love the macaroni and cheese but this is really a matter of taste I love how cheesy it is But those who don t like it I understand why I also love the catfish and the sauce they have on the side is delicious The potato salad and greens are also delicious I ve had the tilapia and it was ok and I m not really a fan of the spinach But those are my only two complaints The cocktails are also delicious If you want a full experience in Harlem this is the place to go I d say it offers the second best atmosphere yea that place with the Red awning may have them beat on atmosphere by a hair But I definitely prefer the food here 
14GWV_GGskgWUJJ0mShWmg Columbia Big slice but not very tasty Plus homeless guy allowed to go thru trash several times for slices and shake spices on not pleasant to watch while eating 
14y1yCQ_nuvdYkGUvzJQUQ Columbia I ve put off reviewing SIP because I don t want more people going there There I said it On the other hand I would like it to stay in business and while I ve struggled long and hard with the dichotomy of my feelings here I am What a great break from my usual Columbia University food crawl The music is always good and by good I mean good if you were born before 1985 and partied to real music I m not being ageist Well ok fine I am The music is even better if you happen to be in the neighborhood at night because they have DJs who spin the aforementioned good music nightly The food is on point and if you come Mondays it s half off Tuesdays wine is half off with 2 food orders You get free tapas if you come for after work drinks for happy hour 5 7 See where I m going with this Cheap food cheap liquor and free tapas What s not to love Well The space isn t big the tables are small tips are automatically added to your bill And that puts some people off I personally don t care I prefer not to do math when I ve been drinking to completely be honest and the service is ALWAYS impeccable so they deserve it thankyouverymuch 
15Cex1Kg-1fxwQ0PW0yEKA Columbia The thing that stood out the most here bad service like really really really bad service The WORST I ve ever had Granted we were here on a busy Sunday brunch time But when we were seated it took them 10 min to acknowledge us with no water on the table no utensils either We had to ask for water twice before it was brought out please sir some water I ordered a sweet crepe that did not come with any sides so I asked if I could have potatoes on the side You would think I grew a second head from the way the waiter reacted from my question it took him a long time to realize what I was asking no you can t have potatoes with your crepe but I will pay extra no it doesn t come with potatoes Our utensils were also supplied to us AFTER our crepes arrived on the table The dining room area also gets very smoky to the point where it is noticeably smelly I ve also noticed the lingering smell on my clothing for the rest of the day Not pleasant The crepes however were excellent I had the raisin almond and apple crepe They cook all of the fillings with the crepes so I was pleasantly surprised by my melted sweet apple filling However my boyfriend did not enjoy finding his smoked salmon crepe cooked through I would give Crepes on Columbus a second chance I think it might have been a bad service day for them 
15MASdG9-_w3lo8Mf0lMZg Columbia Just got delivery from Taqueria for the first time It came very quickly even at peak dinner time on Friday night And the food was still hot I knew you would never let me down Taqueria 
15vhCmOF5fja2StXeMFkOQ Columbia Their chicken and beef shawerma is really good My favorite dish is The Works with added chicken or beef You get some salad and from protein in your system I ve been there quiet a few times and I still like it 
16a4Z-RD6B7jJKCQhGDyjw Columbia I met four of my friends here a few weeks ago The food was good but the service was just eh We arrived and there was a group of five there before us but I wasn t sure how the tables worked so I looked around and went to sit at a table for four and grab an extra chair Don t do that this is a place where they seat you It doesn t seem like when you first walk in and most BBQ places I ve been too are seat yourself Eventually the five in front of us get seated and then my friends and i get seated They did have sweet tea which is a win for everyone and it was homemade and not that nasty processed stuff I had a pork BBQ sandwich which was really tasty with a side of baked beans I remember not enjoying the baked beans as much as I wish I had but my friends got mac and cheese and that was well worth it The sweet tea and mac and cheese are tasty and the food is good so worth a check out 
16gLyBFKvTm8bOhOg7JPmw Columbia Not a bad place to go with friends if you re looking for something close to campus Food is alright and prices are reasonable I always order the bento box and they give A LOT It s definitely worth it though Service is pretty fast and attentative but sometimes the place gets so loud that you really have to speak up to hear anybody Not somewhere I prefer but if you want to make a quick decision about where to go for dinner this is the place 
16howGeGR-YrH_BQljy25g Columbia We went here on a Scoutmob deal and really liked it The food was good not amazing although I ve probably never had a better Tiramisu in my life OK only in Italy I have The octopus was cooked perfectly so I would recommend that and if you want to try something a little different the fried artichokes on tahini was pretty good too I definitely would come back here if not for the food then for the ambiance It was very romantic and cozy and reminded me of good little restaurants in Europe Overall a really good find in our area 
16jDU9fe-zuc4WtDHSycMg Columbia Only one thing to order here ladies and gents the bibimbap is somewhat passable I never eat anything else at Mill A lot of people hate on Mill but really there s no other Korean food until 32nd St There s usually no wait here the interior is dimly lit almost but not quite to the point of being romantic The Mill your only option for Korean food not cooked by Chinese people in the UWS 
16lGjtls-rwrbNJFdl0KYg Columbia I like this small Italian spot It s cozy intimate ambience is comforting to even those far from the Italian culture Food proportions are a little smaller than used to but very good The staff is friendly and welcoming They do however have a limited menu so don t expect to get the usual from other Italian franchises like Olive Garden or others Meal prices are really good as well Relatively cheap prices from what I am used to especially from a upscale restaurant Overall great place to eat with friends or the special someone Full bar is available 
16PWskwUh_gkIsYYXz5vZw Columbia As an expert of brunch spots I would say this restaurant was average in service not a typical comfortable brunch environment and certainly not meant for rowdy drinking but above average in terms of the food quality and options This place is a lot fancier then the usual brunch spot and it threw me off This means that A You feel the need to wear real clothes and brush your hair at 10am on a sunday and B If you become intoxicated due to the unlimited mimosas you will feel very uncomfortable and weary about making sure you don t speak too loudly or appear drunk because no one else is For me the fact that I didn t feel comfortable ask for multiple refills and felt the need to maintain a good posture because there were elderly people and children brunching as well was a bit of a downer The only negative was that if you wanted to get the fixe brunch with the unlimited drinks the options of your meal were very limited I believe there were 5 choices They are all good options and good for veggs too but you can t be too picky The food was very good the burger was especially well cooked and very big the mushroom omlette was good and the corn beef hash was satisfying and unique with it cooked on a skillet with eggs The menu had a good selection with healthy and unique combinations for breakfast if you re not doing the fixe menu and they also had an extensive wine selection I may go back but not to drink and I would probably bring my parents because the average age of customers in the place was approx 45 
16RnE3ulM4e6Ni-AkfWEiA Columbia The place is really clean looking and filled with very nice looking sweets and pastries I picked up a cake and baklava the owner is Greek I believe for my friend s birthday and everyone was satisfied with the selections The cashier even gave us free paper plates and plastic utensils enough for about 30 people Definitely recommended 
16Z-T5ariYys3O1zjPPEkg Columbia This is a great lunch place Don t get too excited because there aren t any places to sit Perhaps they can invest in a little outside seating area I know it s just a market but it has the potential to be a little cafe Plus you can t just sell delicious food and expect people to wait until they get back to their offices to eat What if they want to eat it right there and then You have to provide adequate space for them to do so Ridiculous Well the food is good but needs a few adjustments Today I had the 1 2 lb of the spinach tomato and feta pasta and the 1 4 lb of tomato basil mozzarella salad Both delicious However the salad wasn t salty enough and the pasta was a little too salty My suggestion take some of the salt you used for the pasta and put it on the salad I know I m a genius Yesterday I had the mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich with balsamic vinegar I hated the bread It was some sort of a cheesy bread with olivey stuff on it Not good They should switch it with the bread they use for the mozzarella tomato basil and chicken sandwich I think that would be a more successful combination And on tuesday I had the spicy salmon sushi You really have to like salmon to order this for lunch No I mean really like it because there is a half a ton of salmon in each sushi bite But on a brighter note the sushi rice was cooked perfectly unlike the sushi in Morton Williams or in M2M which are a block away from this joint Despite all of my complaints I still gave this place 4 stars because I ll be back there tomorrow and I don t want anyone spitting in my tomato basil mozzarella concoction Not that they have in the past I m just saying 
17Aac5_4CSUlCoemkl1ZCw Columbia pizza crust 5 stars service 3 stars prosciutto on pizza was negative stars more like big tough chunks of salty ham Dont get the goat cheese and prosciutto toping 
17jxkbs6pwPlly8TYAKxUQ Columbia Went for lunch and had the steak sandwich It was delicious The atmosphere is nice My girlfriend got the salmon which is the only reason this wasn t a five It was bland and overpriced I would come back for the great sandwiches 
17Wx_ZHwOvb0zixdM1bfJg Columbia This location is close to my friend s apartment so I ve been here twice so far and probably plan on coming back multiple times I like this location because it s not as crowded as the upper east side and midtown west locations on normally busy hours The service leaves a bit to be desired as both times we ve had trouble getting the attention of our waitress waiter multiple times throughout the meal drinking The food is pretty good here I ve tried the chicken burrito chicken quesadilla and nachos and I think better than the other locations from what I remember The chicken is pretty flavorful and moist which was good The nachos come super loaded with toppings as well Other than that not much else to say about this place besides definitely get the frozen margaritas 
18-OLzyqFBxULb2BXIHiIg Columbia 1 Star because um where do I start I went on date to Vine The place is like very bad fast food place They seat you fast they take your order fast and take away your plates even faster As we were being seated an Asain couple took our seats the hostess told us that they were first but they arrived after we did Hum interesting or Racist They sat us in a corner by the kitchen As we were taking off our coats a watiress comes by and says do you know what you want first I think we have to look at the menu Then we ask her to come back 2 mins later she s back takes our order and then another waiter comes to take our order The food arrives in a matter of mintues less then 4 mins which leads me to think how fresh is it Not very the mash potato which I have yet to see in japenesse cusine is cold and stale The cubed garlic seasoned beef is tasteless PS the beef still had the fat attached nasty My date had sushi i tasted a few pieces it was OK Point is I only eat a quarter of my food because I was starving and was afraid to order anything else Customer service does not exist at Vine Food Quality is comparable to the worst fast food you ve ever had 
18qDySrIWDDJ1I7N1Ak5Xw Columbia holy shit omelettes that s all this is about omelettes they make them all day why would i ever order anything else oh wait they also make a brie green apple avocado sandwich that made me cream my pants ok fine holy shit omelettes and brie green apple avocado sandwiches good God almighty i knew i liked omelettes but i never knew the depth of that now DEEP love i also didn t think i liked fancy sounding sandwiches that was before i realized there is nothing fancy about putting brie apples and avocado on delicious homemade bread just something creative ingenious and freaking DELICIOUS 5 stars all day and all night they serve omelettes all day why would you ever get anything else unless its the aforementioned sandwich p s im sure the rest of their menu is astounding but i havent moved on from omelettes and brie green apple avocado sandwiches if you couldn t tell 
18QJ139e09WzLmotbORZ2g Columbia Cheap and delicious grill food great for grabbing an Asian snack or drink between classes 
18ytiDS0kKZwJx8-AOd_mg Columbia The garlic naan was really thick and garlicky and yummy Service was good Chicken curry was ok but the meat tasted a little old The Navratta Korma was blah The peas were undercooked and the sauce tasted thin They were also supposed to be spicy and medium respectively but neither was very hot at all The entrees came with giant portions of rice but the rice was clumpy and not fragrant 
18zrkSOoCpy-Ttv-rTolQA Columbia The proper name of this place should be Comfort and Compromise comfort because the residents have a dining option within the house elevator and compromise because they truly compromise many standards by dining there I eat at Barnard Columbia locations more often since the only consistently reliable option is a breakfast Other meals tend to support a high carb and low taste diet which I am not a particular fan of So it s 1 from 1 star for convenience but not a dime more 
1A37MfeNhAGcOiXHjUlDeA Columbia The ambiance and decor is the only reason why I m giving 3 stars I came here to celebrate my youngest sister s birthday and I was underwhelmed by their service and the attitude of of server It was 6 of us and 3 other seated around the grill and after about 15 minutes of waiting we were told to be patient because there was only one chef on that night Can you explain to me why there was only one hibachi chef that night The chef was great he did the same tricks throwing food in our mouths volcano in he onions that you would see at restaurants alike and made the experience great 4 6 of us ordered from the grill except for me and one of my other sisters because I am allergic to shellfish and I was without my EpiPen Apparently they have a rule where 5 6 have to order from the grill in order to be seated there I m not sure why they shared that with us because the place was practically empty The food was very bland and definitely did not wow me 
1aHIp8ZlQKas3zxwvgyVDQ Columbia I consider myself Vareli s first loyal customer I ve been going here since they had paper menus My roommate and I lived right around the corner and witnessed the transformation from hardware store to lovely restaurant The bartenders are amazing one a literal rockstar The upstairs has been home to many of my pals events engagement party graduation dinner birthday dinner and is the best place to reunite with college pals It s pretty much my St Elmos Fire My recommendations the cheese platter the homboldt fog is amazing lamb burger and roasted chicken Last but not least my personal favorite barcardi and coke I miss you guys 
1aYEGwlOU4jrLelhPQFb8Q Columbia I would like to preface this review by saying that I am not a rack and soul kind of girl In fact I generally don t eat anything that formerly had a rack so I m probably not the best judge of this place That being said I popped in to Rack and Soul for a late dinner snack last night It opened this past summer to very good reviews and I am sure that all of the applewood smoked BBQ stuff is very good Upon sitting they immediately brought over a sample of warm cornbread which was excellent a nice combination of sweet and savory I ordered the three side platter 10 and picked mac cheese mashed potatoes and collard greens Given that excess butter and salt are supposed to be the main ingredients in these dishes that s what makes them taste good I still think they were all a little too salty The collard greens came with bits of BBQ pork in it which I wasn t crazy about but it added a lot of flavor The mashed potatoes and mac and cheese were good but not great In terms of side dishes Mamie s Spoonbread a few blocks away probably has them beat Overall I think the atmosphere of this place is really cute It has a warm diner feel with a long counter and cushy red booths It also does a nice job meshing the spirit of Harlem with the gentrification of the Upper West Side I think it is a welcome addition to the neighborhood 
1b6JreBchfUoYP82Zko_YQ Columbia The day after I posted my first review of Haakon s Hall I received a message from James the chef owner apologizing profusely for the bad service we had and asking for a second chance The following week I went back with most of the same group and he made sure the menu item I had asked about was available the service was friendly and attentive a different waitress and he even came out to personally check on us several times He also offered us an amuse bouche that I didn t have but I gave my portion to the Norwegian guest at our table and he and everyone who tasted it thought it was delicious Since my original review was not based on the food but only one individual I decided to update the review after they made sincere efforts to address their customer s complaints and provided a very positive experience on our second trip 
1bfELvtQe_KCBErhbIFymA Columbia Just tried this spot out after starting a new job in the area I was so glad to find something reasonably priced Now I know why it s so much cheaper than anything else nearby I ve never had falafel as bland or dry as Amir s before It was like sawdust but flavored with a synthetic falafel seasoning from a packet There was little else in the pita pocket except some bits of lettuce and a flavorless tomato I also ordered some kind of heavy chewy smelly dough that was posing as a spinach pie I saw the spinach I was looking RIGHT AT the spinach but I couldn t taste any spinach when I was finally brave enough to taste the thing I hate wasting a lunch I m still so hungry and am stuck in meetings for the next couple of hours so please take this review to heart if you feel the same way 
1bFlYGrnoO5f88dJXffIbA Columbia The experience I had at this restaurant with my wife and two friends with almost identical to the one described by Chris T We recently saw that a new place was opening and wanted to try it our for a few reasons 1 it s in our neighborhood a couple of blocks from my apartment 2 my wife and I are Mexican and it s really difficult for us to find some great tasting Mexican food in NYC So when we walked in and were greeted within a minute or so shortly after that with some chips from a package and salsa identical to Pace Picante we were off to an okay start We each ordered food I had the chipotle chicken burrito my wife had the steak burrito and my two friends had mole dinner plate and the shredded chicken burrito Though my burrito wasn t too bad due mainly to the taste of the chipotle sauce it certainly was not worth the 9 25 I was charged for it especially since the menu said it was 8 50 Having been open for a week there couldn t have already been price increases My wife s steak burrito well I ll just borrow from Chris T s review the meat was bland dry and overcooked it also lacked a binding agent e g meat marinade or salsa Neither of the two salsa sides added much flavor spicy or otherwise to distract from the dry meat My friend who ordered the shredded chicken burrito almost choked on the dry meat and ordered a side of sour cream thinking it might help They brought her a container obviously designed to hold no more that a tablespoon of an ingredient with what literally looked like watered down sour cream She was disgusted and not only didn t eat the sour cream but also gave up trying to eat the burrito OH and they charged her 2 for that side of sour cream Now mediocre food should at least be made up with great service but don t hold your breath here Our waiter after the initial greeting took forever to come back to our table forgot more than once of the items that had been requested another soda the side of sour cream etc and though only carrying four plates could not remember who ordered what or what the plates even were I mean he literally stood there for at least a minute trying to decide which burrito was which before he decided he should take them back to the kitchen for clarification Luckily my friends and I are close enough that we told him just to leave them and we d sort them out And mine was wrong Not only did it not have the shredded chicken in chipotle sauce as advertised on the menu but it was extremely dry grilled chicken with no guacamole or chipotle sauce AT ALL on the plate In short less than mediocre food terrible service horrible value This is one addition to the neighborhood I was not glad to have experienced My wife and I will not be returning there Apologetically only for what now feels like a betrayal on my part for not having said this sooner I highly recommend that you instead go to my favorite Mexican food spot just three short blocks away Taqueria y Fonda la Mexicana which is better priced in terms of value better in taste just better all around 
1BfuuWmGuLbqGTuinD-qOA Columbia My boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner after checking out the Central Park pool I didn t know what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised We walked thru the doors and were immediately welcomed by the staff and seated After taking a couple of minutes to scan the menu I decided on that pappardelle pasta and my boyfriend opted for the beer and burger special We got a side of the corn and mushrooms Everything we had was delicious You could tell that the staff took their food and the restaurant seriously This place is definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood 
1Bm-YLw0zCUDXlMQ9bd7VA Columbia I ve eaten enough brie here to kill a lesser man 
1BuLlkR_ZNMOBrDqdvxHcg Columbia One of my favorite soul food spots in NYC If you are travelling with a large group or want to visit this place during peak periods then you will be disappointed This is a small establishment but definitely worth the trip A note to those of you looking for your Mama s or your Nana s homecooking stop making comparisons or just go to your beloved s house for a meal Spoonbread serves excellent food and is one of the best in Harlem I love the food here I have been coming here since Ms Mamie opened My meal tonight Smothered Turkey Wings Cornbread Stuffing Collard Greens Candied Yams And yes I ate it all 
1BUYiiFhPN5T1M0YfOzz8w Columbia I must say I was very disappointed Ive read many many good reviews but my experience was not as good as many others I guess Had the chicken breast which was cooked nicely but tasted like any rotisserie chicken from Dallas BBQ my boyfriends salmon on the other hand was dried and had no taste even when we mixed it with the vinaigrette it was horrible The only thing worthy was probably the view 
1BVI1a-tu8n2vd2RwY9pUA Columbia I ve never been disappointed with a meal here In fact I just get the special without asking sometimes because I know it will be great My father born and bred in Italy considers this place the most authentic Italian in New York I know it s far uptown but trust me it s worth it 
1bvxWr0Azue1RBWpQr5aQQ Columbia OMG one of the most terrible dining experiences I ve ever had I stopped by here after seeing the high ratings on my yelp mobile I was craving good Caribbean food and didn t have the time to head all the way to Queens or Brooklyn I walked in and was barely greeted by the waiter cashier After looking at the menu I decided on a lunch special and got the brown stewed chicken rice and peas and candied yams I decided on the stewed chicken because being Caribbean myself I figured that it was a dish that would be hard to mess up As I got my food two other women walked in and were clearly really excited to try this place They asked me what I had ordered and were going over the menu saying ooh this looks good or maybe I should try that Then the waiter came over to them and very unenthusiastically asked if they were ready to order One of the women looked at this stunning example of poor customer service and said Are you tired He said No I m not She said sweetly Oh because you re dragging your feet I got the clue that she was saying that his service sucked but he looked at her indignantly said Well ma am I have a lot of steps to make in a day I do a lot of walking around okay I was disgusted by his attitude and by my nasty ass brown stewed chicken and overly sweet candied yams that I took three bites of and couldn t even bring myself to finish I packed it to go but threw it in the garbage bin on the corner Never again 
1cI3g2d-c5QzhwkxMPHl4Q Columbia Nathaniel B you are right on track Radio is the Columbia U hangout especially on Thursday night when Teachers College goes bad Drink specials and spirited bartenders make this a nice place to be a regular This past week things mixed up like a 5 ingredient cocktail The lights in the front part of the bar went down and the DJ mic went way up He said I didn t come ALL the way up here for nuthin and really rocked it out with hip hop spanning the ages Fun crowd that stays around the front bar and sometimes spills onto the outdoor patio Drink specials are something else on Thursday night Word to the wise it s loud 
1cItm7l_NkUlfmdooHG6Cw Columbia Not my go to sandwich shop I often feel as though I try new things only to be disappointed and I try old stand by options only to find them a little bland or dry I know they re in a hurry and move people though the line with speed but the food is not all that great If you want a comparable sandwich for the same price go to M2M For all the people with offices on the Amsterdam side of the block keep eating at HamDel so you don t add to the M2M line 
1cnLJiHUCd9uFKwfxwM8tw Columbia not your average gyro i love lamb Hooda takes the time to make sure the pita is perfectly warm and pliable then puts on just enough lettuce and tomato for freshness not just taking up space from the meat the meat i like freshly shaved Donner lamb but for this gyro he shaved it and throws it on the flattop with special sauce and a few other treats like carrots for natural sweetness Flavors meld and meat crisps jus a bit more before he loads it on to the awaiting pita so good and just 4 
1CXoy7kB3WgX54osZvjnFg Columbia I love French food and Le Monde is decent I went here for lunch on a weekday and the service was quick I started with a cheese plate and their Roquefort was so good The other cheese not so much I had a steak frites for lunch My boyfriend had the croque monsieur Croque monsieur was underwhelming Steak frites was ok I asked for medium and it was pretty much well done Will I go back Probably not 
1cY9XJAnWx9p_w8QhzFhhw Columbia We came here for dinner and ordered savory dinner crepes The staff was helpful answering questions and making recommendations The food came out promptly and was delightful A nice touch was when the waiter split our dessert for us I ll be back for sure 
1DEWEze0ZhUQLgIridn5PA Columbia This place makes excellent sandwiches I would say that they are expensive but compared to other Columbia U area sandwich purveyors the pricing is standard while the quality of the ingredients is much much higher They have some really excellent multigrain rolls lots of nice cheeses and many creative daily sandwiches The only downside really is that the line is long but it tends to move quite quickly and it s worth the wait 
1dMXOmeugqY2xEdTZk96RA Columbia A very contemporary space with open windows a sleek bar an open kitchen and lots of orange colored accents Concept wise the restaurant wins boasting fresh seasonal local produce along with certification of being green Unfortunately the food doesn t always live up to Clinton St Bakery expectations and the menu is somewhat pricey for the portion size Juice bar is also very pricey I stopped in on my way to class and coughed up 7 for a regular smoothie Still although the price point definitely puts it out of range for most students it hasn t stopped the place from being packed every night thus far I suppose Community would be better if they had better service The first hosts hostesses were awfully rude and unaccommodating which was kind of understandable during its opening hijinks but not so much now Months later hostesses are still rude and waiters remain nonchalant and inattentive with little knowledge of what s on the menu I ve been about three or four times since and while the food has gotten better at times even crave worthy the entire dining experience is always a little sour 
1DPjKYIgS4NxcGeWNeKFZQ Columbia The food is good Nothing amazing Their chilli sauce is good but I always feel sick after eating Service is awful They simply dont care about you 
1Du6L-9XQaEpEyQzIeDTZw Columbia Solid place Nice atmosphere good food good date spot Prices are reasonable service is fine 
1dVmrGsEbOtUw8oyqSHS1A Columbia I have never had five guys so I wanted to try it out when it moved into my neighborhood The difference between the Little and the regular burger is the patties The little comes with one patty and the regular comes with two I got the little as that is usually how many patties I eat I also had the cajun fries which are the same price as the regular fries but come with seasoning The price is comparable to Shake Shack so not the cheapest but moderately priced The two patties is more expensive than one obviously and you will pay for it Total price for two people was about 20 sharing the fries and the drink I ordered the little hamburger and added mushrooms lettuce tomatoe and mustard ketchup I forgot the pickles The burger tasted good but the bun wasnt as toasted as I would like and got soaggy quickly I like that you can add the toppings you would like though The fries were good with the seasoning but could use more crunch Overall I enjoyed my burger but this is not my favorite burger place in New York Will come back if I am around and in the mood though Place is popular with all though and are usually busy but plenty of seating to be had Not a place you go to for ambiance but for convenience and a burger 
1dw1CCiG76YiXbf-uQF6Pg Columbia My homegirls and I had a great boozy brunch at Lido s The service was excellent and the unlimited mimosas were poured generously and with a smile My friends refered to them as light skinned mimosas since they are light on the OJ heavier on the champs My food was just okay I had the omelet with rock shrimp which was had three little shrimp pebbles in it It was served with greens and was a little bit boring nothing I couldn t whip up at home I know that I chose my entree poorly because all of my friends food looked and smelled so much better than mine I snuck a taste of the pasta with veal meatballs which was absolutely amazing I d recommend that For dessert we shared chocolate buddino Oh my sweet and salty heaven I m not usually a mouse pudding person but I loved that buddino to the point I wished I had my own portion All the servers were really nice I was pleasantly surprised that the service was so efficient after reading some of the yelp reviews Our waiter was charming and attentive We were allowed to linger and enjoy our meal and even when they needed our table the welcomed us to hang out at the bar My overall experience was pretty good I d say give it a try 
1dxFIT-m5u_624d9Lhy0_g Columbia The view is nice but the food was only average The lunch specials are priced right and will certainly fill you up 
1E1QyYfN3nEk9AV-zXim-w Columbia I went there again tonight yes I had pizza for two meals today and it was awesome I almost went back for one more slice So big and so good 
1e1VzZ-quqvqtkeLXNlAgg Columbia This wonderful Crepe place opened about 6 months ago near my apt and I was very excited My favorite crepes were Ham with cheddar cheese and Bacon Avacodo Basil Crepe I recently ordered and saw that they still have a grade pending inspection grade which peeked my curiousity since it is located in a brand new streetfront and appears to be impeccably clean inside To my horror I found that on June 29 they were rated a C because of Violation points 54 1 Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility s food and or non food areas 2 Live roaches present in facility s food and or non food areas 3 Hand washing facility not provided in or near food preparation area and toilet room Hot and cold running water at adequate pressure to enable cleanliness of employees not provided at facility Soap and an acceptable hand drying device not provided 4 Food not protected from potential source of contamination during storage preparation transportation display or service 5 Food contact surface not properly washed rinsed and sanitized after each use and following any activity when contamination may have occurred 6 Facility not vermin proof Harborage or conditions conducive to attracting vermin to the premises and or allowing vermin to exist Last week on 9 1 11 Crepes on Columbus was actually closed because of the following Violation points 70 Sanitary Violations 1 Cold food item held above 41 F smoked fish and reduced oxygen packaged foods above 38 F except during necessary preparation 2 Food Protection Certificate not held by supervisor of food operations 3 Appropriately scaled metal stem type thermometer or thermocouple not provided or used to evaluate temperatures of potentially hazardous foods during cooking cooling reheating and holding 4 Insufficient or no refrigerated or hot holding equipment to keep potentially hazardous foods at required temperatures 5 Food contact surface not properly washed rinsed and sanitized after each use and following any activity when contamination may have occurred 6 Sanitized equipment or utensil including in use food dispensing utensil improperly used or stored 7 Plumbing not properly installed or maintained anti siphonage or backflow prevention device not provided where required equipment or floor not properly drained sewage disposal system in disrepair or not functioning properly 8 Proper sanitization not provided for utensil ware washing operation Since they now are open again I hope that all of the violations they have been cited for have been corrected I honestly won t be able to eat here again until I see an A inspection outside 
1e4eg3JeGEIn1Pnc6D2OIQ Columbia Alright alright I only came here just because I saw it on Throwdown Okay I admit the only thing I ordered was the chicken and waffles Okay I m just another stupid tourist Fine I ll take it You know I must have been watching a different show or something because the Melbas I saw on TV and the Melbas I sat in were night and day The one on TV looked like it was just some hole in the wall place and this Melbas was fancy pancy very modern and chic Where did I mess this up Anyway the ambiance and decor were NOT what I expected but it was really nice either way We walked in just when the lunch service was at its end The lady who sat us down said she d have to ask Melba if she could take another order and Melba herself said no problem and she d love to have us AWESOME She even came out and was running around saying hello to everyone I love it when restaurant owners do that So of course we had the eggnog waffles with chicken of course Duh Yes it was delicious yes it was everything i expected It was a little fancier than I thought it would be I was hoping for a little more homestyle with big ugly waffles and the chicken right on top Nonetheless it was delicious My biggest peeve when getting fried chicken is soft skin and dry inside This was CRISPY outside and perfectly cooked and moist inside THANK YOU The only thing I didn t care for was the biscuit with the smuckers grape jelly I figure with the quality of her chicken and waffles that she would make her own grape jelly it s not hard for pete s sake oh well I m not sure if next time I visit Harlem I ll come back but it was a good experience 
1e7gazwzC4c36MOK4Cp2Qw Columbia Don t come here for the food If you do you ll be very disappointed because it s mediocre at best Come for the atmosphere I went last night and Gloria Ry ann a neo soul singer performed Fantastic show cool people and a really cool atmosphere The food however sucks I got the BBQ salmon after the waitress recommended it to me Why I trusted her is still a mystery to me The salmon was bland and just barely edible No seasoning just fish with sauce slapped on it You could tell it wasn t even marinated The mac and cheese is the worst I ve tasted at a place that claims to make soul food There was not an ounce of soul in this stuff The collard greens were also the worst I ve had at a restaurant My fianc ordered the shrimp creole I sampled it and was unimpressed It had no taste whatsoever He claimed to enjoy it but i don t believe him Also had the peach cobbler which was actually ok Like I said earlier I liked Billie s because the music was nice and it s a cool place to go catch a show Just make sure you eat before you go The place is very expensive and I was still hungry when I left I didn t even finish my food because once I took a couple of bites of the mac and cheese and felt my stomach gurgle I knew I had to leave it alone It was made with a runny cheese that I knew was gonna wreak havoc on me later if I dared to finish it off I will definitely return to Billie s again for the music and the peach cobbler 
1eDbVoJs8ZWsj3HiEdW5Yw Columbia I love this place The food has never disappointed me I m slowly working my way through the menu plate by plate and nothing s been bad so far The prices are very goof for the quality of the food Service was fine to good The waiters are nice enough 
1esojTkX3n87L-qa1wW-lg Columbia Last night my friend and I met for dinner and were pleased to be seated inside 10 minutes at 7 30 pm on a Friday night I m so unbelievably happy to have a neighborhood restaurant that serves larb a delicious meat salad so close to home The dish was a tad bit too spicy but I think that s how larb is supposed to be served My friend enjoyed her dish and we celebrated our cheap bill 18 by buying numerous beers next door at the Amsterdam 106 It was a good night and we ll soon be back I look forward to trying the Thai iced tea 
1EYU9jzawVFjAB_LUzx_jQ Columbia While I was visiting the NBC Universal store in Rockefeller Center the doorman there tried to convince me that Tom s had closed recently and it wasn t worth my effort in trying to go there for lunch Boy am I glad I didn t listen to him there s no way such an iconic 90s symbol could just close like that Well my gut instinct was right and I came to Tom s Restaurant about a week ago for dinner I was glad I got to experience the restaurant even if the inside looks nothing like the Seinfeld show The menu had a little bit of everything Just like a grimey diner would Everything from hamburgers and french fries to a chicken or pork chop dinner plate covered with creamy canned gravy Not the highest quality but it definitely hits the spot in your stomach for a cheap meal in the city I opted for a fattening Hamburger french fries coke and some cheese straws to nibble on for an appetizer All of this for under 10 The famous Kramer painting was hanging on the wall and they sell Seinfeld Tom s tshirts for about 15 but we just decided to eat and run we didn t need the touristy stuff as well 
1ezQ2DZM-k_OHlUSMpwF8Q Columbia The only dumplings I consider good there are shrimp pork or chicken corn The others are so so That being said those two are quite good Aside from that the service is pretty bad if you sit down and absolutely horrible when you order a delivery They mixed up my order several times got addresses wrong and did not refund me even when they said they would I ended up disputing a charge on my credit card because I was fed up In short it s a good dumpling place for the area but save yourself grief and just call ahead and pick up and make sure your order is correct EDIT So I gave them one more star because honestly these are the best dumplings around Columbia if you stay away from the veggie or the mushroom ones Service hasn t changed much in the sense that it s basically nonexistent 
1F5urYYIxKJdl8GtkYO3ZA Columbia Delicious food wonderful atmosphere the owner and waitstaff are great Only problem is that it gets very crowded for dinner sometimes and they don t take reservations In my experience the pasta and appetizers are wayyy better than the fish and meat main courses Tomato based sauces are done extremely well They grow a lot of food nearby or on the premises and you can tell from the taste of the food Also they have an award for being a green restaurant whatever that means This place is great It will please anyone all around 
1FEhvRwcUSb4xHwxuRiD5A Columbia I came in hungry for lunch and was completely full and satisfied I ordered the lunch portion of tebsi cubes of beef with tomatoes jalapenos and berbere It was served with greens and another veggie side on injera The kitchen also sent out an extra side of injera The portion was perfect for me and my hungry tummy The restaurant was clean the waitress was quick and made sure my water was filled Thank goodness she brought me plenty of wet wipes before and after my meal GLUTEN FREE DINERS Injera is typically made from teff a gluten free grain I had no intolerant reaction after eating the injera at Massawa but if you are extremely sensitive perhaps check with the staff to make sure their injera is made without wheat as a filler 
1FHXgW4KYuq6Tx1suq2ulg Columbia Went here on Sunday morning around 9 30 to get breakfast In short it was a terrible experience The service was incredibly slow and the two omelets we ordered took over 35 minutes We were the only diners in the place and were virtually ignored the entire time While the prices were incredibly reasonable the actual food was sub par No only did we have trouble communicating with the waitress cook s attention simple requests seemed rrrreeeeaal difficult As in can you bring some jam or butter for the toast was being heard as can you build a full size replica of the Empire State Building from toothpicks The kicker When we asked for the bill we were just told the price No bill No receipt Perhaps good for other occasions but my advice is to avoid Moving forward I know I will 
1FKI_lixDt8ctgZoliSNrQ Columbia I ve never been to the South but this is the best BBQ i ve ever had that s low and slow not hot and fast that s grilling I got the combo platter of pulled pork and ribs The pork was gently broken up not pulverized I got to taste the different parts separately After I tasted the pulled pork I immediately wanted nothing to do with the ribs why d i get these dumb ribs but when I tasted the ribs I turned on the pulled pork this changing of allegiances continued throughout the meal each time i tasted the other THAT GOOD The collard greens had some smokey spice running through them that was delish the other sides were solid mac n cheese stewed okra potato salad the smothered fried chicken was good too fried chicken with gravy galore after we were stuffed and force feeding ourselves on taste alone there was enough left for almost 2 more meals to take home All for around 40 altogether NICE go here 
1FVSTWbEaXAOyKfrf68wmQ Columbia Great new neighborhood restaurant The space is amazing lots of room between tables and for guests Giant screen TVs for sports lovers Service was attentive Brunch menu is limited hold out for the dinner menu if you can Food was delicious better than expected Sure to return 
1fzRi7Im63u5zYOoJF3VsA Columbia I got the chicken and lamb over rice as per the yelp reviews and it was really good I do agree though after eating it my body felt like it was MSGed and needed to take a nap which was not good since I had work in the afternoon but nonetheless it was a good and cheap meal I asked for white sauce and bbq sauce and they were generous with both sauces but the bbq sauce definitely overpowered the white sauce so I recommend going with bbq since that s all you taste anyway The rice came with lettuce on the side which made the whole meal seem a little healthier although my stomach probably wouldn t agree I did notice that the lady in front of me got some fries and they didn t give me any Yes it s because I m jelly and that s why I didn t give them 5 stars 
1g3Jj3-H9FcjMuafekSlkQ Columbia I went to Columbia University this afternoon to have lunch with some individuals who work there and they took me to this hidden cafe style sandwich shop called Brad s It is next to the School of Journalism on the campus and is a pretty popular although unknown spot to some eatery on campus and cheap I ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich combo Toasted sub chips and fountain soda for 7 85 Goodbye Subway and you re 5 00 foot longs I have found my new favorite sandwich shop It s on the campus of Columbia so there is free wifi and plenty of people to spark up a conversation with reminded me of a sophisticated college hangout spot If you find yourself on the campus definitely stop by and have a sub DELISH 
1g8eIFiRYyDoktQTDlS27A Columbia The pizza is great but I m docking two stars because it is SO overpriced A 10 personal pizza is 19 bucks Wowzers 
1GdLKS5u2P4IgDmSSuFmxw Columbia This place was awesome I went here for Brunch and had the Catfish and Belgian Waffles The waffles were soft and tasty and the catfish is a Harlem treasure The waitress was great and the drinks were tasty Great neighborhood as well 
1geyzDI1bjGq0h776168Dw Columbia Loved it Inexpensive filling and delicious what more could you want from a place that measures smaller than most Manhattan apartments 
1gHOoQU_wWcXIEdx9qN95w Columbia The reason people are giving this bad ratings is because they don t understand the essence of Tom s Tom s is a place for locals looking for something to eat at one in the morning They are not trying to convince you that there food is anything beyond a simple diner but what you will find is a welcoming place that makes you feel at home I love Tom s simply for the interesting people and homey atmosphere My boyfriend and I go every Friday night and have formed a bond with the restaurant and staff 
1HJJanI54MZnYxJ5ZobIgA Columbia This Felafel place is Da Bomb PAY for the sauce even though you can get it for free at the bar becuase otherwise the bottom 2 halves of the felafel will be dry as dry toast Also sometimes your felafel might fall apart so grab a fork if your getting take out and if you are eating it there eat it over something One might question why if the above things are true why I give 4 stars Because it s cheap it s fast and it has more authentic options of stuffing then anywhere else 
1HwACFJGM3UB7wkYLGZsYg Columbia Excellent confit My girlfriend and I came here for valentines day dinner We had a reservation for 6 30 but due to a train mishap we got there 20 minutes late We were worried that we wouldn t get our table but they were extremely welcoming and seated us immediately The atmosphere is really great The decor was nice we liked the scarves on the ceiling The tables are all packed together which on one hand makes it cozy but you also do get quite a few tidbits of other people s conversations One of the only drawbacks was that the food takes a very very long time to arrive We waited over an hour However there is a reason for this they have one chef making all the food in a tiny kitchen That s one guy making food for some thirty or forty people So just be aware probably not the best place to go if you have somewhere to be right after or if you don t feel comfortable sitting and talking to your dinner companion s for hours at a time The food was awesome definitely worth the wait We thought the confit was definitely the best of what we ordered The sauces on everything were all really delicious the sauce on the escargots was especially good All together a great place great food just make sure you re prepared to wait a while for the food to come 
1hYIlEvyX6d8cAbwEhHxbw Columbia Weird experience here I went here with my parents on a weekday morning because Society Cafe across the street wasn t serving breakfast yet My parents who are much more restauranty than I am were really happy to find this place because it offered a traditional feel However this was far from a typical diner experience First of all we had serious language difficulties Everytime we ordered something the waitress would yell to the cook about something and then say they didn t have it They brought things we didn t order to our table but we re pretty easy going so we just ate it Anyway it was not bad but a little unusual 
1I5ZukYRsO-rv1KW3CALPQ Columbia I passed here this past Sunday 9 4 2011 and found the gate down Is this restaurant closed 
1IrPVPeOQOV52uvQJqOIjA Columbia You can t go wrong with an 8 filling lunch The pad sew ew is so filling and the noodle is so fresh My friends and I go when we want a cheap lunch and delicious lunch We went there today and will probably go again this weekend Shoot us 
1j3EFSy2JAA2vXsID28S9w Columbia A friend was in town for the weekend and we were looking for a good brunch place close by We searched for a place and decided on Deluxe Only had to wait 15 minutes for a table amazing on a Sunday at 1pm but once we were seated ordered coffee and a milkshake which didn t come for a good 15 minutes When we called the waitress over to ask if we could have our drinks she gave us attitude and then disappeared again The food was fine but the service will keep me from returning any time soon 
1j7-RqavXDhfPjgC_QlUSQ Columbia I stumbled upon this place as a fluke My friend and I were starving and walking from 136th toward 125th and after passing mostly only delis and fast food places we were relieved to see actual restaurants It s not a large place but the space is open and so well decorated and lit that I did not feel claustrophobic or uncomfortable The chairs were comfortable the atmosphere was nice and the host was extremely accommodating and polite We ordered the Bruschetta to start then we asked for the gnocchi sorrentina dish and the pollo marsala But before all of our food arrived we received a little bread basket with a dipping sauce The sauce was AMAZING It was tangy flavorful and paired perfectly with the fresh bread The Brushcetta arrived next That was also very tasty the seasoning the texture the taste None of that compares to the gnocchi I would have to say I am a gnocchi aficionado I love the stuff and eat it any chance I get and the Max Soha gnocchi is by far the best I have tasted EVER It was light and fluffy not overly doughy and didn t sink to the bottom of my stomach I could taste a hint of potato and the mozzarella pieces in the dish were milky and delicious I also had the pleasure of tasting my friend s Marsala dish and that was amazing too The potatoes were perfectly roasted and the reduction was delicious I would definitely recommend this place to anyone It was just perfect 
1j8hvomLMy5sF5QdaeCqNA Columbia We started by splitting the Tomato Salad appetizer 13 made up of big sesame roasted croutons and thick slices of local heirloom tomatoes marinated in oregano and sherry vinegar garnished with slices of red onion and jalape o morrocan olives and a handful of delicate sprouts It was delicious For my main course I ordered the Pan Seared Scallops 23 with leeks asparagus pearl onions and peas all sitting on a lovely drizzle of breakfast radish and asparagus coulis and garnished with fresh flat leaf parsley and little bit of dill The scallops were very well prepared seared perfectly on the outside and tender and juicy in the middle I really loved the slightly carmelized flavor of the roasted veggies especially the pearl onions Before we visited Vareli I had scanned a few Yelp reviews and knew that their Chocolate and Toffee Bananas dessert 7 was coming up big So to end the meal we decided to split this Man was it good This is the dessert to order at Vareli you don t even need to look at the menu The dense dark chocolate mousse nestled on a pool of delicious rich toffee banana pudding and slices of carmalized bananas dusted in chocolate slivers is divine 
1jKhkfjWvl--6tW0ouaY_Q Columbia Excellent food perfect for a date I ve been there 5 times and still loving the food 
1JtpDz3v2c63urLxUW9eWA Columbia Fun facts re Koronet s pizza 1 A regular slice 3 50 2 A to go slice will take up your entire hand and forearm as you walk down the street thus earning you stares and jealousy from everyone on the street as you skip back to your apartment 3 No person of relatively normal size and or weight can eat more than one of these 4 They steal soda cups napkins and even pizza boxes from nearby business or they re donated but come one does that actually happen Conclusion I love this place 
1K0igiyDinmAnbTRMjewOg Columbia I really like the people that work here For them I will visit again I had the ziti pasta which was really really good During a previous visit I had the chicken parm sandwich and it was so so The super convenient location for Columbia students along with the variety of food to pick from makes it a great choice for lunch between classes 
1KLENefOggeUQ-BIZthSJg Columbia Wonderful neighborhood cafe with yummy sandwiches and salads Incredible lattes and usually really really good iced tea depending on who s working The brunch is awesome try the pancakes or waffles Don t expect super fast food service when they re busy like on weekends cause there s just one cook But it s worth the wait to me Really good happy hour They recently added traditional Sangria to the menu too which is delicious and will definitely give you a buzz after one glass Love the vibe Music varies depending on who s working but I ve loved the mix of things every time I ve come except the one night when it was randomly all reggae all night One reggae song great two fine ten a bit much This is definitely a coffee bar sandwich place by day and a chill bar at night They aren t trying to be anything else and I like that they can wear both hats convincingly Love to Cafe Amrita P S The suggested credit card minimum is just 5 not 10 as someone else posted 
1kqzB2YeC5MKbRZMnq4omw Columbia Awesome soul food place While it s a little on the small side we got lucky and didn t have to wait long There was a growing line of people waiting as we dined though Service was smooth and friendly but kind of slow paced I m guessing they make the food in small batches so that may be why it takes a while or they just might be stuck in the southern mentality of taking it easy As long as you expect a bit of a wait you ll be fine My favorites were the smothered pork chop and the smothered chicken Both the pork and the chicken were moist and tasty and the gravy just made it even better I think I ended giving half away half my plate to allow for sampling and still had plenty The gravy was excellent Sides were also very good Collard greens mac and cheese candied yams green beans the only one I didn t really like was the mashed potatoes The texture made it seem like it had been sitting around for a while since it was a bit hard and crumbly rather than smooth Corn bread was kind of dry and not sweet but I think that s what Southern style corn bread is supposed to be like right I still prefer the cakey style corn bread Sharing an entree with someone getting the side platter dinner worked out really well share the huge entree and a smorgasbord of side dishes As typical of many soul food places there was way too much food and it was of greasy Even if the food wasn t good I think I would still be drawn here because of the cozy atmosphere and the awesome looking desserts Must try dessert 
1kRxlck6iCXLznxdm2StIQ Columbia As soul food is a great love of mine I was very happy to this place move in just up the street from me I have already had much love for the cuisine at Spoonbread and R S gave me another soulful option The ribs here are really fantastic They are meaty without being too fatty smokey and have that touch of burnt caramel goodness from the sauce The fried chicken was Yummmmy The skin was light and crisp with wonderful flavor The meat was juicy but not at all greasy I LOVE fried chicken and this was certainly up there with my favs I really liked their collard greens as well I like to pretend that they are the nutritious part of the meal and make eating all of this OK I ll need some more visits to fully review their menu and that makes my soul very happy 
1lcRBnmnreuKD6AhNzy60A Columbia I ventured out to Lido about a year or so ago when it first opened for brunch During that meal I remember that the restaurant was empty but the food was some of the best I ve had in my neighborhood I was puzzled why people were beating down the door However when I returned to Lido a year later for brunch it s clear that the word has spread The restaurant was packed and there was a great buzz in the atmosphere as waiters and waitresses scurried around from table to table and the bartenders mixed mimosas and Bloody Marys The brunch menu at Lido is nothing out of the ordinary omelets granola French toast sandwiches etc However the food is prepared with care and all of the dishes have a tremendous amount of flavor Between the three of us that were at brunch we ordered the following White Polenta mushroom ragu parmigiano reggiano poached eggs Omelet with Mushroom guanciale caramelized onion goat cheese Baked French Toast berries and cream Vermont maple syrup Side of Bacon Grilled Bread butter house made jam I had the white polenta all to myself and I was glad I wasn t sharing It was delicious Overall there was a lot of flavor packed into this small skillet The polenta was topped with mushrooms in a sweet sauce which was then topped with two poached eggs and a perfectly seasoned grilled piece of bread The yolks of the poached eggs ran into the other components of the dish and after shoveling down as much as possible with my fork the bread was a perfect way to soak up and enjoy the remaining sauce While I didn t have any of the omelet or baked French toast I will say that judging by my friend s expressions and the clean plates in front of them these dishes were also equally enjoyed The one complaint I do have is about the side of bacon I like my bacon extra crispy and unfortunately Lido doesn t seem to endorse this The bacon that we received was not crispy and dripping in fat I mean I understand that I m not eating the healthiest food item in the world but at least limiting the amount of fat I see dripping off of my food would be a nice consideration next time around 
1Lh1EWkx1oEq8YPH7W_6zg Columbia A very cozy place used to be my favorite for more than 4 years Unfortunately since then the quality of food has deteriorated to a rather average level and so did service especially in the past year A very very sad loss Their tiramisu is still holding and is indeed the local legend And that s why Pisticci gets 3 stars instead of 2 
1lOa20_j026AX16P3YKbAA Columbia Food The wings were very good they have two categories of wings sane and insane Within these two categories there are subcategories with increasing degrees of heat I only experienced the insane category and had the abusive and nuclear options There is one hotter option which I did not try but both abusive and nuclear were very good They were spicy but not painfully so although I think I have a fairly high threshold for heat Their boneless wings named chicken littles were disgusting they were lightly breaded which although healthier made them disturbingly chewy They also were visually awful Service The service here is not the greatest There is a counter to order food but if you want to eat in they apparently have a waiter There is no need for the waiter system You essentially tip for someone bringing you your wings at your table Decor Its a wings place so not much is expected It is very clean but also incredibly sterile I don t want wi fi computers in a place that I am eating Also there is no wood in the place everything is white and black Maybe it comes off better at night but I felt that I was eating in a hospital cafeteria 
1LU8CDK9HDp-oUnyx309Eg Columbia The one thing I love about NYC is that you can stumble on amazing places like Sip I was looking for a bar on a late night that had good music a chill vibe and good drinks Luckily I strolled by Sip with the bff because it was exactly what we were looking for The music was chill and eclectic tunes included records from Beyonce RadioHead Kanye West and my all time favorite classic 80s r b The drinks were delish I opted for a few glasses of the cheap red wine It s really called Cheap Red but its a good mix of a couple of reds It also didn t taste cheap at all and at 6 glass it was a great deal My friend had a cold and ordered a hot toddy this drink was the real deal Jameson lemon cloves honey and a tea pot of hot water to knock that Cold out The atmosphere was super chill I guess I would describe it as a hip coffeeshop type of vibe that happened to have a fully stocked bar I can t wait to come back for 1 Brunch with endless mimosas bloody marys 2 The late night happy hour 2 4am craziness and 3 1 2 off food on Mondays With all of these deals how can you not try this place 
1LyRKTMp5D4f8SSJ7FOXvA Columbia I absolutely love this place We ve been blown away by everything we have ordered thus far My wife and I typically walk from our home on 132nd St to the restaurant and back almost as a ritual on most weekends We are big fans of the following the tiger shrimp crepe the smoked salmon crepe the chocolate lovers crepe that we request with Nutella Belgium Milk Chocolate Creme Fresh and Strawberries the red mango smoothy From time to time I also get the scrambled eggs pancakes and home fries and then split the chocolate lovers crepe 
1Lyu6FpJ-lExwu7A-MBjAQ Columbia I came here for brunch a few Sundays ago and thought it was amazing The atmosphere was elegant and the croque madam was excellent I would definitely eat here again 
1lZMzKURRMVr4DKaOuN-Yg Columbia My one and only experience was awful the sashimi dinner pieces were so tiny that perhaps I should have brought a magnifying glass The ramen was also too soggy and over soaked 
1m9BhceAeGq5FulZBmlAdA Columbia Like everyone else the only reason you come here is because of the outside I ve eaten here 3 times all showing my out of town friends around and I probably won t eat here otherwise For all the tourists that come here I d expect the staff to be friendlier but I guess the owner I think he was the owner just wanted us up and out because we were taking our time chitchatting and people were waiting The food wasn t memorable as it was neither good nor bad However I have to dock a star because they screwed up 2 4 of our orders 
1n03Xy4qcIPtIDEAuxLDhw Columbia My cousin I met up here for dinner The food was good the service was good and the ambience was nice Their appetizer brown bread is very good I had a salad and ordered it without dressing It came with dressing which they kindly remade for me without a fuss My cousin had salmon and a cream sauce which he said was tasty Worth stopping in if you re in the neighborhood 
1n1_-ouz2tU6NtXJpwBKOg Columbia This is not an authentic korean restaurant Servers seem to be too busy most of the times 
1nFYhPhIk_uNNcls4LcXLw Columbia I love french food but these grand morningside restaurants are starting to all taste the same to me I could ve gone to deluxe across the street can t really distinguish at all But 3 stars for pretty consistently decent food the place to go if you get random french onion soup cravings like I do But other than that it s on the pricier side and not as good as Pink Pony downtown 
1ng3b842nquv_SDWeyqfcA Columbia I ve been here a couple times and tried a number of different entrees and daily specials They were all good but nothing that made me wanting to run back The prices were reasonable and the service mostly acceptable On one occasion a friend didn t like the dish he ordered I tasted it and agreed it was horrible and that he should send it back it was quite difficult to explain to the waiter that the food was no good and he wanted something else they did eventually understand and replace his meal I guess they handled it okay but it certainly wasn t like they were gushing with desire to satisfy 
1ng63mZgNetzpO0rp3yPmw Columbia I work nearby and I come here strictly for the salads Wait and flavored goat cheese But seriously 8 50 for unlimited toppings is exceptional I love the sound of next next next Sometimes I wanna put in things I don t like beets just because it s free fifty Love that ish 
1Nk-ifjRhwEWEDSvr6IeWg Columbia I d give it 4 stars but I gave it 5 because of their fall special Fall special get a beer and any burger is 5 happy hour beer on draft is 5 I go to toast often with friends to chill it is just a great place to hang out Low key good enough food friendly service dark Food and drinks their burgers are great side salad is just OK but their sweet potato fries have been consistently good Chicken fingers are good i think they make it with chicken tenderloin which makes them more tender and less dry But they are thinner the batter is not anything spectacular though My favorite sandwich is Mozz sundried tomatoes pepper roasted The cheese is slightly melted and the combination of the tomatoes and peppers is simply delicious I am all about finding what i like on the menu and having the option to choose There is a variety of beers on tap and of course happy hour is 5 Service typical NYC service friendly enough for me to return there all the time It is speedy but attentive Ambiance there are tvs at the bar but never really sat at the bar It is not that spacious but it s a casual relaxing place for friends to hang out and catch up I live near by so i have become a fan of this place but i would not go out of my way to visit this place if you are in the area take advantage of the fall special 
1NTHOkrTIiBm9oWnEgo7Zg Columbia Looks like the overcooked pork was a one time thing Their cubans are rather good but I still advise against ordering three half churros for 6 
1nWIYt0Le3mKIeUmVqxD0g Columbia A friend and I eat here on a week day evening The place was crowded but we were able to squeeze between other customers on the bench no tables benches We each had a falafel and an ice tea The food was tasty and fresh Kind of pricy 
1NWuIGgxhU6ayCeaBcy2Gw Columbia I came here for the first time last week and had a very good experience The falafel pita sandwich is really as good as it gets The salad bar is great because you can add as much as you want of various items I stuck with some tabouli salad cucumbers tomatoes and some tahini sauce Unfortunately the toppings only make it the first half of your sandwich leaving the bottom with just pita and falafel and some stray pieces of spinach I also thought the fries could be a little better since they advertise them as being a big part of what they do Could there be some improvements Yes Will I come back HELL YES I m looking forward to try their freshly squeezed juices I think next time I will skip the fries and get the juice instead 
1O2MrLxRMlG4qbDbdf4_1Q Columbia The best Mexican in NYC hands down I love this place It s a hole in the wall just a few tables inside and the grill is up front You can watch them make your food The food is cheap but really good and you get a LOT of it I am vegan so I usually stick to bean veggie or cactus taco they are sooo huge and really good Their rice is the bomb sticky and soft I always leave this place with leftovers and totally stuffed T 
1OAalH1MtrP_W2TYMn4zQA Columbia A peppered turkey sandwich with pesto mayo cucumbers tomatoes fresh cheddar from Milano Market is the way to my heart Freshest ingredients friendly staff and sandwich makers great location and perfect place to buy your specialty gourmet items 
1OEqzUH_lfYGkwUxc7vueA Columbia This is a fine market I go here regularly It is a little more expensive than I would like and the quality is just okay It s biggest plus is that it is located right at the top of the park right by the stops for the M3 and M4 Since that is the bus where I get off and walk to an apartment a few blocks away it is often a convenient option It is a full service large market There is fresh produce meats and poultry cheeses staples and ICE CREAM yum It is definitely a step up from Associated Markets but you pay for the difference 
1OhmoxalBU1lVKxTSX1XSw Columbia Do yourself a favor young underclassmen and make the trek across College Walk to Amsterdam HamDel s sandwiches may be a bit more expensive than its Broadway counterpart M2M but you can forgive yourself the extra dollar or two when you nosh into your new favorite sandwich For 6 50 plus tax you can have your pick of almost any of the giant monstrosities at HamDel I always always always get the Monica Lewinsky chicken cutlet tomato cheese and gravy on a hero It s seriously the perfect sandwich on toasted soft bread and I can eat it days in a row without getting tired of it My recommendations the Monica Lewinsky breakfast wraps and cheese fries The latter isn t actually that great but at 4AM the perks of a 24 hour deli after a night of bar hopping their cheese fries with gravy are probably the only thing your tastebuds will be able to detect Super fast friendly service And cheap 1 50 iced coffees with plenty of milk and sugar The only bummer is the credit card limit they re real strict about the 8 minimum 5 stars for a deli Generous slightly sentimental but deserved 
1oY-GYXYHovPc6U_uIq4Fg Columbia Tasty and fantastically affordable I had a special pasta with wild boar and artichokes for 11 I also really liked the music they were playing jimmy cliff toots the maytals even if it s not quite what you d expect in an Italian joint very pleasant atmosphere 
1OydCTUit9hm-9Dz-FJrmA Columbia This is the location used for the Seinfeld diner facade and makes for a great photo opp But the food was not that good Now I was not expecting a mind blowing meal but this diner really lacked I am a big diner fan it is one of the things that when done right make the NY diner experience great But there was just something lacking with the food I really wanted to love this location but felt a little let down by the grub Now the prices are not bad at all I mean I ordered a cheeseburger deluxe which was a big burger served with fries for under 5 So if you are broke want to take a picture of a famous diner and do not necessarily care about taste then this is the place for you But if you are looking for a great diner in NY skip this place 
1oYu2vJbVaU9X-qgBWOc2Q Columbia If you re a college student you probably love this place If you re not a college student you probably won t love the atmosphere The rooftop bar is cool but it s usually packed with twenty year old dudes trying to get drinks Their happy hour and late happy hour are good deals though and their burritos are decent thought not as good as Chipotle s down the street 
1Pbjfd5YgiQUKPri3Qv4cw Columbia We went last Tuesday after a most horrid experience at Moca This was a wonderful surprise and I don t even like beer The atmosphere was perfect for both genders Not frilly or to shi shi but nice clean lines that we ladies with style love The two bartenders I experienced were cute kind and attentive The shorter bartender with the raven tattoo was a little friendlier talkative than the other I had the Fruli and it was a delicious Strawberry beer They have Hofbrau ON TAP and plenty of bottled options to supplement I didn t see wine on the menu while I was there nor did I see food If they add those two it might end up being my new favorite bar Very calm ambience during the week I have to try it on the weekend 
1PeEBJe-d95z_yGhvVBj1A Columbia Liked this place Fun atmosphere nice location near Columbia to sit outside Had the daily fish special and it was good but not great Overall a good choice in an otherwise not so food fantastic area 
1PEPTH0to7TRxqs50ByFqA Columbia Eh Nothing spectacular to say about this place it s just your typical diner My boyfriend was excited to be eating in Seinfeld s diner but I just wanted a salad I was holding out some sweet potato fries I had spotted across the street Service was exceptionally quick however and as others have said make sure you bring cash as this place is cash only 
1Pk7g-jZdr3sLyz7bLZ0Fw Columbia I introduced some of my colleagues to the upper west side morningside heights by taking them to Havana Central The sangria was tasty my friends had the shiraz sangria and I had a glass of the port sangria I am big into port now delicious The food was also great We had the empanada sampler beef shrimp and chicken The chicken empanada was the best I wouldn t get the beef next time I had the shrimp in creamy garlic sauce with the white rice I think I gobbled this entree up in a span of 5 minutes However I wished that I had ordered the skirt steak that my friend had the right size portion and cooked perfectly as ordered medium rare Another friend had the cuban sandwich which he enjoyed with his sweet potatoe fries Our waitress was friendly and very attentive She also recommended my entree which worked out well The customers were mostly locals including Columbia students hanging out at the large bar area I have not been to the other Havana Central locations but I would definitely recommend this one 
1q1oOGn-9rbd2Apn_2PQFw Columbia So surprised that the reviews for Amir s are so low on yelp I ve been here a couple times for lunch with friends after class I usually get the falafel combo and it always comes out with just the right amount of crunch and flavor The fries are always hot and perfectly cooked Arguably at the level of many falafel places in Israel and better than many falafel places in this city i e Maoz Pita Joe s etc However the last time I went with my SO he was pretty underwhelmed by the chicken shawarma All in all a decent place run by nice people and pretty fairly priced good food even without the Columbia student discount 
1Qx5Ln94sdALK6KjZlOntA Columbia Really enjoyed this spot They had alot of different soups with different broths which is my love I think I tried three different soups and I really did like them all Seriously take some time and go through the menu as there are alot of options That being said if you re not that far uptown already or at Columbia I cant say I reccomend you making the trip but if you re in the hood Give it a shot Service sucks as mentioned 
1QzadH1c-c7MfiLM9OyBZQ Columbia Today I had the 2 item on the brunch menu The fishcakes were big tender and flavorful The scrambled eggs were fluffy and the home fries were cooked just enough with lots of peppers and onions I loved the lemonade too I hadn t eaten here in about two years so it was nice to come back I enjoyed a good meal with generous portions and the other people I ate brunch with loved their food as well catfish grits waffles home fries sausage eggs I look forward to trying their chicken waffles and other dishes 
1qZvcUI9urmQY5-PGvybNg Columbia We all have to face the truth most Mexican food in New York City is crap I would rather eat at Chipotle than your average fake Mexican spot which I ve done one time a little too in my cups and I needed food immediately This said I would ve gone to Taqueria y Fonda la Mexicana if it had been close by The place is small so if it s busy you may just have to wait I d say there are no frills but that s not true They bring you complimentary chips and salsa that are surprisingly good The food is between good and very good as well and actually reminds me of real Mexican food There are a number of reasonable vegetarian options and you ll leave full for likewise reasonable prices for NY definitely under 10 Were TFM located in another city it might not be my go to but on the Upper West Side it absolutely is Well worth stopping in 
1rhDmRCFH5Q0UzkXvcWgYw Columbia I just can t say anything bad about this place I just can t It s a little crowded Sure the wait can be long up to 15 min But your 10 brunch just can t get any better Can t It s really really hearty My eggs were so soft filled with potatoes and cheese all gooey warm and tasty My orange juice was fresh My toast and jam were just damn Our waiter was so frakking nice Decor was like sunshine I have no clue what these peeps are talking about 
1RIWk7RZFL40fcVzkpJYKg Columbia Fun place to go on a Friday night Has a DJ variety of different items on the menu Enjoyed the food as well as the drinks Would recommend the sangria Also love that they have a coat and bag check as well 
1rJB2mFfqqtnYs31UCOvYg Columbia Don t get confused kids Cafe Addis is NOT a restaurant I get the feeling that the sandwiches are served pretty much only in case of emergency If a bar patron is getting bombed they can stuff a sandwich down his throat to absorb the alcohol So unless you re bombed don t bother with the food But if you re there to get bombed or jittery you re in the right place It s a clean friendly Ethiopian owned place that serves a decent shot of espresso Underrated spot for a quiet happy hour drink or a quick coffee or to catch some good live music 
1ro4lO79oxNlqw8foniEQA Columbia I am kind of surprised how poor the reviews are for Amir s Don t get me wrong it s definitely an average falafel place but at a price of 3 50 near Columbia I don t have too much to complain about The tahini sauce was fine pickles and vegetables were fine The falafel was kind of greasy with less taste than you might expect but still a decent falafel Most people are exaggerating on these reviews I have been to some of the best falafel shops in NYC Mamoun s Maoz etc and Amir s is a nice cheap alternative if you live in the Morningside Heights neighborhood 
1rsaQp_YTAwogu7V7sFjLQ Columbia This place has the best straight up classic NYC Chinese food in the neighborhood Nothing particularly fantastic but they are quite courteous and delivery is shockingly fast 
1Rtlbwp4R-PoCzBKP_cF6g Columbia Oh Pisticci how I love you I love that you re certified green I love that the waitstaff is unbelievably friendly and simultaneously professional even on nights where there s an hour wait I love how delicious and homey everything tastes here I love that your dessert menu is as good as your dinner menu I love that delicious pomegranate cocktail invention the bartender made me while I was waiting for a table with my friends This is probably my favorite restaurant in the area A lot of people compare it to Max SoHa and while I feel that the latter establishment has a few standout dishes Pisticci knocks it out of the park Well at least to the periphery of the park And I say that because the dishes at Pisticci are more interesting than the ones at Max SoHa and also they re more consistently good But enough comparison I want to talk about Pisticci and why it rocks in and of itself As I mentioned the staff is great They re professional they know what they re doing but they re always super nice It actually seems like a really fun place to work The bartenders are good and one of them made me this really yummy pomegranate cocktail that I can t wait to have the next time I go there The food is so delicious I do have my favorites the maltagliati with ricotta spinach and lamb is an important one and their fresh ravioli is an important one but their specials are also always fantastic I like the wines that they have available by the glass There can be a long wait especially on a Friday or Saturday night but you just have to come expecting that and be patient If you decide it s worth the wait you won t be disappointed It also helps that while you re waiting the hostess is always really nice and gives frequent updates about when your table will be ready The ambiance which I ve not mentioned yet but will mention now is also beyond reproach This place is cutesy without going overboard and the lights are just dim enough so that you could come here on a date or with a buddy It pulls off the cheesy when used elsewhere library themed wallpaper rather well I really miss Pisticci now that I ve moved back to California but when I return to NY in the fall it s one of the first places I ll go 
1RUx9jFXkqkbCSHvBAPmJA Columbia The decor is what sold me I was treated to dinner here after working on a shoot and we were STARVING We had the empanadas which were ok but you know in NY you can find a beef patty anywhere but I digress I had some concoction to drink I like my drinks a little sweeter but it had me relaxed We both had the skirt steak garlic fries and salad and it was pretty good The salad had a really good light dressing on it I think it was balsamic it was tangy The fries were great I love papas fritas The steak was good too it was a little crunchy on the outter layer but it was still good The restaurant had a great vibe people were dancing Frankie Beverly and Maze was pumping in the background They have a lot of daily specials and a late night happy hour I will definitely be back 
1RyRAQWDbuQvjw2Z7e3X_w Columbia Title Me Belly Full of Cheese Grits The bottom line I departed w a BELLY FULL OF CHEESE GRITS That was bout the only thing that I enjoyed My bisuits were BLAH BURNT cooked too long bacon quality was no comment and the red potatoes did nothing for me either Also the tabletops made out of old doors covered w glass I think are quite unique but a bad choice if you can t thoroughly clean out the cracks crevices as the table I was seated at was full of crumbs EEK 2 stars for the overall meal 4 stars for the grits For me it was a disappointing 1st brefass in NYC And to think a staffperson at our hotel had recommended the place the day before our first day in town but we decided to go somewhere else I would have been pissed if this had been my first meal in town 
1S2cpP-GzeTTyhVXCVSxVg Columbia After leaving Latitiude this place felt like a library in comparison even though it was packed with neo Harlemites I power chugged a few Six Point Sweet Actions and didn t even get my bartender s names I did speak I remember that But the fraternal handshakes and slice of life conversations were elsewhere The woman sitting to my right got up and stared at me as if I was a stalker from a great thriller movie I almost spit in her eye I could not place the downtempo background music It is in the n hood so I guess that I will try them again but i think I hang over at Chocolat or Mocha more So I can feel the n hood I wanted to make sure that my drunk behind was somewhat clear about my review so I went back after typing this I met a couple of gents who were into social justice and metaphysical elitism from Texas who wanted to holla at some Puerto Rican hotties from the Bronx They were talking their validating stuff to me while some manipulating opportunist was trying his mack hand on the ladies Typical bar stuff The moral of the story is go early and be a story in the lines of CBS How I met your Mother or come late be a segment in As the World Turns It is up to you 
1s7C6ufNNbHomwYupsaoMg Columbia If a friend hadn t recommended and accompanied me to Taqueria I probably would have walked past it saying that place look gross I m glad i went and now know how excellent and authentic is really is The main area of the restaurant is very small only about 6 or 7 tables but apparently we found out afterward that there is another part of the restaurant next door were there are at least 15 other tables The wait staff is very friendly and greeted us quickly so I could order a negra modelo for only 4 sweet They brought by some fresh chips and 3 different salsas Each were tasty and very fresh I had a hard time deciding what to order Part of me wanted the beef tongue and pig ear tacos but I ll save that for next time They have a lot of dishes that aren t on your average texmex or Americanized Mexican restaurant What intrigued me was the Alambres which comes with veggies your choice of meant guacamole and tortillas underneath I picked pork strips and chicken as my meats The meat was excellent cooked nicely and the pork was not tough The chicken was nicely marinated and had a nice spice blend to give it a bit of kick I had the pleasure of trying the veggie and chicken tamale which both were excellent moist and the veggie had tomatoes in the center I also tasted one of the GIANT burritos And they are freaking giant and easily two meals for the low price of 8 25 for veggie and 9 25 for meat This place will never win any awards for ambiance or style but they serve great food use tasty fresh ingredients and no stuffy feeling This place apparently doesn t have the same greatness for delivery but I will be getting take out again and again 
1SFg3YfBhblLc41xBsGxVg Columbia Decent brunch spot 
1SK8pOx8Px9H8hb9NJdrhQ Columbia My fiance s burger was way under cooked We had to put it on the stove top for an extra few minutes to make it not pink My turkey burger was pretty decent I think they put scallions in it too which gave it a slightly different better than just turkey flavor The atomic fries are truly atomic in appearance They re tasty but a little out of control 
1spzXVg8fqtOnU9WOEhP7A Columbia Is it wrong that the cuisine of a country where so many people are starving tastes so delicious Had a great experience here with a couple of girl friends I think it would also be great for a date and a good test to see if they re down enough to eat with their hands The honey wine was excellent a real wake up on the taste buds The various dishes on the vegetarian platter are all flavorful and have distinct tastes Note the atmosphere is upscale but the prices are very reasonable 
1StOgcIvd1YQG7uJM5J0ow Columbia Good selection prices are eh 
1SxHw8F2E0kzalcgttM4vQ Columbia Really wonderful gem of a restaurant very charming Old World feel to it Sort of feels like you re inside a big barrel in a good way Really enjoyed the Hudson Valley duck perfectly tender and very flavorful Our waiter was also very kind of letting us have a little wine tasting of sorts b c we couldn t decide which wine we wanted 
1SYwgcJt9XJMKzHZUluhuw Columbia I would really give Max Cafe 3 1 2 stars but that wasn t an option and I honestly couldn t give them 4 stars Max Cafe is a cool relaxing chill place to go and have a coffee other hot beverage or glass of wine The crostini s are amazing The sandwiches are not so great at all read don t come here for the food if you are hungry The Cafe is very dark so don t come here to study or read in the evening It is a cool place to hang out and talk with friends a very relaxed atmosphere The chairs are funky and old and cool looking though not very comfortable They also have a 10 minimum to use a credit card which isn t always convenient 
1T0hNQFk3cWtbRA2rX8aHw Columbia Perhaps the food here is better than their coffee All I can say is that I know what I saw and tasted and that was Espresso In prepackaged little packets Put through the espresso puller OMG the horror Cafe au laits that tasted vaguely like coffee but much much more watered down It also tastes like it s been there for a while I m sipping it now and pulling a face every time Surly baristas Boo Yes the place was cheap and I am awake aren t I A little better than Starbucks but not by much Sad The search for coffee in Morningside Heights continues 
1T5200i6iYEdtD2BTFIUVQ Columbia Good place to take friends eat the smoked wings watch the game for and enjoy the patio 
1Tjflx42PLgGxGP1sCaCGg Columbia Bleh it helps a whole hell of a lot if you aren t getting delivery AND you speak fluent chinese not because they don t understand English but because their disservice towards non Chinese speakers sometimes borders on racism Weak Delivery radius is huge because the guys are on vespas great for those living in both East and West Harlem and wanting non yellow rice and authentic soups over ghetto fab Chinese food but it is slow as hell Plus the drivers can be downright rude if you don t leave what they feel is a high enough tip 20 at least One driver tried to push his way into our apartment when he felt the tip wasn t high enough to which my roommate responded by slamming the door in his face Ridiculous Only a few pluses the fried rice comes with edamame and is a huge portion they deliver bubble tea in sealed containers that last the trip and the menu is extensive Other reviewers are exactly right on the college pop keeping this place open it needs to just fade away At least the Ollie s at Lincoln Center though also rude has better food Lame lame lame Don t go 
1tSRwdowSITOPHkJThkBvQ Columbia My sister and brother in law live a short walk away from 107 West so we decided to hit it up for my sister s birthday dinner We ate dinner here on a Sunday evening and there was no wait time for our party of four We were seated by a ceiling to floor waterfall thing that had me totally entranced for the first few minutes Honestly I don t remember if the rest of the restaurant was well decorated mainly because I was so fascinated by the waterfall The menu was interesting In most places I d laugh at the menu and say there s no way it could ever work However this is New York City we re talking about An American Asian Mexican menu with a New Orleans twist works in New York City Sushi fajitas burgers and jambalaya on the same menu I had the blacken Mississippi catfish with roasted new potatoes THE BOMB I tell you It was SO good The roasted red pepper chipotle sauce was awesome We were all completely satisfied with our appetizer and entrees but the real highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the mocha mud pie I ve had some world class desserts in my days thanks to many trips to the legendary Harry Waugh Dessert Room in Tampa and I think that this dessert tops my list of best desserts ever Service wasn t quite on par with what would be expected of a restaurant of this caliber this is the only reason that I am not giving five stars After our table was cleared we waited at least twenty minutes until I finally had to request our check 107 West has great food and even better dessert I can t wait to go back for another delicious slice of mocha mud pie 
1tzTH1ZeYZA3bMIwJavhCQ Columbia I love everything about maoz Fresh delicious falafel freshly baked bread amazing crunchy fries regular and sweet potato and a fantastic salad bar Eat in so you can really fill up at the salad and topping bar everything is delicious especially yogurt and garlic sauces Worth the price still under 10 I have been to several locations and I am never disappointed 
1uDHEYCZTFY_lwFd45fo1Q Columbia Plantains good but a tad too sweet Vegetarian stuffed bell pepper VERY GOOD I think they added white pepper or something but the spice was great and the flavors were addicting 
1uJkGRt5sy3PGV9_5xgtGg Columbia Delicious food I m a big fan of Awash and Ethiopian food I love to get the Veggie Combination The green beans and carrots simmered with garlic is my favorite dish At dinnertime each table usually has a lit candle and rose making a nice atmosphere for a date 
1UZsXeCDHd83wNbGKvnOeQ Columbia Service was OK but I wasn t crazy about the food 
1U_8gqi8PEWr2kMvJalpSA Columbia I ve loved Melba s ever since we moved to the neighborhood 4 years ago when it was the only decent restaurant in the area now it s practically restaurant row I attempt to get something different every time but usually end up with the mac and cheese with a side of collard greens really terrific and red cake for dessert With a Guiness and coffee after it is pure comfort food Everyone is always very nice but service can be spotty really depends on who you get as a server and the noise level can sometimes be almost deafening Still the amazing food keeps me coming back for more 
1vnlLUEntvRP2gySARltAQ Columbia I popped in here after lunch one day and I have to say that I was happy Why was I happy you ask Well basically they sell English sweets aka English candy As someone who grew up in London I prefer English Chocolate to American and always buy English brand chocolate when I see it is available While they don t have a huge selection the did have Smarties Yorkie Bars and some others and so I was happy They also had some fresh french bread and a good selection of cheeses While there is no way that Milano could replace a grocery store for any of your needs they do have some items that are must haves and can t really be found anywhere else near the Columbia campus 
1VQRTGpuuxpgTMFi_6c70A Columbia Great brunch love the BLT and baked egg dishes Worth checking out for sure 
1VvnRUKHPPPCQWIvk1xoAw Columbia Pretty average neighborhood grocery store I did accidently buy moldy fontina cheese here when I first moved to New York I took Publix Supermarkets for granted So just make sure you check your perishables before you check out 
1VWP3yhNio1LUNtiRqkVxQ Columbia Tacos are delish but a little pricey although not by UWS standards Good beer choices 
1vxqS0TYXJlreW7h8J5Hug Columbia by far the best hamburger ive ever had in my life thus far the staff was so cool friendly and down to earth i walked in and felt like i knew them forever and im not even one of those women who thinks of gay people as cute accessories oh yeah its a gay or gay friendly spot either way the hamburger the catfish burger according to my boo because im allergic to fish the sweet potato fries the wild rice and the garlic string beans were off the dam hook the drink called Billie s Black is excellent i think i might have found my new addiction yeah it was THAT good lol no exaggeration i thoroughly enjoyed my visit there 
1W15t2Ug_bGf3dquU6Cn0Q Columbia Great omelet s Get the Spinach with turkey bacon 
1WnphrWd6Sf6fZh8etWEpg Columbia Sooooooooo good I dream about their veggie plate Cash only though Who has cash on them ever in NYC 
1wo4L6apLDzRwfWe_8n_HQ Columbia Argh my first pizza experience since moving to New York was horrible When I came at a reasonable hour last night a week night they had run out of the Sicilian and every other kind of pizza except for the Jumbo Now the slices are huge and almost impossible to eat without burning yourself and or spilling grease on everything and the prices are also pretty high So I got a jumbo pepperoni with peppers which turned out to be fresh bell peppers not pepperoncinis or roasted bell peppers so yuck The service is pretty careless and the dining area was unbearably hot at 9 pm Needless to say I m pretty amped for my first REAL New York pizza The Columbia Spectator said it best almost inedible sober 
1WOscEfdQECvfYyiUURn0g Columbia Expensive but the selection makes up for that Being able to get a 2 liter of plain green tea makes a big difference It s shockingly difficult to find just tea leaves brewed in water no aspartame no sugar Just leaves in water A little vitamin C is ok And you can get that here The sushi s alright not great If you re looking for fish on the go go for it But if you re looking for the real deal go to Ichie Japanese Restaurant The layout of the store itself is crowded This is a benefit in that it increases the available supplies It s a problem in that if there s more than five people in the store it gets difficult to get around The front desk service is prompt fast even if a little brusque They ll get you paid and out the door fast as with their space restrictions they can t afford to have a line build up And it is open very late as Morning 2 Midnite implies 
1wpT1cZ-OkVY-El85xuZpg Columbia Seriously I loveeeee this place Like many I live in the upper upper west side aka Harlem and don t have a ton of great eateries nearby This place is so yummy so affordable roughly 10 12 dollars an entree and their bakery is so exceptional A good friend of mine is obsessed with the color pink so for her birthday Kitchenette Uptown made a red velvet cake and dyed the entire thing pink for us at no additional cost It was a salmony pink with neon green letters and soo retro and festive Also it was delicious and moist The price wasn t bad either for such quality Fed 25 30 people and was only 70 dollars Will be back VERY soon 
1wxAtYFfl4PDmdcxc_VLnQ Columbia Crepes are little pillows stuffed with different versions of love Each crepe is special in it s own right Crepes on Columbus seems to fully understand this concept We came in on the evening of the most recent heatwave There was only one other couple seated in the restaurant The waitress was polite and the food came out promptly My guy ordered the grilled chicken basil creme spinach and mushroom crepe while I opted for a sweet crepe with Belgian milk chocolate marshmallow and strawberries Both were freaking delicious This will definitely be a regular spot for me You get two medium sized crepes with each order 2 crepe dishes 1 beer and 1 glass of house wine for 30 Yeah those are the kind of numbers that I like Some people call the neighborhood sketchy To those people I say take a walk around Hunts Point 3 in the morning and then redefine your meaning of sketchy Until then quit your whining it s practically down the block from Columbia not in a freaking war zone 
1WzqnfZ11mtegBWvXEWRVw Columbia Dear Koronets Thank you for feeding me with your brontosaurus sized pieces of cheesy and oily goodness when I was hungry broke and unable to ask my mother for more money because I blew it all on alcohol Thank you for serving me with your unwavering nonchalance no matter how astoundingly drunk I staggered into your establishment and or incoherently stammered out an order Thank you for not being ridiculously delicious so that I don t crave your I don t even want to know how many calories slices when I m sober Thank you for being open late so that I can visit you whenever I m stressed out from finals and or shamefully inebriated and hungry Thank you for your shady interior awful florescent lighting and mirrors on the wall that constantly remind me that I am drunk instead of studying Thank you for being so cheap Thank you for your small selection of drinks so that I can concentrate on your how in the world does that fit into my stomache sized pieces Thank you for not laughing or taking pictures for blackmail uses of my drunk college self With gratitude and with much love Columbia student 
1Xcem4h9hkIS73zJhAf_7A Columbia Maybe this is not a great place to go during the winter when the actual Terrace is closed and full of snow also there was a private dinner party of bankers or Columbia professor types that was occupying the best real estate in the indoor part of the restaurant So we had to settle for a night time view of the George Washington bridge as opposed to the more desirable midtown Manhattan view Actually the daytime view is probably better than the night time view if you are constrained to the GW bridge side as there s not many light there At any rate the food on the restaurant week menu was limited but delicious The decor of the restaurant had an old charm to it but it was borderline upstate NY hotel lobby restaurant feel The fireplace was definitely a winner but is only viewable to patrons of the bar The place was kinda hard to commute to either walk through Columbia or the Park In general I thought it was not worth all the effort to schlep from the downtown Manhattan 
1XCnQbbeW-1D-4sQQQeLIQ Columbia I guess we had far better service than most of the previous reviewers Our food was brought out to us rather quickly and our waiter was very nice it was my cousin s birthday so we had purchased Crumbs cupcakes for him and that s what he wanted for dessert the waiter brought him a glass of milk on the house I ordered the turkey burger and it was fantastic easily the best turkey burger I ve ever eaten It was moist and had fresh mozzarella melted on it with marinara sauce My husband had the penne and he said it was okay My aunt had the roasted chicken and mashed potatoes and raved about it My cousin at the steak frites and made it disappear rather quickly he said it was cooked perfectly The prices were also very reasonable I d go back 
1XhKSgfNqRz7OMD99vJd5Q Columbia Clueless wait staff specials confused We ordered a special a half lobster on capelini and decided on the salad as a side It came minus the pasta When asked why the confused waitperson claimed the salad was the substitute not so but we let it ride My dish shrimp and scallops was totally ill conceived they wrapped the skinny little shrimp around the scallops Do they know that scallops take longer than shrimp to cook I guess not The shrimp were overcooked and the scallops were mushy and undercooked all covered in a goppy breading that turned to an uncooked batter Never again 
1YizU0HKFogXbh6313CDjQ Columbia Brunch review Ok here s my advice Whatever you do whatever you order you MUST have a whole wheat biscuit with jam Oh the jam is divine It s perfectly balanced sweet tart and chunky complete raspberry perfection Put it on the warm biscuit which is tender on the inside with just the right amount of crunchy on the outside Believe it I m totally obsessed with the biscuits and jam So YUM Otherwise everything else was good My eggs were cooked the way I asked thought they were a little under seasoned no biggie that s why there s salt on the table right Hubby had the BELT sandwich and gobbled it up Oh and BTW Kudos Community for serving breakfast on weekdays until 11 30 
1yNvJlogvEeeivLnVcDRAw Columbia Ugh No Too much hype I ve been here for breakfast and dinner and while the breakfast was okay I felt absolutely jipped by the dinner It wasn t that good tasted pretty uncooked and I paid too much for it The communal table idea is an interesting one but it s always too crowded too loud and the service isn t stellar in the least It s a shame because the concept is great but I dislike places that gleefully proclaim themselves organic and then overdo it in the pricing and evidently low cooking temperatures 
1YtJutye4NYgfaBQwI4AWg Columbia This is a great local coffee shop My girlfriend lives very close and this is our unofficial breakfast spot It really keeps a cozy vibe and in the summer there is a group of 20 people who bing their dogs over after a walk in the park and share coffee This group of local dog lovers is open to other dog lovers coming to say hi The coffee is great and I like how they give you a cup and let you fill it yourself I usually fill 85 with either house blend or super z and then top it off with a little hazelnut I also like that they have a punch card that are just kept in a rolodex on the counter 10 ten coffees and your next one is free it makes the shop feel authentic and home grown One thing that knocks it down to a 4star for me is that they sometimes run out of either bagels or chive cream cheese They do have great other options but sometimes you get out of bed on the weekend and have your mind set on something specific just me I would definitely suggest stopping by if you live close Become a regular and grab a card 
1zD0x3DV__MOn31nDdtwhg Columbia Seriously the best Chimichanga I ve ever had Had the Chorizo and it was perfect and huge The salsa was a little disappointing but I m definitely going back to try their other entrees Oh and the margaritas were also perfect One was enough to keep me flying through dinner and on the walk back home 
1zE05L37CEmCZDG414yHzA Columbia The food I ve had better but I ve also had worse they had spirited milkshakes that I love mix it up really well The staff was amazing I went with a group of about 25 people and the waiter managed to get everyone s order correct and in a timely matter Whenever we needed something it was on the table in a matter of minutes Will I be back Maybe But probably just for their alcoholic milkshakes 
1zE2eXzJHcOmFkBTsHLM5g Columbia authentic hole in the wall feel reasonable prices gives chips and salsa only legit mexican place so far in the morningside heights columbia area that I feel safe walking to i ate the rolled tacos taquitos and carne asada taco both were up to par i m from southern california so I know what authentic mexican food tastes like 
1zwzu_ptVIajEQ5ZKjXjRQ Columbia This place is fantastic for desserts Just take a look at that drool worthy display case and you ll be raring to grab a fork and start nibbling away at anyone of their decadent treats There s not too much to the seating area here but you can enjoy some good coffee or Mighty Leaf tea with your treat I selected the chocolate profiterole which was equally as good as it looked Fresh fruit on top cut the richness of the chocolate The mini cheesecakes look pretty but weren t as delicious as the profiterole Full cakes and treats are available for takeout too We ordered another chocolaty cake to bring home and I enjoyed a piece of that the next day 
1zX4NcWOeyvtb3CAuYWTtA Columbia Date Time Crowd Sunday Evening Busy but no wait being seated First Impression Nice Clean almost Parisian Decor Modern We got word that seating upstairs was nice The Good The Food This was double date Birthday Dinner Double use of Groupon For Entree and bottle of wine We ordered the APPS Grilled Octopus Which from what I was told was tender and delicious I dont eat seafood Beef Tartare Tasty especially with the toast given ENTREES Duck 2 ways I remember how amazed I was by the Peach that accompanied it Bravo The leg confit was also very nice The Steak Well Executed and well seasoned The roasted cooked and seasoned perfectly The Pockchops Double cut cooked medium medium rare I enjoyed it although they should have asked how we wanted to meat cooked Dessert Creme Brulee Done correctly i love creme brulee Need a bit more caramelized sugar Chocolate Cake Rich Moist you need some milk with it We also had a bottle of the Cali Cab and the German Riesling both were very good The velvety tannins and fruit forward aroma of the cab was memorable The Bad Service was good not great Seemed a little sketchy with food and wine IQ No Complimentary B day dessert guess was expecting a little something And without Groupon can be a bit pricey Also Parking is a pain in the butt around here try parking by Riverside Park and walk a few blocks Reason to Comeback Plenty reasons to come back but a bit pricey and out of the way for this Queens native 
1ZzUBK4TIO479sdpmlEgxg Columbia This is the kind of bar the residents of trendy West Harlem have been waiting patiently for A laid back venue with a minimalist decor and a diverse delicious beer selection The food is tasty with a lot of small dishes The staff are friendly and pleasant and the owners remember your name A perfect meeting spot for afterwork mid week and brunch afternoon Can get really busy on weekend nights 
2-jCpRPpPhhk77M8gRII9Q Columbia We had dinner at the Thai Market last night and it was fantastic as usual We had one of the specials a braised beef in massaman curry which was incredible A recommendation is to always try their specials We also had our usual grilled salmon on spinach with curry rice and the grilled chicken with sticky rice and both dishes were perfect The deserts are also wonderful especially the mango with sticky rice Great food and excellent service 
208m0hSzlDcjILc0dSR9mA Columbia I am not a dumpling connoisseur but I think this adorable little dumpling restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood Just went hear for lunch and shared the following 1 steamed vegetable dumplings these were probably the least flavored of all 3 but had a nice ginger taste and fresh ingredients 2 steamed chicken with basil DELICIOUS superbly flavored and fresh loved 3 pan fried pork with cabbage i didn t see any cabbage in here but the pork was really good very juicy great quality pork Dumplings are LARGE they don t scrimp on size Since i don t usually eat dumplings even though they are expensive comparatively to others i thought it was a super cheap meal so win win for me Also i ate in and the restaurant is very clean and tastefully decorated 
20G4J1Ok1pQfNQoWhvKBiQ Columbia Okay this is food for when you re extremely hungry and you re ready to eat massive amounts of whatever So don t come if you re on a ridiculous diet or if you want something extremely healthy The portions are very large and the prices were reasonable Service is great 
20V9uBx8STzbJ29m1LMYiA Columbia You know it s not the best Their sushi s all right their lunch specials are pretty good yet I order from here all the time Why I love bubble tea with a deep and abiding passion and this is the only place on the UWS I ve found that will deliver it And it s good too well made with the heat sealed top Everything else I order is just filler to make the delivery minimum They re currently closed for renovations How long will I have to walk 9 whole blocks to the Columbia student center to get the bubble tea I crave 
21kVJCPC48pAE70b3p8_4Q Columbia I ordered one slice of just plain cheese This pizza left a film of grease on my teeth I had to brush my teeth just to get the grease off I didn t finish the slice It had no flavor and was just a bad tasting pizza Not recommended at all 
21mVxEVvcIfgFw2ovi75aQ Columbia Food isn t anything special Selection of draft beer is good It s only worth going for the happy hour 
22v8q0RstEe0p6XfovGY6g Columbia Rack Soul was just alright for me dawg I had a craving for some comfort food to fill both my stomach and the empty hole in my working man s ennui suffering soul The fried chicken with a side of mac cheese and side of collard greens filled my stomach alright but it wasn t very satisfying The first clue that dinner would be disappointing is when our order my special lady friend ordered the pulled pork po boy came out nearly immediately after we placed it Sure I appreciate fast service but I also expect my food to be cooked after I order it instead of being taken off a hot or more accurately lukewarm plate in the back And as I feared everything sort of tasted like it was last night s leftovers While I wasn t physically hungry when I left my craving hadn t been anywhere near fulfilled 
231DovwiSZiQcdN7GCezNw Columbia I was looking for a place close that made good buffalo wings I think I found one although I m not sold Toast was definitely kid friendly and the service was good the beer was cold but the wings were just aiiight They hit the spot but I ll have to go again and give them one more shot Hey the atmosphere is fine and the menu is pretty tantalizing sooo I ll go back 
23Dcd-U1AVEFe6X0PO2zCg Columbia I love society coffee I thought I d put my vote in because I don t agree with its current three and a half star average The people here are nice and you don t ever feel rushed I have never been to weekend brunch I have been a regular during the week If a friend visited me though I would not hesitate to bring them here at any time 
23tjsn804TrrE5N9Up1dEA Columbia When I was a young lad of about 18 I came up to New York from the deep south hoping for new cultures and friendships Although my wish for new cultures and friendships was granted I found myself often homesick and craving some good ole southern cookin One day another southern friend and I happened upon M G s Diner It s your typical NY hole in the wall diner that s been around for years I didn t expect much but after having the smothered pork chops with a side of sweet corn and collard greens I was actually satisfied gasp It s a great neighborhood joint You may have even seen it featured in such movies as Belly or Sugar Hill 
23VFRF3QXcXAk8TP4_15Aw Columbia Love the burritos 
23Y8qbgeK9evi-YSc0AXtw Columbia We wanted a restaurant on the UWS because we were going to St John the Divine s Winter Solstice concert This was three blocks away The rating is A We were three ladies among a crowd of young people probably many are students The atmosphere was cheerful The restaurant clean looking The waitress and waiter were wonderful and someone always kept my water glass filled The food We shared the chicken satay and spring rolls each serving consists of three as an appetizer They were excellent I m afraid not much experimenting with the food I had my usual Pad Thai w shrimp and it was just the way I like it They had Pad Thai one vegetable and the other like me with shrimp l 50 extra their prices were so reasonable My friend had Chardonnay and the other person had a red wine They both were happy with their choices I had none I m the driver They have regular coffee and two of us had that and it was definitely good They gave us the dessert menu but we were too full But they had a creme brulle type fried ice cream oy gosh can t remember the rest The place is definitely worth going to Our bill 65 00 
24fUZ0wbHMHQis7xS-RZeA Columbia Deluxe is practically on my campus so I ve been here more than once They have great brunch breakfast This past weekend I went with a couple people and I ordered the Huevos Rancheros it was pretty good though I could have used a bit more salsa I ve also had a burger and their fish and chips It was all really yummy I d definitely suggest it for brunch or lunch in the Morningside Heights area It s good portions and tasty food at a fair price They do get crowded during lunchtime and dinnertime no matter what day because of all the students and faculty stopping in for a quick bite 
257c_TfZ-2bqZ6kuWc0oHw Columbia 4 stars because it s the only Korean on the UWS and it fills the need for the occasional tasty hot pot 3 stars otherwise Food is good but service is rushed and not too friendly 
285B4rVNIdMye1yYuQC7UA Columbia Tasty tortilla soup blankets for protection from the chilly night air and guac with a healthy zip of garlic Woo hoo I can t wait to go back Lots of yelp complaints about the service but luckily that wasn t the case for us despite the fact that we dined on a busy Friday night Fab menu a nice mix of entrees and sides and smaller plates Great for someone like me who wants to try everything The food was beautifully presented my tortilla soup looked like a work of art topped with a giant pepper and sprinkled with cheese Corn on the cob drizzled with cheese and spices Adorable little gorditas filled with tender pork My friend and I stuffed ourselves to the point of embarrassment all the while discussing what we wanted to try the NEXT time we visited I was a bit bummed by the quesadilla which was about three inches in diameter deep fried and served in a wax paper bag Hmmmm not at all what i was hoping for A WORD OF WARNING On seamless web the prices are a 1 higher per item than to eat in That s a pretty steep increase when you consider that many items on the eat in menu are 6 7 or 8 Overall a great meal and a gem of an addition to the UWS 
29ZIguvO_IenVwEVrDQihQ Columbia This place is incredibly convenient to the office so I love it strictly for that factor Some of the other reviewers seem to have had bad experiences but the sandwiches I ve ordered have all met my standards I do think the prices are slightly high but I expect it for the area Please note that this place can be terribly crowded at lunch time which is why I usually get my food to go 
2a4bI6t7De2GS9pJKRvrew Columbia Psycho zoma tic Ethiopian Cuisine in Harlem s Arsenal of New Restaurants The Locale It s funny how I ended up dining here I was actually meeting the venerable Maria M at Melba s My brother and I got there about 15 mins early and it turned out Melba s was closed for a private party Taking advantage that we were early I began to scout other places I knew about around the block There s Billie s Black about 5 blocks up but there was also Zoma a block down I headed to Zoma to do some reconnaissance It looked fitting for El Mayimbe and his guests When Maria arrived at the meeting spot we all walked over to Zoma First thing you ll notice is the simplicity of the dcor the walls in soft pastels with very minimal decorations This is indeed the soma like quality of the place It just eases you into the experience The bar area was beautifully illuminated Place really began to fill after 9pm The Food My first foray into ethiopian eats We ordered a couple signature drinks My brother ordered a Harlem Raging Bull Red Bull tequila vodka and lime and I had the Blue Nile Henessy and pure goodness I personally felt mine was better Plus given the spicy ness of what was to come the sweetness of the drink made for a perfect marriage in gustatory heaven Started off with toasted injera to give our taste buds a warm up We tried to cover all the basic meat groups I had the lamb based Yebeg Alitcha my bro the beef based Tibs Wett and miss Maria the chicken based Doro Wett It was all served on a giant white platter on top of a big piece of injera On the side elegantly rolled pieces of injera to scoop the food with Ah the freedom of eating with just your hands No dilution of pleasure with utensils I cannot tell you how generous the portions were And just when I thought I was out of injera in came our waitress almost psychic like with a fresh round of the good stuff The chicken lamb and beef were all cooked to perfection BAM esque flavor The only thing is that since the beef and chicken use the same seasonings berbere it can seem a bit redundant in terms of flavor The lamb took care of that We couldn t finish the entire meal The Service Top notch Our waitresses had infectious smiles They were quite personable never shying away from innocent flirtatious banter but instead offering smart comebacks I appreciate humor Prices were quite comfortable 
2a5Wvlc-CWjwQY9XPuNhkA Columbia Went for dinner The food was kind of disappointing in that it wasn t imaginitive The food serves its purpose but isn t necessarily inspired Waiter messed up my friend s order which was fine they were happy to bring out a replacement of what she wanted White ish walls inside with oak hardwood floors deceive you because at night it looks much more quaint from outside so it would make you suppose inside is just the same I have very little to say about the food as I can barely remember it Friend had hanger steak which was drowned in a salty and balsamic y sauce Sauce might have been better in moderation but I doubt it I had seafood pasta the few shrimps were beyond tough sauce was thin skimpy flavorless waste of tomatoes 
2AJ3zbx6BiUFviL1Vl0Niw Columbia After getting sick of pad thai I ventured off to try the pad see ew which was sooo delicious Not too greasy and definitely not as sweet as the pad thai I also tried the kow soy for the first time and was again pleasantly surprised The texture of the noodles was great and the broth was sorta creamy and had just enough spice to keep me interested These are my new staples at TM 
2al7S5erBZs1J55XwD0wRg Columbia Just on the south border of Morningside Heights this place is a trek for most but definitely worth it if you re in the area They have some of the most complex savory crepes I ve seen anywhere including in France Example Tiger shrimp black bean paste spinach and basil creme fraiche Southeast Asian influenced French food Usually it s the other way around We were there early on a Sunday morning before 10am so beat the brunch crowd but by the time we were leaving there was a huddle forming in the entrance The crepes were the perfect consistency light and airy crispy on the edges We opted for something less adventurous smoked salmon avocado basil creme bacon The basil creme lived up to the hype and overall the experience was very satisfying Now if they can just get some dry belgium cider in the house 
2AzeicuS4NpjLnht5Ea3DA Columbia OK burger decent Eggs Benedict Good crowd but very busy on weekends Good service doubt I will go back though 
2B0Jl98sbZU8OrV9mzxudA Columbia I m very excited to announce a fantastic dessert at one of my favorite eateries in NYC Community s menu is American eclectic with seasonal local and organic ingredients This just hits the spot for me big time Having dined quite often I ve never had a dessert on their menu I know BIG surprise I d been eyeing everyone s plates and I decided I must try their Warm Organic Chocolate Chunk Cookie Plate Three huge right out of the oven cookies were put in front of me They were so warm and soft that they fell apart just picking them up The amount of chocolate in each cookie was astounding just a bunch of gooey deliciousness You can actually taste the sugar granules I could definitely tell they were made with real organic ingredients just by the fresh taste Now you can obviously share the three cookies but you may want them to yourself If you ever feel like Mom s cookies try this neighborhood spot and be sure to order a glass of milk xoxoBrownie 
2B0obXVhENKDnnscjLqMGw Columbia This place offers free wifi get a code from server large couches and good food and coffee I enjoyed sitting with my laptop and surfing on the internet while eating a pastry and sipping coffee This place is not too expensive and you can sit for hours Don t expect quick table coach service This place is meant for folks to slow down and lounge 
2b8yIzlUT2mBBzpqdPz_qg Columbia There are definitely better places on Upper West than this Would not go back

2bjd2Qptyr7KHBWxFnGDlQ Columbia I was warned the size of their slices would equal my head They were partially right The slice was LARGER than my head But how was the slice It wasn t bad It was more in the traditional NY thin crust style that isn t standing around like many of the places you see They go relatively quickly and with giant offerings it s a pretty decent deal A slice and a can of soda will cost you about 4 50 damn I remember slices were a buck but if you think about the fact that you re technically eating 2 slices it s not such a bad deal in NY anyway 
2BJS5uIrpqBt7mYcSJZWng Columbia We called and made rsvp for sat night and they told us to come at 7 30 we were there at 7 10pm and told us they couldn t sit us until 8 because another party had showed up and took our seats After a long wait we get seated and the waitress gave us the menu and literally 2 minutes to look and decide what to order He said can you please pick quickly because we have another party coming We rushed and picked a few things from the habachi and the sushi menu The Habichi chef arrived and it was the laziest show I ve seen No onion volcano no egg roll no fire Boring boring He dumped the food into one of the plates and it felt on my friends lap awful He started cleaning the habachi grill with us still there and got everything wet You would think that the place was full but they had an empty habachi table for a while 5 of us ate and drank in just 45 minutes It has been the worst experience I ever had in my life Would never never go back to this place Service 5 starts Food 3 starts 
2bqBckaeLKBg3V7Jlv5Krw Columbia The food was really great but I do agree with other reviewers that you should take it to go I also agree that there is not enough room in the pita pouch to put basically anything from the salad bar into your sandwich Other than that the ingredients are really fresh The falafal was tasty and really filling my husband even loved it who is usually very skeptical of these types of healthy vegetarian spots I was very surprised he agreed to go in the first place Oh and their ads of people eating are just horendous so cheasy they made me nauseous If you can snag an extra plate to put the toppings on and add the to pita as you eat take it to go this is a great place to get some good eats 
2bqXS88BNHg0Vxu2FTCrMA Columbia What a great find I ve been wanting to go here walk by it all the time So glad I finally did Our waiter was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu They start you off with some of the best corn bread I ve ever eaten You have to get the Mac and Cheese side dish amazing The fried chicken was delicious as was the pulled pork The ribs weren t my favorite ever but I ate them all so they were obviously good We had the Coconut pineapple cake for dessert It was delicious Light but flavorful Overall I really liked this place You can tell they put a lot of time and effort into making a great menu and atmosphere The service was great and the food delicious Definitely a place to check out 
2BU3S_KAg_s36l6UEkXMzA Columbia The food is delicious and it comes quickly The staff is nice and always asking how things are OK got a tad annoying The space is a bit tight but I guess it makes it more french and less welcoming to large clientele The wait staff is a group of good looking guys some with sexy French accents Go for the food stay for a waiter s phone number and if you can get one share the wealth 
2bxilYvWcbGunyY2IipM9A Columbia Came up on a Sunday evening to have dinner and play trivia The food was solid but considering the price was a steal Had grilled chicken over mashed potatoes and a nice selection of sauteed vegatables I believe that was 10 95 Rolling Rocks were on special for 3 Our table ended up winning the trivia and took home a half magnum of wine I don t live in the area so it s a hall sorry but it s certainly worth checking out if you live in Morningside Heights 
2C2gzy0iVBd4_FC8IhE8qQ Columbia please don t spend your money eating here i have TRIED to like this place due to is close vicinity to school however despite the convenience of the location i just cannot bring myself to eat here anymore the service is bad and the food is just awful why is ollie s still here 
2CS3LYL7NRtZz8tw0ZzjDw Columbia I detest Caffe Swish with the fire of a thousand suns Not only is it overpriced and uninspired pan asian crap but its waiters are also very rude One waiter had the nerve to tell me that the red tea he brought was actually green tea Sorry dude they taste not to mention look totally different That day was the first time I ever gave a waiter no tip b c he messed my order up THREE TIMES I prefer Ollie s to this establishment and that s saying a lot You ll find a lot more Asians in Ollie s than Caffe Swish and not just because of the price issue 
2ctYe06O7A21b9QtNlXACA Columbia Cute restaurant Tasty and affordable pasta in morningside heights Waitresses were very friendly and helpful with suggestions for food on the menu Gives Max Soha a run for its money 
2cuI_JvJijp4_02A7LRoow Columbia Cute cozy with large portions of homestyle food my kind of place It was cold out so the chili lunch sounded like something that could warm me up but when the waiter also mentioned fresh strawberry sangria I had to order some too Chili of the day had a good balance of beans and meat Plus it was served with crusty delicious corn bread The strawberry sangria was so good that my friend and I decided to have a second one and it wasn t as good turned out the 2nd was a fresh batch and the 1st was the bottom of the barrel which meant it had more time to soak up the flavors The service was friendly but relaxed aka slow but no problem cuz I was just hanging out chatting Overall I enjoyed it but it was a bit pricey 
2cWUrXpIRsEeXk-IrW0YGg Columbia Gross gross gross This is exactly the kind of place I try to avoid Nothing looked good on the menu staff was meh and toilet didnt flush Get a picture outside and eat someplace else One extra star for being famous the only reason Im sure this spot is still afloat 
2cxx5ZHh5VjVub4wB1UuHg Columbia Excellent place Such a cute hole in the wall gem Very friendly staff and the two girls at the front greeting people and seating them were very courteous and not at all stuck up and rude like some places in NYC I will definitely come back here 
--05HWh3tFtXAjTV4vquHg Harvard Harvest is such a hidden gem This restaurant is tucked away behind several storefronts in Harvard Square The neon sign outside does not do it justice it is a very upscale restaurant with a great ambiance and inner courtyard The food was great our waiter was able to recommend a nice wine pairing as well We had an interesting sweet corn chowder very rich The french fries with truffle oil are to die for you can t eat just one The fish was excellent and the dessert menu was very nice Would go back for a special occasion in a heartbeat 
--8RcuC1LWyTCE1WP5fYVg Harvard I m teetering Maybe 4 stars Evoo is very good so I ll preface the 3 star treatment by saying that And perhaps I should be more generous since yes it was restaurant week and we all know that restaurant week is probably the worst time to try a restaurant for the first time but It still took WAY too long for each of our courses to be served and my glass was empty on 2 seperate occasions for 10 minutes or more Not cool But the waiter was other wise awesome very funny amicable and knowlegeable I m going to chalk it up to them being very busy but at the same time excuses are excuses nto reasons The dining room nice airy but a little too contrived I felt a bit like I was in a boloco or Arlington VA Inother words modernly vanilla But clean and comfortable so not bad overall The service I ve discussed above awesome in one direction crappy in the otehr HOpefully I was just a bit unlucky The food OK this is the most important category and yeah this is the real winner here The littlenecks in vegetable brothe with lambs bacon was pretty fantastic I felt a little wierd spooning the brothe but it was worth it very tastey Not a huge fan of the bacon but it added a lot of flavor so I could deal with it Main course BEEF sirloin over a grilled slice of marinated eggplant drapped in yellow and green string beans tossed with sweet corn and jalepenos both sweet and spicey This was really pretty freakin good especially for restaurant week The presentatio nwas really very nicely done adn the dish was really a cliched party your mouth Totally dug it Dessert ughmmas homer simpson drool chocolate truffle souffle presented in a lightly carmelized marshmellow pool Do I need to say more I tried to convince the waiter that I had dropped mine on the floor to get a second one He wasn t biting It was pretty effin good Ah Beverages I was pretty pedestrian last night just a few beers and a glass of pinot with dinner The beer was a local brew CDC or something like that slightly malty but had like zero aftertaste and was pretty refreshing for a darker beer not amazing but decent and I guess some of hte proceeds of the profits from the brewery support ALS So Curt Schilling I was helpin your cause out last night while getting a little buzz goin Wine was nothing extroardinary but good for ahouse glass I can t really complain since I was too lazy to look at hte wine list to pick something out OK so I guess I shoudl bounce this up to 4 stars I ll ponder it 
--A4cmT6fwNwRhQtMP8ydg Harvard I don t understand why this place is so highly recommended service is very very slow only one waiter Food portion is very very small Food is ok but over priced After came here twice I decided not to come back again 
--C48_u1O3itnceAG4Necw Harvard without having won a gift card for the place i don t know that i d have ever heard of cafe 47 i m super glad my boyfriend is an avid WEEI listener because this place is great we went on a monday night and were the only ones there save for a few take out orderers cozy and cool i enjoyed the decor and loved the music that was playing lots of live acoustic classic rock led zeppelin came on a few times the service was fast the burgers are pretty much amazing they re very grilly tasting and juicy as tends to always happen i was jealous of my bf s burger the baja shrimp salad was excellent i was weary about the size whether or not it d fill me up so i ordered a side of sweet potato fries the fries were super delicious but i didn t need them because the salad was very filling the layers of flavors were highly complementary and everything was fresh i swapped the shrimp for chicken because i was going to a concert which involves lots of beer and i didn t feel like burping up the sea all night it was a good choice they had rapscallion on tap and it went down nice and easy the narraganset is cheap and i totally wanted to try all the sangrias on the very long wine list the prices are very reasonable and the portions are great such a lovely place 
--kLgVzrVCrpIaqFcZplHg Harvard Nice unassuming Italian eatery Me and the Wifey arrived late thanks to some GPS and parking issues We were told only pizza was available DAMN Oh well pizza it is I had the Fat Boy and the Misses had the Margarita Both were excellent and at 10 each for the small you can t go wrong Beverages and desserts are reasonably priced So I will definitely be heading back Earlier of course 
--nZspRkZQUSj7RM72GMeQ Harvard When I first moved to Boston I had a really bad impression of ABP which dated back to the late 80s in DC Since I ve been working at Kendall Square I ve found that the quality at Bone Pain on Main is extremely high The pastries and breads are much better than I remembered and this is now my 1 choice for quick breakfast on the way in to work I go in for an egg and cheese sandwich on a fresh toasted asiago bagel but half the time the pastries are just too tempting The lunch sandwiches and salads are also quite good though Rebecca s next door gives them an even run for the money 
--xpb60CS8zEDRzMD0lqaw Harvard Cuchi Cuchi Cute atmosphere with tasty appetizers and very good cocktails Karen our server was a doll I ll be yelping back with a detailed report when I come for dinner Four stars due to the fact I haven t tried dinner We ll see how finely it will be executed Five stars to our lovely waitress 
-074mEo_MuLBOfzLTgcc5w Harvard I was pleasantly surprised by the great selections of beer I love Hoegarden on tap the appetizers and pizza We had this eggplant appetizer that was unbelievable We then split 2 small pizzas BBQ chicken and special and they were both equally good Staff was very acessible and approachable Owner equally friendly All for an incredibly reasonable price Best yet it was about a 5 minute walk to Fenway Park after down Commonwealth Avenue Without the stress crowds of the Kenmore restaurants Few tables outside it it was not raining I will definitely be back 
-0H-98olXR_8qiNapt_wtw Harvard I came here on two separate occasions Once after a kayaking outing in the summer so we sat outdoors and it was a party of 5 and then in December for lunch with just my friend and I I didn t like it too much the first time I went and we all had a variety of pizzas there was a smoked salmon one a mac and cheese one a children Alfredo one and a portobello mushroom one I remember the mushroom and salmon specialties were highly regarded amongst the group Their earl grey iced tea was also tasty in the summer My December visit called for a mac and cheese pizza and a chicken with broccoli and caramelized onions with feta cheese pizza The mac and cheese one was good and gooey but needed salt The chicken specialty doesn t taste good if you eat it cold or if you warm it back up I highly recommend sharing these pizzas because even though they are personal pizzas 2 3 slices out of 8 really fill people up Also I have never gotten a salad here but they are not stacked on a bunch of lettuce just to add volume So if the menu doesn t list a lettuce or green do not expect it Just a heads up Oh ya this place is very busy in the summers but not for winter lunches We were the only ones there at 1pm on a Tuesday 
-0idSmMPJmppw-xwQszasw Harvard I am generally a big subway fan and because I usually enjoy the brand and appreciate the options they give me I am giving this place 2 stars instead of one But as many reviewers have said before these people can t get an order right And they go way too crazy on the condiments You re much better off taking your own sandwich to the reading room 
-0nFTjL9OzDAKxDT3M3QPg Harvard Decent italian place Has parking 
-0PZxOXJcG6brIiRhjkung Harvard I have eatten at Harvest over fifty times and it is consistently good The atmosphere is casual comfortable elegance with warm colors and dark woods You can chose to dine at the bar lounge area the dining room or in the outdoor garden area during summer season The bar itself is great when you are alone I eat everything on the menu including varieties of fish steak poultry oysters salads soup hamburger and small bites at the bar They have a full bar and a wine list Sunday brunch is excellent but be sure you very hungry as it is three courses It is great place for a date casual conversation drinks dessert or a special occassion All the waitstaff host and bartenders are very professional and polite This is one my favorites in Boston Cambridge Keep in mind a average dinner is about 75 00 a person Parking in Harvard Square is difficult unless you valet park 
-0q6D6dbzW2ly5b1eDvuhg Harvard There s a reason why Mr Bartley s is a legendary burger joint and still around The explanation is dead simply It s freakin good Reading the menu is a joy in itself and it changes relatively frequently keeping up with current celebrities and happenings Sounds strange Check the pictures and you ll get it Bottomline is that you get super quality ingredients cooked to perfection Hail Mr Bartley 
-0Tabf_pcnDypdFyIDtHrw Harvard Just what Central Square needed Honestly With one of the worst Thai restaurants I have ever tried Pepper Sky and with no other good options for noodles curry and my other favorite things in Central I was so excited when Monkfish appeared And it hasn t disappointed Great noodle dishes basil fried rice an extremely expansive vegetarian menu including lots of vegetarian sushi it s all pretty good not amazing but pretty tasty It s usually crowded but they do take reservations and in my experience they are always pretty efficient no matter how busy the restaurant is And they live up to the name with some sweet jazz tunes playing over the speakers 
-0xgp_OlKt7NixdZ1YOEBQ Harvard Jen recommened Takemura to me and I ve been looking forward to trying it and it lived up to the expectations I got a spicy tuna the crispy creme roll and some yellowtail sushi The server was very friendly and the restaurant was quiet so I got my order quickly The crispy creme was delicious I highly recommend it The spicy tuna was also good although it may have had almost too much in it like a little too big and packed I like nice bite sized spicy tuna rolls I didn t like the yellowtail at all it was a little fishy The other reason I won t give it 5 stars is that they don t deliver anywhere in Somerville not even right behind Porter which is very close to where they are I would order from here a ton if they did If you re in Harvard stop in and get the crispy creme you ll be happy you did 
-0YFPJpcxMf2gutjwPPLlw Harvard I got taken on dates here when I was sixteen I got taken on a date here last year about a month prior to becoming gluten free yes last year shut up a couple of weeks before someone got shot just like when I was sixteen Oh nostalgia It s exactly the same as it ever was except the mural is more worn The pizza is still cheap and good Blotting with napkins for the over abundant grease is necessary but they make up for that requirement with the amount of cheese and toppings Start eating it as hot as you can stand to Past around lunchtime avoid the slices as they get progressively more dodgy as the day goes on just share a pie The mozzarella sticks are still tasty and that sort where the cheese will stretch as far a forearm the steak and cheese subs are way underrated somehow they still have an alcohol license and the drunk college kids naively talking about their lives and their interpersonal relationships still make me giggle 
-0_Gy0SqAWDvq1Tu-oiwIg Harvard We tucked ourselves into a corner in the lounge and people watched We had the time since the service though pleasant was just a touch on the slow side The clientele was an interesting mix of well heeled out of towners Rialto is in a hotel after all young Bostonians and older folks that clearly came here twice a month They moved in knots settling at one table for a while to discuss matters of importance while soaking in the hustle and bustle of Harvard Square coming in through the floor to ceiling windows We ordered off the bar menu which showcased Jody Adam s take on how an urban lounge should serve guests Roasted rosemary walnuts and almonds beat any bowl of peanuts I ve ever eaten at a bar The fresh mozzarella was a shade too soft for my tastes I m used to a world in which cheese sits in a tub of cloudy water for about six hours before it gets served but it was dressed nicely The lobster salad sandwich with avocado got the flavor right but the ratios and price were all wrong Most bars around here serve pizza and do a good job of it Rialto s bar pie of the day had pork sausage over a bed of carmelized onions I was pleased with it overall but I felt as if there should ve been more pass with the pepper mill over the top of it The penne bolognese did wonders for my overall experience Meat in pink sauce over pasta I d be hard pressed to find anything at all wrong with that The last few bites of it were what officially put me over into the too full for dessert category but it s a place I like to be We invested just under two hours there all told and would ve been better served if that number was closer to 90 minutes Still it s a lounge and you re supposed to lounge in one The prices were about 10 higher for two people than I thought they would be but that extra goes into the fact that you re renting some high end real estate for a little while Overall the experience was satisfying and I ll be back in short order 
-10v9jC03Et86MPo8lUoTg Harvard Pizza Terrible Seriously among the worst in town Steak Bomb Awesome Seriously ingenious and among the best in town I call it the Steak Bomb paraphrasing Tom Jones I guess but technically it s not called that on the menu It s the Steak and Cheese combo with Sausage or something like that Yes it sounds like an exercise in serious gluttony and it is But it s also good Very good In fact it s the best item on the menu by far and pretty much the only remotely edible thing here in my view The sub roll is soft the cheese is melty it s got mayo and somehow they get the steak and the sausage to come together into perfect greasy meaty harmony I think their secret is that they use loose sausage like you would use to make sausage patties You too can swear off of Hi Fi Pizza forever Join the Steak Bomb club Also if you are female don t go here alone at 2 am It s just too sketchy and I ve heard too many stories 
-15cH98q1xV6w1PiPh7QFw Harvard I finally made it to Rialto the other day and was not disappointed I had high expectations and came away very satisfied with both my food and the service that I received For a first course I had the Field Greens with Pickled Apples and Blue Cheese For my main course I chose the Grilled Sirloin cooked medium rare My steak was perfectly cooked and had great flavor I usually don t spend 43 on an entree but I was glad that I did The rich Chocolate Torta was a decadent way to wrap up the meal I ll definitely be back 
-1e5YSOeEliHtEzrURz5OA Harvard I was sad to hear that Rokka had closed down but this is a worthy successor though lacking in memories just yet Open late and the sushi is quite good The best sushi in the square according to friends 
-1F1ImtGBFuNikZLy-u5ZQ Harvard Go for the chocolate While their other pastries are fine the chocolate concoctions flour less cakes lava cakes etc are amazing The flavor is so good and strong a single small bite fill fill your entire mouth with bliss Combine this with a nice cup of espresso and you have the perfect after dinner treat 
-1hl1PMJ1alTzv0-zfPCEg Harvard OOh where to start Rendezvous in Central Square you saved me last night After being treated like cattle at Tavern in the Square I harrumphed myself and my fiance down Mass Ave to have a little Rendezvous And by rendezvous I mean a nice dinner I had left probably the worst restaurant I have ever been to and not stayed to eat at because the vibe was just so horrible and walked into a haven of food fun and politeness what a surprise We were greeted by the very pleasant hostess who told us that their bar had 2 seats and that you can eat at the bar So that s what we did This bar is comfortable No whacking your knee on an ill made table like at that god awful place I left No loud people standing literally next to you and resting their arm on your table as you perused a TGI Friday s on steriods menu No no At Rendezvous in Central Square you might feel like you stepped into an oasis of culture warmth and good food I got the Saut ed halibut with apple butternut squash smoked bacon sage and cider butter sauce and I literally ate every morsel And I even used a piece of bread to delicately sop up the remaining sage and cider butter sauce and what a sauce it was Priced at 27 00 it is a bit steep for the portion but it is spot on for the quality of this dish I enjoyed it immensely My fiance got the potato gnocchi with foraged mushrooms black truffle piave cheese and for 13 00 this was an exceptional value Again portions were small He also got the turnip soup that he deemed delicious I tried a spoonful but it was not for me But most things aren t Their wine list is extensive and the gentleman who tended bar looked to be extremely well versed in all things alcohol He even tested each drink he made but since I m on the wagon I opted for water and it was Cambridge s finest Seriously if this was tap water it did not taste like it They should bottle this stuff For dessert I got a small cheese plate that was 8 00 it came with a beach plum jelly and raw cow s milk cheese from France some almonds and bread I got a cup of lemon chamomile tea it was perfect I m a tea snob this was some high tea Excellent I am not a fan of Central Square sorry folks But I am a big fan of Rendezvous in Central Square Thanks for saving me Rendezvous 
-1io9QTKoIUDIt77CsaSLQ Harvard Went here late Friday night and had no trouble getting a table for 3 They didn t have the first few beers we ordered The spinach and artichoke dip was like nothing I ve seen before looked like ground up grass or something Tasted a little spicy too so I didn t end up eating any of it but my boyfriend enjoyed it When the waiter found out one of our group was vegan he brought out complimentary salsa to go with the chips Cool decor and nice service 
-1pjwyjNon6EnkP27-hlJQ Harvard Some of the most delicious garlic knots I ve had Pizza crust is perfect combination of soft chewy and crisp Any time you add clams and bacon on a pizza you will win 
-1riAJFhdNCMuYs9PVPJHQ Harvard I visited Hungry Mother about a month ago and though it took me so long to review it I haven t stopped thinking about it A friend and I had dinner here early on a Friday as reservations are hard to come by Still when I walked in be careful you don t don t walk on by because it only has a small wooden sign demarcating its doorfront from the other houses on the block the hostness said our table was available and led me directly to it To start off I ordered the Bartender s Choice and described a drink that was tart fresh springlike but not overly sweet The waitress brought back something altogether surprising and delicious whiskey with citrus and bitters which tasted exactly as I wanted it to taste What with all the raving we started out with the boiled peanuts which were fun and messy to eat They were well sprinkled with sea salt but since the peanuts were not shelled the salt didn t really permeate all the peanuts leaving some bland We also shared some starters fiddleheads with a soy sauce of some kind and the gnocchi which was delicious but the portion was quite small As a gnocchi lover I m always left wanting more I ordered the pork which was inconsistent one cut was very fatty and flavorless while the other was tender and seasoned and meaty It came with collard greens and grits I loved the greens but even Hungry Mother can t make me like grits I m sorry to say My friend s catfish was perfectly cooked with evenly crispy skin and juicy flaky meat Somehow we still found room for dessert My lemony shortbread with rhubarb came with the tastiest tarragon ice cream I ve ever had The meal ended on a high note but I d have to come back again to see if the entr es will knock it out of the park for me 
-1xFS36_MkjmjAV8UdsYKQ Harvard sure I ll meet you there for a beer location great and people watching cant be beat Do NOT recommend the watery lobster bisque horrible go with what everyone else recommends here I wish I had 
-20lUFLJFmuSMKzBK7Tgfw Harvard 9 tastes has a very extensive menu especially for vegetarians If you like spicyyy the real kind of spicy not the american kind of spicy you ll like this place The red curry with a thai iced tea is my favorite It s also very cheap 9 15 dish 
-2CL5jrnY2ezFBsTz2IBWw Harvard I have a rule Only order stuff on menus that you can t or won t make at home Which is why cheesecake du jour and chocolate cake were my top two choices this afternoon Inside the restaurant Fabulous decor Because of it s plush interior I found myself craving some port wine even though it was only 12 30 PM when I went Then I realized that boozing chocolate would be amazing but I d have to walk home and when I m flopping around in the street screaming Chocolate Aaaaaargggh Delicious cacao bean how you torment my taste buds people won t know that I just had a drink too early in the day they ll think I m a crazy lady Cheesecake Slightly sweet with a nice blueberry flavor Excellent crust overall 4 5 to 5 stars But the Chocolate Cake THE CHOCOLATE CAKE I purposefully didn t take a sip of my water after my last bite just so I could wiggle my tongue around my teeth to find that last little hiding bit of fabulousness wedged in between my molars Absolutely 5 Whenever you go ALWAYS order something chocolate Don t go here for lunch Eat nothing or just a little something and then go for a giant delicious dessert and make someone go with you so you can order two things and try both Yes it s more expensive than Shaws cakes but you can t make this stuff at home I don t care how awesome you think you are Even if it looks like Finale desserts you won t be able to bridge the vast taste canyon 
-2fD9ZE7olWZW7JSnpd-Kg Harvard This place is cheaper than the Boston Mission Some lazy friends from Somerville had me drag my ass across the river for brunch and I m glad I think the breakfast menu topped out at about 4 95 and not 800 00 like the Centre Street Cafe boo hiss I had a delightful omelet with toast and home fries It was great but I would have liked a heads up on the menu saying it would be covered in some GROSS grilled vegetable medley I fucking HATE Mushrooms After picking those off it was super One of my friends ordered her eggs over easy and they were near raw It looked like someone cracked an egg on a hot plate and folded it over I told her to take it home because I was going to make cookies later Plz cook them longer thankiez There wasn t a long wait to to be seated at 2 00 pm on a Sunday I think there was one waitress though After about 10 minutes she asked what we wanted for drinks we wanted to fucking ORDER We were STARVING at that point The menu also has a variety of salads and sandwiches that are double cheap I d totez go here again Our total was 16 for 3 people beverages oh shit I don t think they had ANY kind of liquor mimosas or bloody marys don t forget to flask it 
-2gqhv2lMIwK_N-4TUDLVQ Harvard Born on the Mason Dixon Line Southern food has and will always have a spot in my heart and my stomach I had been dying to come here since the moment I first read about and reading the reviews on yelp just wet my appetite some more It took a blizzard to finally get my bf and I to cross the river and try it Let me start by saying it was worth the dangerous taxi ride It was relatively empty due to the weather conditions but surprising full considering what the sky was doing Our server was great full of helpful recommendations and very attentive We started out with boiled peanuts cheesy grits and the croque monsieur biscuits I could have had appetizers and side dishes as my meal and walked out satisfied and full All three we had were wonderful I ve only ever had grits that good in South Carolina Our main meals were delicious I got a corned beef that was special on the menu and brought over half home for lunch the next day We finished with the sweet potato pie a favorite of mine It came out piping hot don t worry we made sure not a crumb was left Two last things to note the mixed drinks are very good I don t remember what we had but we each liked them And if you go before 6 or 7 and you re seeing a movie at the theater near by they will buy your tickets for you and you ll get them at a discounted rate I cannot wait to back to this one 
-2HDCuavUbDm5XFz0Nw1sA Harvard My fianc and I always go to Passage to India but we decided to try a new Indian restaurant and Cafe of India was A OK I marked down outdoor seating but in reality it s that they open up the whole front of the restaurant so it s outdoor seating without the sun burn Great atmosphere down by Harvard a great place to relax and have a long meal on a sunny afternoon I had the lamb tikka masala and cleared my plate it was all it was that good We also had the garlic naan but I wasn t as much of a fan of it I like Passage to India s more as it is fluffier Service wasn t that great slow and sort of seemed annoyed but the food more than makes up for it Good spot for a date 
-2kJKwJmqaK7UYxefdjmsQ Harvard Love this cozy little place It s great for brunch My favorite are the dirty chai lattes mmm 
-2luynxj9OIGpxkD4c_d4A Harvard 4 stars for friendly service and reliably good and cheap food 
-2Pihjs7klseF376C1EZVA Harvard Beautiful service and food in a quiet tucked away corner 
-2RZYXLGh9BvljfmECAdGQ Harvard I came here on Boston Marathon Weekend from out of town ready to carbo load for the race The food was really great here sort of your hipster all american country style hefty brunch foods all tasty I split the Eggs Benedict with side of their must have pumpkin pancake dude the pumpkin pancake yes just ONE pancake couldnt be finished between the 2 of us it was bigger than my head and filled with warm spicy pumpkin filling and just the right amount of chocolate morsels melting into the dish At the same time this dish wasn t overloaded with sugar trust me i hate overly sweet dishes for brunch it was just right In addition a tasty butter was served on the side Ordering a side of their Home Fries is an ABSOLUTE must It is SO good If you want this dish on steriods order the Omar Platter it s the Home fries and then some Whatever they do to flavor their potatoes has a standout flavor well spiced I also absolutely LOVE their coffee I asked what they served and turns out it s a local brew from the New Hampshire Brewing Company Totally need to go online and order their means Lastly their artsy laid back atmosphere just makes it a hotspot to gather together with friends for brunch for cozy conversation I love this place 
-2Wld4W3ymXYiA2ktX-RwA Harvard It s too expensive but i enjoy the concept Apparently they have a damn good burger but i didn t go that route The whole healthy eating concept can be maintained here but may be blown by the buffet style eating I enjoyed it but it was an experience not really a repeat customer type thing 
-2z7JmX595zRVaI3MvbZ8A Harvard So far just a review of lunch I had long avoided F I amidst complaints it was too pricey or too gimmicky And because I was a vegetarian Well I finally hit the place up for lunch and I have to say I m a fan The little tagline of improvisational dining or interpretive dining or whatever may have made me want to retch but not the food and not the pricing Still I think cafeteria style hibachi might be closer to truth Here the main clarification that would have helped me figure out F I before I got there Most people say it s all you can eat while some folks complain about being charged for an extra bowl of food Well they re both right but it s the best of both worlds you start with a bowl for 7 95 which is smallish but can hold a great deal of food if you pile it on right Then if that bowl and a plate from the included salad bar and the rice and tortillas they bring to the table aren t enough to sate you you can convert the whole thing to endless trips for 3 more You don t have to decide first and you can easily get an obscene amount of food for 8 Just to emphasize you certainly don t as some people made it sound pay for an all you can eat situation but then get charged for additional trips That s just crazy talk It is gimmicky as evidenced by the fact that they had to give it a kitschy tag But that gimmick includes endless customization options Pick your veggies pick your starches pick your meats pick your sauce Or skip the veggies because there s a salad bar and skip the starches because you get rice and tortillas That s a honkin huge pile of meat for 8 and a good variety to choose from There was a good variety of sauces as well though the teriyaki I ended up with thinking I was playing it safe for my first time there was actually pretty bad There s also a sandwich burger option that seems to operate similarly but which I did not investigate But if the concept of an 11 all you can eat burger bar with all the fixins appeals to you by all means ask if that s really how it works I ll try to remember to ask when I go back and update here 
-32TEBuzbdTixsn0iVJ6mQ Harvard It may not be gourmet but I always have a good time at Border Cafe We go there for a laid back and fun atmosphere that does not end up costing us a fortune The only downfall the crowd and the wait Sometimes it is outrageous But I would wait to have the delicious corn and black bean empanadas As for the margaritas They are sub par but you pay for what you get If you want a fine dining experience I don t know why you would end up at Border Cafe in the first place 
-33nPb4ntPYdJWkfsH4MPw Harvard Two of my friends and I were traipsing around Newbury St one sunny late morning window shopping and generally just enjoying the beautiful weather When somebody decided it was time for a meal and when somebody else decided it was too late for breakfast oops we stopped by Cafe 47 on a whim to get some lunch The decor inside is immediately striking somehow combining a red brick Italian pizza place atmosphere with a hip cocktail sipping abstract art on the wall feel in a way that s not completely discordant We were quickly seated the place was almost empty at 1pm on a Wednesday and our waitress was quick and friendly although I suspect she was relatively new to the place The menu is probably best described as modern Italian American bistro fare with paninis sandwiches salads and desserts and was neither overwhelming nor overly sparse We all ordered the lunch special which included a soda half of a panini and a salad for the extremely reasonable price of 8 Our food wound up being quite good with the best part being the Poached Pear Salad with candied walnuts bleu cheese a vinaigrette and delicious pieces of poached pear The paninis with well made though unremarkable Overall a great place to get lunch especially with the 8 lunch special I look forward to returning soon 
-35f__B4afF9iH-RYGFcOQ Harvard Ok I can understand the love of this place for margaritas but unless you plan on only getting that one drink because the daiquiri s suck I would suggest finding any location other then this one for Mexican Hell even Anna s may be better The real question remains how can you mess us a drink A blended ice ridden daiquiri was what I was served The salad not bad until the meat came which was like a sponge with jerk flavoring that was too spicy for human consumption unless you burned them all off at the ripe age of 5 Second the rub put on the chicken makes it impossible for a human to recognize food underneath the blackened mess How it is served I will not know I do know that the drink came in handy after a taste test The reason for those 2 stars the staff was nice and it was fun to look at the walls the drink even lacking in luster wasn t bad the best par the salsa try it sometime with a drink but nothing else However it was a waste of time and I think taco bell would serve better mexican 
-38MDZwGe1dJv_Si-6tLJg Harvard This review is solely for the lunch barbecue on the patio And the first word that comes to my lips is drumroll please Deeef nlicious This is by far the best lunch deal in Kendall For nine bucks you get an amazing slab of meat two delicious sides and a drink It s so fresh and so clean clean right off the grill Bonus points for the free watermelon to top off the meal With choices of lemonade and iced tea feel free to mix yourself a perfect for summertime Arnold Palmer kick back on the brick patio and enjoy the sunshine and the delicious food I highly recommend the salmon Yum The only downside to this place is the plastic plates utensils It really lowers the meal a notch and makes me feel uberguilty because there is no recycling bin as well Blue Room let s see some legit silverware and place settings I m not asking for fine China but your food quality deserves proper presentation Or at least a recycling bin 
-3OZuAzob1Xezkzzf8zDPw Harvard I ve been told by several local residents that this is the best take out delivery pizza place in the Cambridge area Because Toscanini s is next door I d opted for ice cream instead of real food at Cinderella s until the other day We had take out at 10pm on a Saturday One star for being open until at least 1am every night of the week and having high quality food at any hour The croutons on the ceasar salad were homemade possibly bits of their garlic bread and they were delicious as was the dressing Another star and a half for that The onion rings were thickly breaded perfectly round and abundant Half a star for accuracy The pizza the crust was clean and chewy and fresh tasting it wasn t overcooked and crunchy and it almost tasted like they used purified water or something that sorta felt like the culinary equivalent of a warm face cloth Another star The toppings were all fresh no canned nothing plentiful and wonderfully proportioned to the cheese and delicious sauce The fifth and absolutely deserved star For bonus points add that it s a family owned business that has metered parking around the block and a nice ambience for highly affordable and delectable pizza 
-3Sunx9cH_c7K9mb0dJXIg Harvard Could go here twice a week oh wait I do I recommend the lamb and the Falafel 
-3tXPyHq00eqKs-vMqZ_Zg Harvard Lord Hobo has a solid beer list and delicious food It s worth the hassle to park and the journey all the way to Cambridge Hobo has a pretty big bar but there are also quite a few tables It s a great place to get dinner or just a few beers Everything on their food menu looks awesome so it was really hard to decide on one thing for dinner I settled on the Mac and cheese which was served in a flaming hot skillet and was tasty I m glad that s the entree that I selected I shared the polenta fries as an appetizers and I actually wish that I had gotten one for myself For dinner They were UNREAL and I will proceed to order me every time I go back The lights are usually fairly dimmed so it has a great ambiance However it can be a little hard to read the menus especially when there are so many beers to choose from at least 2 pages The bartenders know all abut the beers on tap which is refreshing 
-3XOnlFYnczLLDcFKi8qzQ Harvard 7 minutes for a pressed sandwich i ll take this wait any time The food here is wonderful especially for one of the pressed paninis I love the atmosphere the selection of sandwiches and the coffee The staff always seems like they are having a good time and it makes me want to work here The prices are a bit steep but I think it is def worth it Grab you sandwich find a bench outside and enjoy 
-3yOk60WTx5SkmSCqF_s1g Harvard Awesome food great drinks Try the green burger or the chicken under a brick Both are excellent The Perfect Storm with its 5 year rum and ginger beer mixture is the perfect drink compliment to any meal Came here for Valentine s Day and it was surprisingly not busy The atmosphere was pretty good even though they were stuck on an early 90s rock metal lite music playlist The only reason I bring it up was that it didn t seem to fit the decor nor what I would imagine are their target clientele I can t complain though and it didn t spoil dinner in the least We were able to talk eat drink and just have a great night out They didn t rush us through dinner they seemed pretty happy to just have us sit chill for a bit Overall a really fun night 
-42fpmotKeS-NwtlU4gLqw Harvard Now I ve always been a huge fan of Chipotle but today made me an even bigger fan When I went in to order my usual steak burrito they were out of steak for about 60 seconds time The manager then gave me the burrito for free along with a free drink Easily the most refreshing customer service experience I ve had in years Thank you Chipotle for restoring my faith in man kind 
-4gJYBJnk9QjMakpFwsUag Harvard This spot sits in Harvard Square and is a nice after dinner treat with some pretty good drink recipes and nicely done desserts The menu offers all sorts of selections and some good after dinner wines toddies and coffees The prices are reasonable and the service is friendly and fast The decor is pretty cool and it was a real nice spot to venture after a meal and the hours are open late so there is no worry about closing time 
-4oeC4ipfb7IOVxZ81p9Ng Harvard Disgusting That a place serves alcohol does not in itself justify more than one star 
-4v37mHr2Ev_rT-aMdCBdQ Harvard Awesome outdoor roof deck best I have been to in the Boston area in some time though it did not have those gas heat lamps that so many outdoor places have which means on even a warm day the area gets a bit cool when the sun goes down A great space indoor and out solid menu with good basics but nothing really over the top burgers stuffed chicken a couple of fish selections etc Prices are also pretty average ranging in that 15 25 per entree area The service was the only blemish really The host staff was rude and the waitress wasn t rude per sey just kind of cold It didn t help that she dropped half a glass of red wine on my white shirt and then didnt even bother to take said glass of wine off of the bill which seemed to me like it should have been a pretty standard thing I mean her sloppiness ruined a 40 shirt so comping me a 9 glass of wine would have been nice 
-4x24Ub932tc7QZ5Y9_6sw Harvard If you are a strict vegetarian vegan or have specific food no nos Fire and Ice is not the place for you Because everything is cooked on one giant stove by a pair of old looking twins food constantly gets mixed together Everyone can expect to find pieces of food from their neighbor s bowl Overall the food is ok It s typically quite crowded so it can get loud The sauce can be quite heavy in flavor Don t feel obliged to fill the little cup with sauce Also you can request to have cheese added on top of your food or burger Also keep an eye on your food because they will always ask which set is yours while they are cooking If you don t know they ll add the wrong sauce to your food or they ll add your sauce to the wrong food 
-4_UIw4QhgM3IfUJ5ZSjpA Harvard You know how authentic Mexican joints sometimes have pictures of Mexico on the wall This place has pictures of authentic Mexican restaurants on the wall And that about sums up what this burrito joint is about Authenticity aside these burritos are pretty tasty The guacamole and pico de gallo are fresh and delicious and they are included in the price of most of the burritos The fillings are also tasty especially the spicy chicken Extra star for having a complimentary salsa bar The green salsa verde and onion cilantro mix are the perfect accompaniment to any burrito 
-50HnKnKYRTMoJxidZhD7g Harvard Do you like your homefries to come from fresh rather than frozen potatoes Do you like your omelets cooked in cast iron pans with butter rather than on teflon pans with some kind of ozone eating lubricant Do you like your grits home cooked for hours instead of poured out of cardboard box If yes the finest breakfast in all of Boston can be had here Plus it s reasonably priced and only really crowded on weekends They don t lie when they call the cooking fresh and honest Would be a homerun if they served loose leaf tea and kept the coffee a bit hotter Screw that Even with drab tea selection it s a home run and easy five star It s a bit on the fancy side with lots of power brokers and Harvard celebrities munching away But if you can get over that and don t mind eating breakfast off a freshly laundered table cloth you ll be in pig heaven 
-56nxIlcL2jxaP5nY8mMSQ Harvard I have been to cafe Luna almost every weekend since the start of the year so at least 20 times for their weekend Brunch and I still have a fantastic time every time I go The specifics of why it s so good everyone else has covered really well and you just need to try it words are not enough

-59JkbHjKKVHc5GwH78LMQ Harvard Went with friends hoping to find a new restaurant to add to our favorites list Dined there on a Sunday night their prix fixe night Enjoyed a 3 course meal app entree dessert for 38 First course The Boston lettuce salad with cheddar and apples was a perfect combination of ingredients Entree I had the Bollito misto a delicious vegetarian selection Friends had the steak frites and Braised pork and veal meatballs Everyone enjoyed their meal Desset Pear crostada Filling but tasty Oh and their bread was amazing Reminded me of the yeasty flavor of When Pigs Fly bread Service was great too Highly recommend 
-5aqYb5ZP0pErO1OWY0cYA Harvard Bartley s is a gimmick Best place for burgers they are not But definitely worth a try just for the experience It s loud crowded and you will probably have to share a table with strangers As far as the food the burgers are big and juicy with ample toppings I d say they are okay but really not worth the money As for the fries the regular ones are good The sweet potato ones were extremely soggy Not impressed In summary its a good place to bring tourists or to try at least once However it s expensive 25 30 for 2 people for what you get and the food isn t the best quality 
-5BxH4LuoRbRcrbG-4Aw2w Harvard Hungry Mother I effing love you I don t even want kids and I would totally have like 10 of your babies I would love to find a way to concoct that wonderful 55 cocktail at home That and the fried green tomatoes and the ham on a biscuit with red pepper jelly and now I m making myself hungry Pretty please think about being open for lunch if even just a kickass Sunday brunch sometime in the near future just a thought 
-5kJPWsmHmUMEXvyBkdfqw Harvard The only reason this place lost a star was because of the long wait but how can they help it when their food is so amazing Pancakes Huge and amazing Egg Sandwiches on thick slices of the homemade bread of your choosing are you kidding me Unreal Love Not to mention I washed this down with the BEST Irish Coffee of my life Order it Seriously 
-5LuHOoUKlhYayNY5XIE6A Harvard I love the risotto its close to my apt reasonably priced and good food Service has always been great Can t lose

-5o_ffhxQnH2SZOIlcHTqQ Harvard So in this update I m giving Lord Hobo five stars for being awesome minus one star for being so expensive Why you ask A review of our finances from this winter should answer both questions The truth is that in February we spent more money at Lord Hobo than we did on groceries Yowch I think perhaps we like too much 
-5WitNw28MNLzyBQc6Su2w Harvard Went here with a few friends for brunch and it was great paid around 29 and had a delicious plate or two of food and of course dessert I d say go here but go early it gets crowded 
-5Z6wcI-Ag5WhJP1ileJeg Harvard By far the best meal we ve had in the Boston area in a long time From the wait staff to the environment to the food to the drinks the place was top of its game We had a hightop table across from the kitchen were we could see all the action and everything that was plated made us want to order it We had the tasting menu and the favors got bigger and bolder as we moved through the meal I also need to call out the cocktails as they made the night We had a cocktail flight which meant we were able to sample 4 cocktails along with our meal I would strongly reco you try this as it was the perfect way to try drinks you might not order yourself Fantastic night 
-6atIPyHlAFtUOI4C1ZWcA Harvard The menu is interesting I had a salad with dried cherries and grilled chicken They only have beer to drink but its a refreshing choice for their outdoor patio in the summer 
-6AYm4VeQR0KMoWqv32DWg Harvard Review Summary Emma the original owner was aggressive and rude Sadly the current owner is agressive and rude and also has a terrifying temper The food is excellent but stay away from Emma s unless you re willing to check your self respect at the door To begin with some history for those of you more recent immigrants to Cambridge Emma s is a Cambridge institution The original Emma s was up in West Cambridge in a small storefront in Huron Village Emma was a notoriously unpleasant Italian woman who I remember being intensely afraid of as a child because she would yell at people who came in There were two pizza joints on Huron Ave then Emma s and the still surviving Armando s Every pizza night local Cantabrigians faced an awful conundrum brave Emma s wrath to get the best pizza in town thin crust and perfectly peppery before all that was hip or go see Armando who was kind to children supported little league and made deeply unremarkable pies Emma s Pizza was excellent but you couldn t be certain she would let you stay We learned young not to send the weird looking kid to get the slices she might refuse to give them to him Anyway after Emma passed away I was please that her fine pizza was reincarnated into a hip creative new eatery in Kendall Square with a seemingly much better attitude I ve had many happy meals at the new Emma s Their pizza is delectable the tuna melt is luscious and their basic salad is one of my favorites get the red wine vinaigrette excellent advice I took from the friendly silver haired waitress Also they have beer Okay so why give Emma s one star you ask Well today at Emma s was first time I ve been thrown out of anywhere a first I didn t expect would happen over iced teas at a lunch with my father to discuss my wedding plans Here s what happened We walked in got a table for 2 and ordered teas from the nice waitress My dad asked for the BLT and I went for my fave salad with chicken All was going well as we sipped our drinks and fell deep into a discussion about the wedding band It is relevant here that I have a connective tissue disorder that causes irritation in my joints and makes it difficult for me to sit in chairs for long periods of time so I m fidgety and I often as I did today slip off one flip flop and nestle a foot into my lap to relieve my knee pain As we talked I was unconsciously sitting this way Suddenly a tall guy with dark hair interrupts our conversation and with no preamble or introduction points down and say you need to put on your shoes I felt kind of flustered by this A little confused I pointed to my other food securely on the ground and in my shoe and stammered something about how I wasn t barefoot I just had one foot in my lap He repeated I said put your shoes on now and then walked abruptly away I had no objection to doing so but would it have killed him to just ask nicely Now the sensible thing would have been to stick my foot in my shoe and just grumble over my salad but I don t like to leave things with bad feelings and I felt he d been really rude about something that there was no reason not to be polite and friendly about So I got up and walked in my shoes of course to where the man was talking to another guy I said Excuse me I d like to talk to you about what just happened Now seriously the guy just exploded There is nothing to talk about he said loudly That s why it says no shirt no shoes no service so if you don t want to wear your shoes you can get out And he continued angrily it was incredibly rude of you to interrupt my conversation so I think you should leave Suddenly literally for asking to talk to him I was being thrown out Wow At this point things get a little fuzzy Voices are raised he walks back into the dining room I follow my dad has reared up in daddy grizzly mode and has started in Now look here I ve been coming to this restaurant for 30 years and Dark haired man was having none of it Well you won t be coming here any more he yelled Get out of my restaurant now The dining room is small and everyone was staring I m thinking ohmigod why is he yelling at us At this point I m sorry to say we kind of lost it too I m not proud My dad let loose a shocking M F bomb which caused the guy to yell to his staff to call 9 11 We started to walk out but I couldn t help lecturing the silent room about how he had kicked us out for no reason because they were looking at us in horror Sorry other diners I know we seemed like jerks at the end there but aggressive and mean is no way to run a restaurant The proprietor took a cell phone photo of us for his surely extensive wall of local undesirables I guess we ve now entered the criminal class of people who fidget and don t like to be treated poorly 
-6gDqbVc3tegK-ym98OkSA Harvard Cadillac fajitas and Cajun popcorn we have a date Friday night Don t make me wait too long ok I ve tried just about everything on this menu and have never been disappointed except for one time bones came in my catfish one incident in over 5 years of yumminess hardly counts Especially for the prices Unlike many restaurants I frequent this is one of the few places I ll experiment Generally I go to the same establishment for the same thing Indeed many places all over town could probably recite an order of mine This Friday it ll be what has come to be my favorites but truly many things have satisfied me here 
-6hL4N9VCgyuj-6M_wIe8g Harvard So you took her on a date Why not Not the prettiest girl in the world but she laughed at your lame joke and there was something about the way she twirled her hair So the date went well And so did the second Didn t get past second base but meh there was just something about the way she smiled at you You think Maybe it s just because she lives just down the street Or maybe its cause she always answers the door even if it s 2am in the morning You don t know hell most of the time you go see her the room s spinning from one to many at Redline or Middlesex Lounge and you can t be bothered to think about why s and hows Until suddenly you re walking down the aisle and her gap toothed smile catches the corner of your eye from under her veil and you think to yourself how did it come to this And you know it s gonna be lamb roll ups for the rest of your life Yep Moody s is kind of like that 
-6HYPfrLZq-4uL67H6K1-g Harvard Yeah I may be addicted to the chickpea fritter Also the service is excellent The staff actually knows me by name Not too shabby for a food truck I ve tried most of the other sandwiches but always come back to the chickpea fritter Not a massive fan of the rosemary fries They don t have that crunch I m looking for I m not a vegetarian but will eat here a lot Nice job Plus nutritional information is on their website 
-6s5Lh5kMy9Uxxla67LQ3w Harvard Very cool atmosphere beautiful decorations felt like we were in an art nouveau painting Lovely hostess and wait staff very fun and friendly We ordered the lobster and avacado duck l orange steak fried artichokes and some cocktails Everything couldn t have been more delicious and came to our table so fast The cocktails were lovely all prohibition themed and tasty and we even had an after dinner shot It was served in a crazy bottoms up shot glass that the waitress described the history of All in all would love to go here any old time or for a special occasion Two thumbs way up 
-7-oSbBuo30Om3S7biaUlg Harvard I have been here a couple of times I go back for sentimental reasons My now husband and I had our first date there We went there again last night I love the margaritas The food is ok Nothing great tex mex and canjun kind of mex Not the authenitic kind of food but good and filling I love the chips and salsa Warm and salty goodness If you go at the right time you can get seated right away before about 5 30 or 6 at night otherwise expect a wait The waitstaff and mgmt has always been attentive 
-70iz_mHQ-Kq97OVpauQVA Harvard Monday night karaoke is a blast Way better than anyplace else in Boston They have an unlimited music selection more than any other karaoke we have been to The staff was awesome and the atmosphere was fun Drinks and apps were very reasonably priced and fed the whole table for under twenty They even give away a 50 00 gift card at the end of the night I hope they expand to other days of the week

-7eG2WInjLQPfSEBmwqiJA Harvard Horrible got food poisoning GI upset a few hours after the meal so I can naturally only think to blame this place Also we were seated next to a crying baby and when we asked to be re seated we were seated right next to the cash register waiters bump in to you 
-7gPp4ehu213OyNl4fCDUQ Harvard Dear Middle East I love you You re an institution and you deserve your acclaim But please please PLEASE fix the sound in the ME Upstairs room If the band playing the room has more than three instruments the sound turns to mush I don t think it s the fault of the resident sound guy I put the fault squarely in your lap s Don t be like TTs 
-86AkryqAFo3mAy5rWg7dA Harvard Not liking this one as much Go to Kendall Sq if you have to go to a Doyle s I do like the design of the place Multi floors is great What I don t like is the staff I ve never had an issue personally but the guy who runs the security Teddy is a straight up jackass Basically he s unable to get on cambridge police but believes he s the law around the area Brags about how his roommate is a Cambridge Police Officer except the word from CPD officers is that neither have warm feelings towards them from CPD Oh and while most bouncers are there to watch over the general safety of the bar You re more likely to be creepily and aggressively sexually harassed by the bouncers than you are by the patrons Not cool Also have witnessed while at another bar multiple bouncers from doyle s actually leave Tommy Doyle s to track down and threaten some guy at another bar for something stupid Way to do your job Who was watching over Doyle s then I suggest Kendall Sq location to avoid the pervy bouncers with authority issues Basically the Doyle s security staff make their bar an unpleasant experience for many but then they also like to spread their wealth of sex offenderish behavior and aggressive attitudes to the neighboring bars as well

-9b9vG2tOg8KCdaop5P6GQ Harvard Simply put the most delicious overflowing omlettes I ve had The eggs seem almost like a distraction next to the prodigious quantity of vegetables The home fries are great too An exceptional breakfast brunch That said the service is notoriously unpredictable I ve had some long waits both to sit and to order and the staff seems different every time hilariously I ve had some children who happened to be hanging around bring me my silverware But all is forgiven when the food comes Oh man I m hungry just thinking about it 
-9Ei4mop6kWAt4dNgVcCOA Harvard I finally had a chance to make it over to Mr Bartley s last night Completely on a whim my wife suggested we roll over to check it out since the last time we tried they were closed Anyway the overall experience was exactly what I had expected from a place that is well known for good burgers totally packed with customers ok service and small cramped tables However we were able to order while waiting for a table which was awesome Overall the burgers were very good You can taste the quality in the burger and without slathering any mustard or ketchup on my sandwich that stuff only masks the true flavor of the beef the overall flavor was delicious The meat reminded me of Louis Lunch in New Haven which is a good thing However the onion rings that came with my burg were just ok They were shoe string onion rings but drenched in a very flour y tasting batter Needless to say I ll be back to try the dozens of burgers on the menu Don t forget to bring cash 
-9Enpq8swK3J0Euq1exR5A Harvard I ve always been a Qdoba fan and this establishment seemed to serve up exactly as expected I ordered a shredded beef burrito and was very happy with the taste quality and overall experience consuming it There are three nice booths beyond the fountain bev area which are much quieter and more intimate than the large boisterous dining room 
-9JaAPUcIbgbrddC3zTMHA Harvard i ve only been here once but i freaking LOVE this place i went here a month ago because my friend saw it on phantom gourmet she got the tom brady and i got the ipod we didn t have to wait in line that long i suggest you look at the menu online before going because they have like 50 different burgers to choose from but you don t have to get a burger but i suggest it my burger had boursin cheese on it it was so good that i had to get me some from shaw s THANK YOU SHAW S FOR HAVING A SALE ON BOURSIN CHEESE YOU MUST GET THE SWEET POTATO FRIES best sweet potato fries i ve ever had hands down better than b good no offense b good i can t even describe the feeling into words when you bite into those orange fries delicious is an understatement why only 4 stars if i love this place NO REFILLS i m sorry but that really bothers me but i am glad you serve coke and NOT pepsi because i despise pepsi oh and they only take cash you better get some before you come 
-9lxMYj9g-AesIVC_RUq3A Harvard If you re happening to be in Harvard Square you definitely need to check out this place I always seem to order the same thing grilled chicken sandwich and I finally switched it up and order pork pulled it was good but i definitely love their grilled chicken better The price is definitely affordable 
-9QorjguYxDcprwnqqkOOw Harvard I like this place because I eat a lot and I think it s fun putting them together for them to stirfry together for me BUT everything always ends up tasting kind of the same after awhile Fun nevertheless I think that s most of the appeal 
-9vPjGy9ws9f0OAEdnyQPg Harvard I m not a fast food fan but when I m in a real rush i e it s 1 18 PM and I m starving but I still haven t left home for my 1 30 PM meeting that s a 10 minute walk away nothing beats the Southern Style Chicken sandwich at McDonald s and this one happens to be a few blocks from my apartment and on my way to work Within 2 min and at a cost of a little over 3 I have something tasty to fill my growling tummy that I can easily eat while walking and of course it helps me avoid sitting through a 2 hour meeting on an empty stomach While it doesn t hold a candle to a Chick Fil A sandwich an establishment that I make a point to visit anytime I m in a city that has one it s the closest thing I ve come across Oh and their hot fudge sundaes are the best sundaes I ve had ever I d take one over a fancy version prepared by some high end restaurant any day 
-AaaPA8I1jE8-7M99pho2g Harvard Do burgers get better than this I really like all the different topping combinations they ve got and the burgers are almost always cooked correctly to order Add to that some of the best frappes in the Boston area and this place is a winner I would give them 5 stars but there are a couple things that I don t particularly care for cash only seriously onion rings they re too greasy and have no flavor the wait especially when it is cold no bathrooms 
-aeMhY03z88dS1EmTLIBIQ Harvard Delicious I came here with a friend and neither of us could decide on what to get so we decided to split The Whole Nine Yards which is a sampler plate of nine of the restaurants top dessert items I honestly don t think I can pick a favorite of the nine items They each had their own unique character and some had interesting flavor combinations It s a bit pricey and it took a while for us to get our desserts but for the quality of desserts prepared on our plate it was well worth it It was art You can t rush art 
-Aka1qQw_89C9FZYOo3hWA Harvard I have been here several times and would definitely go back as the food is delicious and that can usually trump any other small issues that one may have with an eating establishment However the service is not amazing sometimes I felt like they forgot about my table Also I have been on a Sunday for their brunch and I had the eggs benedict which was great however don t go if you don t want your brunch interrupted by the sounds of some Harvard mens acapella group I know it s supposed to be fun and kitschy and all of that but I guess I m not old enough to appreciate or enjoy being sung to by a barbershop quartet while I m trying to enjoy my eggs It was just annoying 
-aKI6fKZyutLUOSLPYv-FQ Harvard Shaped like a double wide old train car diner and styled like the 1950s in outer space VG packs its punches in hip friendly waitstaff cool d cor and most of all blast off out of this world delicious space food that s light years away from Tang The diner specializes in vegetarian vegan versions of classic diner fare such as a facon B L T grilled seitan and greens and Vegetable Tofu pot pie In the end I couldn t decide on one entree so I ordered a smattering of sides including the soup special of the day Caramelized Onion Soup The soup ended up tasting rather eggplant y and the consistency was thicker than I d hoped It would have been better with cheese but still it was pretty tasty Most of the menu is vegan or has a vegan option available Hash was my next epicurean adventure The hash came with salty diced potatoes and spicy seitan It was my first time ever getting to try the diner standby I loaded it up with ketchup and sriracha from their cute little racha saucer and it was delicious My last dinner item was a black pepper biscuit yet another item that I was thrilled to see on the menu VG s pepper biscuits weren t exactly Southern style but smothered in butter or some butter like substance they were moist and damn delicious One qualm though with this and with the lemon merengue pie vegan merengue Yes How the eff did they do that the prices did seem a little overinflated to me 2 95 for a single biscuit 6 50 for a smallish piece of pie Knock these off by a dollar or half and a little more old school charming diner cred would be bestowed But everything was so good I can forgive the inter stellar aliens this Still 5 stars for ingenuity Full review on my blog Thoroughly Modern Milli Vanilli http bit ly nedozu 
-amQDs2YXYvQE7iNIU_iPA Harvard it is loud in here but it s a great atmosphere for a fun dinner with friends or a birthday dinner the chips and salsa are great to start the meal the queso dip and guacemole are also tasty my friends and i always split the fajitas once you re done eating here you will be majorly full it s a lot of fun to just go and have some margaritas and some laughs very friendly speedy service my favorite mexican place in the area 
-AnasHXEOhpP4_nX0jg9Pg Harvard The crowd here is old white and middle upper class So if that s your type go for it I ve had some tasty things here but it s too expensive and touristy for my tastes For good food go For great food that s unique go elsewhere 
-aroga1adii0-Hx2SrsUeA Harvard so this was my NYE destination for better or worse so the food was good but not worth 85 for a pre fixed meal and the portions were a bit skimpy as in my friend ordered the scallop and her plate had a single scallop on it but the lavendar martinis are so good granted prob not what i needed after consuming several bottles of champagne but tasty from what i remember our server was nice hell she put up with 5 kinda drunk girls i think i d go back on a regular night and try it again 
-AzEmf85_sQB2LLrW0V57w Harvard In the never ending quest for good sushi in Cambridge we decided to give this place another whirl especially since it seems the highest rated option this side of the river according to my fellow yelpers We had been here before and the experience wasn t remarkable except that at the time they didn t serve beer or wine just sake Since it didn t stick out as bad in our memory it wsa time for a second chance sitting down to the menu of 60 70 custom maki rolls just was astonishing and spicy on every other one made my mouth water Maybe just maybe this will be the new place a ritual sushi retreat during summer evenings the shumai that came started things right and the 4 rolls chosen really sounded bang on then we realized that there can be a problem with rolls that all describe items that are on top and other items that are inside sometimes too much is too much spicy tuna and grilled scallops on top of a shrimp tempura roll it s just too much shit going on in every bite sushi is supposed to taste light fresh almost crisp this stuff came across as messy and just downright busy that would warrant about 3 stars But I have to ding the place one star because of the swarm of fruit flies at our table that s a little too much summer eating for my taste moving on 
-B8W-2FQQFdcd9A3DfJsxA Harvard It s a default go to for me Consistent and a crowd pleaser Relaxed easy no fuss but delicious Simple yet creative I like to start with the arugula salad and I highly recommend the rosemary potato pizza Plenty of beers or wines to choose from but nothing overwhelming Service has always been up to par and location is ideal 
-bAyURpIqAdPK-Dj9gyQ6w Harvard IHOP doesn t really come that high in my book I mainly remember it as that place that my dad liked to take us for Sunday brunch only to find out that everyone else s dad was just as lazy Nowadays if I eat breakfast most of the time I get up too late for it to happen I mostly cook for myself but there are just some times when that isn t an option Finding your sleep schedule completely night shifted and waking up just after midnight in the middle of January is one of these times Fortunately this IHOP by virtue of being open late enough for my friends to form a food mob at midnight gains my sympathy It s a haven in a storm where by haven I mean a place that serves halfway decent food that at this time of night isn t absolutely sketchtastic Let s be honest here IHOP is a chain restaurant The menu is the same over the whole country I can go ahead and say that this particular incarnation of IHOP isn t as bad as they come The food is decently cooked at indecent hours of the night and though there are better deals out there the prices won t kill you To its credit this IHOP is spanking clean probably because it s one of the newer establishments in the area As with any chain restaurant of this type you get what you pay for it s a cheap eat and the service is correspondingly unresponsive You probably don t want to deviate too far from the set menu In the end IHOP is at best a run of the mill place While it s the best option for a late night food mob if you go by there during the day my personal recommendation is pay 5 extra for your meal and head to Takemura which happens to be right underneath and far more worth the trouble of eating out 
-BaziKbN5XU9IgTMDnzSpg Harvard Just so people don t go looking for it this place has been gone for at least a year now it was in the spot that Saladworks currently occupies 
-Bcxvkg2dhfnQ5BPraZeRw Harvard A bit of a cave but great people great food great value Classic spot 
-BF4nyT3pNGOOUVTkK0Kpw Harvard Charming decor wonderful cocktails delicious fancy food with comforting Southern influences Hungry Mother is our new favorite restaurant in Boston We came without a reservation and got seated in the bar area immediately We started with the creamy spicy pimiento cheese and the decadent fried oysters The fat juicy oysters perfectly balanced by crisp batter arrived at our table hot from the pan accompanied by a refreshing kohlslaw which I took to be coleslaw made from kohlrabi It was the best part of our meal The tender fried catfish with andouille and hoppin john I love saying hoppin john put up tough competition though After a minor scuffle over who got to order the catfish my gracious boyfriend settled on the chicken perfectly cooked with crispy skin wonderful veggies and scrumptious pan juices Portions are not large here and we ended the night with coffee and the lemon chess pie with caramel and buttermilk ice cream Very sweet yet still delicious 
-bflVORq8NKbwKLk0gpStA Harvard Mary Chung seems to be a solid choice for Chinese food when you re out and about in Central It s nothing extraordinarily stellar to write home about but it s reasonably priced centrally located and extremely edible I came here with some friends around 6 on a Friday night before heading to MIT to see a play and we were able to be seated right away The service was decent again nothing stellar but nothing to really complain about We had the Hot Platter for an appetizer which is really just an assortment of friend things It was nice to nosh on but I ll admit I m not enamored of fried foo as a rule I had the Moo Shi Vegetable which was definitely served with ample plum sauce and plenty of pancakes And while it was tasty I did find myself wishing I d ordered it with some meat In the past I d had their General Gau s chicken and it s definitely yummy So maybe I ll go back to that next time Word of warning Their spicy noodles I think it s the dun dun noodles are veeeeeeeery spicy So be prepared Oh and they re cash only which is good to know before walking in Overall if I lived closer I d definitely order from them more often and if I m in the area I may choose this place but for now it s gonna stick on the list of places that are possibilities and will not likely be making a pilgrimage to Central just for this place 
-BiUUCcXRX_Ktp2kdlm2xA Harvard This has always been one of our favorites in the Boston area Not the usual style dim sum that most folks are accustomed to but a more savory Northern Chinese style cuisine Eating here has always left us satisfied 
-BKbLY-4q92XoKUf3gkoWw Harvard Good for a fancy date A bit expensive but very good 
-bL5h_AzlT9gzYVSdNhaEQ Harvard I ve been back many times since I first posted a review most recently last week the food has been consistently excellent It would be hard to improve upon the skillful attention given to both the food and the service and I enjoy spending time in the bar area or in either of the warmly cozy dining rooms I just wish they had more seating because the place fills up fast I think you can t go wrong trying anything on their menu I m going to sing the praises of their house drinks one in particular 43 made from rye port bitters and maple syrup has a smooth subtle complexity that I can still recall a week later A darkly sophisticated unmistakably grown up drink that also happens to be quite delish Edit more love They will do take out although that s not the focus of their business I can get the boiled peanuts to go and they are sooooo yummy Yay 
-BLJ4y1BCSgWC7Ub9i_P8A Harvard If you just go for the cocktails and the bar food you ll be fine For dinner go across the street to Salts or to Craigie or to Rendezvous But definitely have fun at the bar at Cuchi Cuchi 
-bluwNZ3BwPjthfrP_00HQ Harvard I love Miracle of Science on nights when the music is really great like tonight and Annie is working The food is very yummy the Coke was ice cold and the margarita did the trick I ve only been here twice and see it only as 5 star worthy The cherry on top the menu Periodic table Very select But well worth it 
-Bp4Vl1Rkyaorp1pHtKN2g Harvard I saw Matthew Good on Saturday at Middle East Such a great show I ve been to my fair share of venues and this space is amazing Great sound small and intimate a bar on each side and even places to sit And clean bathrooms The restaurant is absolutely great too I could sit there and hang out for hours Such a great vibe My boyfriend and I both vegan had dozens to choose from Which is very rare most of the time They also clearly mark what is vegan and what is not The menu is mostly of the Middle Eastern cuisine duhh but they have some sandwiches and a veggie burger and fries if that s not your thing The food was really reasonable and pretty good I got the vegetable coucous a little bland but hey it s coucous The hummus and tabloule were soo good 4 50 blue moons what These New Yorkers were in heaven Our server Sonia was really great Very attentive and she kept the table stocked with complimentary pita bread and hey it is free pita bread stop complaining people And we even annoyingly split the check with 4 credit cards and she didn t mind at all I would absolutely come back here for drinking eating hanging out seeing a show This place is kinda perfect 
-bpGnoc4c7R2nvCoGYe1Rw Harvard Henrietta s table is an elegant place to eat well prepared food The menu has a New England slant The food is uniformly hearty and fresh made with wonderful ingredients Even the bread is terrific Prices are a little high Service is very good Parking is awful be prepared to use the hotel lot or take the T 
-bPIneXmxPkK2iO_4feyfQ Harvard I still can t figure out why this place is called Thailand Cafe when it has such great Chinese food Whenever my friends visit me in Cambridge I take them here to give them a taste of real spicy Sichuan food They don t have a very big selection the only downside to me but of the ones they have all of them are very well prepared Service can be a little slow but the ladies are very helpful Once I had a dish that was too salty and they offered me a free new dish 
-bQImkD3rBoNGWGzrtDHCQ Harvard I went to Daedalus on the evening before the annual Harvard Yale football game so I probably had an atypical Daedalus experience First it was packed but with awkwardly old people By that I mean guys whose pale pattern baldness give further evidence that they might be too old to be drunkenly yelling at the bartender and calling each other bro But that aside Daedalus was relatively pleasant Since it was too packed to sit inside we opted to go out onto the roofdeck even though it was practically freezing I was really happy to discover that they had a bunch of these large heating lamps so we were much toastier than expected They also had a good selection of hard cider I recommend getting a bottle of Original Sin 
-bUZppH9XZP4kWpg2LMjTQ Harvard I ve been twice and never ate fresher or tastier food 1st time a la carte second time a pescetarian tasting menu amazing Farm to Table What more can I say I mean octopus that was as tender as a white fish or salmon and I thought I didn t like octopus I could talk all day 
-bWRRrcSg1m4wN5YVuvgug Harvard I ve eaten inside and out upstairs technically that s the Enormous Room but it s all the same team and down and CK is a good place to have close to home They just made the outside option a reality like 2 weeks ago and when the weather isn t too hot it turns out to be a great place to sit and drink and eat Every dish you get here will be heavily salted including passed apps for functions at Enormous but I love salt perhaps cause it makes me want to drink and I love to drink I do need to throw a small demerit for chronically inadequate salad options That it is next to Rainbow Alley aka Candyland Smack Pass TagLab is a big plus for those of us who are artsy by inclination Really good graffiti and a good place to hang for a smoke Also you d expect the Alley to smell a lot more like urine than it does Not sure how much CK contributes to keeping unsavory aromas of that sort in check but it lends a much greater sense of hygienic cred when a place can so tastefully dispense food in such immediate geographic proximity to what should naturally be hotspot of fermenting urban stink CK as woman classy and dignified in frequently unpleasant surroundings Makes your mouth water for more when you get a taste Knows some good tricks plus she ll gladly send you upstairs to hang with her sister if you re into that sort of deal She s seasoned rather than young and fresh but she s still got her figure and knows how to use it Plus she s recently developed a taste for action outdoors when weather permits so she continues to be open to new experiences 
-bwx9-WR2nQBBzdRHEzmSg Harvard Went there with family on st patricks day Real good meal and the beer was great 
-bXCoiZZ0OaZ5LzClpWsGw Harvard I have loved Rendezvous since it opened and come here all the time I ve never had a bad meal the cocktails are delicious the ambience fantastic and the owners seem like super nice people who really enjoy food However One star had to be deducted for the male bartender I believe his name is Brian While I have never experienced anything but impecable friendly attentive service from everyone else at this restaurant he has always been rude inattentive and poorly performed his job The first time this happened I thought maybe it s an off night we all have them The second time I also let it slide However it happens everytime I ve sat at his bar As I have bartended myself my standards are pretty lax keep my beverage filled ask me if the food is okay and say thank you when you drop the check and you re guaranteed over 20 I understand if you re busy but don t chat with the person next to me for 20 minutes and ignore the fact that yes I would love a second glass of wine There really aren t any excuses for service this bad particularly when one is dropping over 100 on a meal It s enough to make me not go back but I ll probably just find nights he s not working and frequent Rendezvous then 
-BZSBtvJ2UMi99TKCkmylQ Harvard Food was good you get to make it yourself The first time I went to this place I really liked it because of the novelty However once I went to this place another time for a creative night out it really didn t get me going Despite all of he choices they all seem to be limited to either an asian or a north american style of eating I wound up being unimpressed the second time Also the service could be better and the menu could be more accurately priced it s structured somewhat oddly 
-BZuj6ugqJhnfWXcDPGiVQ Harvard after TWO WEEKS of calling leaving messages etc i was finally refunded the overcharge not one call was returned not one NOT OK even if it were a 10 overcharge and this was a 72 overcharge 3 times the bill amount totally unacceptable 
-c2yO-V_t6Ro6oKFvCzYeQ Harvard Ok I very rarely write a negative review but since this establishment has gotten so many great ones I might as well do the buyer or eater beware Or at least be one of those I have only eaten here once and you will know why and the food here was pretty good I have had better from other diners before namely in chicago but it is a pretty decent place if you are around the neighborhood and you can t think of anywhere else to go and you are in the mood for diner food Now the bad part I came here on a pretty dead day and wandered in having read all the great reviews on facebook People seem to have a thing for the Simpson s decor and loved to mention it When I first walked in I honestly looked around and raised a brow honestly surprised Ok Its not exactly decorated fully in Simpson gear it has a few things here and there but when I think of a place filled to the brim with Simpson memorabilia I think of it as toys crawling in every nook and cranny in the most obscene manner So if you are a newcomer and are used to old school diner with a certain theme obsession take the Simpson decor comments with a grain of salt There is not that much That honestly isn t what knocked down the stars hough and I forgive the establishment for the lack thereof i m not a big fan of the Simpson s anyway The biggest hit and the reason why I have given only two stars is a the food was pretty good but When closing the door of the shop since it was getting a bit chilly a layer of black dust settled across my food and my coffee At first I thought it was black pepper that somehow got blown all over I like to give people the benefit of the doubt but when I saw exactly where it was and it was EVERYWHERE not just on my immediate spot but on the register and etc I immediately felt sick to my stomach I ve eaten at pretty greasy diners and this one definitely takes the cake But not in a good way So sorry Sunny Greasy dirty diners are cool in my book But not when they are so dirty that a layer of dirt settles over my food and coffee when a slight breeze flutters in 
-C3MyZBUSR75wKE8RIkGAQ Harvard Oh the yuckiness of this place where to begin Since it s a shabu shabu joint let s start with the broth Our large ish group ordered 3 different broths all of which looked suspiciously the same like cloudy dishwater The overwhelming flavor of each was salt I think they dissolved some bouillon cubes in some hot water and served them as miso regular and a third variety that I m blanking on at the moment perhaps because the memorable flavor was salt That ought to be enough to put you off this place But in case you still think Shabu Square might have some redeeming qualities that could merit checking it out in person please allow me to further disabuse you of that sadly mistaken idea Their spring rolls were hard and tasteless again all I remember is saltiness Their lighting is harsh they don t serve alcohol and their waitstaff while friendly has such a poor grasp of English that ordering will be a tortured process of repetitions menu pointing and wondering if you ll get what you actually tried to order In short Do Not Go Instead go to Shabu Ya around the corner A world of difference 
-c9ToJ6MKmEUZ_PX1m46aA Harvard I don t know why this place has such high reviews Such a high distribution of 4 and 5 stars for something that wasn t that great I came here for a quick lunch and ordered the Hot Chick with a 2 combo onion rings and a soda Amused by the puns calling their chicken sandwiches chicks but that aside this sandwich could have been a lot better What I got was a pretty flat chicken sandwich which a smooched chicken filet in the middle amidst all the blue cheese I had asked for the crispy chicken but when I got it it was pretty soggy I guess the hot part of hot chick was meant to be spicy but it was pretty mild in my opinion The onion rings were pretty interesting They had a smooth crunchy batter rather than the grainy crunchy batter most places have They were pretty good and the rings were quite large A nice side to a not so nice burger This place was eh and if I find myself in the area will definitely look for another burger joint 
-cBciG6C2FCrWTSXY3fKTg Harvard I went here a couple of times in the week that it opened it was pleasant calm peaceful with free and easy WiFi with good mellow music in the background and all around a nice place to study read or have coffee lunch with someone Now it s incredibly overcrowded loud not just people the music is SO LOID chaotic with WiFi that only works half the time and all around headache inducing atmosphere True Crema Cafe has a great decor and nice intimate feel but it s always at max capacity making it difficult to get around means withing in 3 4 person long lines for the bathroom means waiting 10 15 minutes for a basic and still not have a place to sit They do make good sandwiches though but I d only stop in if you have an extra 15 minutes to spare and take it to eat elsewhere It s a great concept and I love the design of the place However it s incredibly popular I d recommend only coming at off peak hours just after opening or before closing 
-CBXg1kGREhTdJ_kItkiyg Harvard This place is nothing to rave about but you can t beat there happy hour prices 1 2 all food 4 7 p m everyday Loved the cheese fondue for two but it is really meant for about six people 
-cDK3b2VQN_w5u4zILr5Nw Harvard This is kind of a standard cocktail lounge in Harvard Square But it s a place you end up going multiple times because there aren t many options like it in the Square but also because they do everything decently well I came here for a party We were all seated in the back in a semi private room which was great There were long tables and chairs against the walls and plenty of seating room To be honest it was a great set up for this party I can t speak to the price since I didn t pay but the drinks were pretty decent and standard and the food fare was about the same As one of the few options it does the trick 
-CF19B0_N_a2DNQixj0Zog Harvard Love the soul night Eclectic mix of people eccentrically dressed and unpresumptuous People come to get down I feel unity on soul nights Also love the queerish whatever goes nights Fruitcake is the bomb Where has it been The other Tuesday nights are just as Rad Just last week one of the front door bouncer do it all ladies helped my friends out Some semi drunk dude came dancing up behind one of my friends She was sort of unaware However i was not because she is my ex and I am protective Super Bouncer lets call her interjected in a casual way and pulled him aside to check his ID I later on thanked her She then later on stopped by and whispered that he was probably on his way out as he was increasingly annoying other around him and was a bit too drunk She said to just let her know if he was a problem and he would get the boot It was very nice of her I ve been ah missing manray ever since it closed years back This place brings back a little of the fun I used to have there Plus duuuurty Central which is cleaning up btw is just so fun and random p to the s the decor is chill and relaxing While waiting for my friends to arrive I picked up a Pheonix and a draaank and cozied up on the couch under red lights that make you feel warm and want to stick your tongue out at passersby outside cause your all cozy and there all not in the winter atleast PaDoW 
-CiNx1QwNluOzhCjqkUI1w Harvard Cuchi Cuchi is the perfect restaurant for special occasions or drinks with the girls Their cocktail list is so extensive that it makes it impossible to choose I ve sampled about half of their menu and I can honestly say that there hasn t been a single drink that I haven t enjoyed The food is to die for The stuffed artichoke is my absolute fav It can get a little pricey for 2 people probably 2 4 plates is necessary So on The ambiance well it s just perfect You have to go and least see it once words do not do it justice I secretly want to work there just so I can dress up like the waitresses Whenever I go with four or more people probably 10 tops I request the LED table It s super fun and everyone winds up loving it 
-CLbDoW-76hsZqx-KwajwA Harvard Yuck Nasty greasy burgers and fries 
-cMVpVxdNYHK1PDOI1cLOA Harvard This is my favorite sushi restaurant so far and I eat here way too often for my budget The sushi is fresh and delicious and there are some really unique combos though so far I ve only tried the uni avo roll and the philadelphia rolls and one with grilled salmon all so good that I doubt I ll ever get to try the rest of the menu There are good veggie options too The service is friendly and professional the decor is attractive and the music is great Also you can have your choice of sitting Japanese style or American style 
-CnlR2h_4idIGA8214zt5A Harvard Wow what a perfect place right in the heart of harvard square This is a nice classy place with an excellent drink selection and awesome food I had a burger that was juicy and perfect The people I was with were raving about how good their pizza chicken and perogis were This is a nice clean and classy place to grab dinner and get some drinks They have a late night menu too making this the perfect harvard square destination 
-cnujBK1eX8MhpezK3vnlQ Harvard Always fun and always a good meal despite the wait and parking issues Don t wear your favorite jacket though because it will smell like Mexican food for a long time after And go easy on the free chips they are addictive and filling 
-CO-LgRKDYFegvYRmsAWnw Harvard This is my pizza of choice in Harvard Square 1 They must give you a quarter of the pie for the slice 2 There are yummy slice of the day specials 3 They serve beer 4 Free lemon water 5 Consistent service with a smile I wish they would stay open later Thursday through Saturday because that s prime post drinking meal time Stumbling here for a night cap and thin crust slice would be the perfect end to a Harvard Square rendezvous Finally today I forgot my credit cards and cash at home I only had my Crimson Cash ID card which they don t accept However they went beyond the call of duty as a pizzeria when they comp ed me a slice I will return to pay for my barbeque chicken slice yummm and again to savor all the other special slices Thanks Upper Crust 
-COI6q9jiy0e9eik1KLh_Q Harvard I know everyone is raving about the food at this place but I ve only ever experienced the late night bar section of Hungry Mother so this ll be a bar only review Get yourself over to the bar at Hungry Mother It s not as large a bar as Green Street or Craigie but the sheer inventiveness of Heather is astounding When she s not on one of her classic kicks she ll whip up something never before seen in this world just for you based on the vaguest of impressions I like bitter produced a whiskey based cocktail topped off with Stone Ruination Both her and the other bartender I ve had there have also been very solid on the classics on and off menu I really dig their huuuuuge ice cubes great for slowly melting barely diluting your drink while you sip Bar only review I know but I ve tried a number of their bar food items Every last one had an excellent mix of southern and fantastic Fried okra amazing better than fried pickles The cornbread was heavenly only beaten by Trina s in my book The boiled peanuts with sea salt were an excellent take on traditional bar food and not too expensive either It s all made me desperate to make some time to reserve a spot for a real meal there It s all so good Oh and they ll get you discount Kendall Cinema tix if you go early enough in the evening 
-CpCmM1rqxGrO8DjRld1zA Harvard Not as cheap or as good as I was hoping it would be from the look of it You know those places that look like total hidden gems This had that air being in the back of a little Indian grocery but didn t really meet my expectations It was about 8 50 for a masala dosa I think they are about 6 at Punjabi Dhaba where they are also better The dosa itself was entirely average It was enjoyable enough but not at all memorable and the filling didn t have a whole lot of flavor I m far from a masala dosa expert but of the few I ve had this wasn t the best 
-cpDKufhUGocdSekIdpmLg Harvard I ve been here a lot for leisurely meetings and get togethers Cafe Algiers is a Harvard Square standout for me simply because it s never been too crowded and service is never rushed Which can work both ways you might wait a while for you server but you ll never be pushed out the door either You re free to linger for hours on a pot of delicious mint tea and they ll top off your pot with more hot water if you d like too In addition to the mint tea I recommend the merguez spicy lamb sausage It s made in house and is damn tasty 
-CQDwZ2Bu3l78VCvaFzpaQ Harvard Every time I head in to CBC I like it better and better Fine It s growing on me Great for happy hour Great for weekend lunch on the patio Not so great for tasty food across the board Go for the daily specials to try something unique Popular for beer towers And they have those big growler jugs for 10 a two buck deposit Not bad Typically known as CBC Overall go for the beer tower in the strongest ale they offer In the spring I like their Belgian beer Damn what s it called However taste it before ordering Some Belgians of theirs aren t so great ATMOSPHERE Down home lodge like or something You sort of feel like you re at a brewery Interesting right Well it s got a wooden bar and stools and tables and things Nothing fancy Good for big groups Smells of toasted barley and fermenting yeast BEER Inconsistent I love beer and microbrews especially There are a few beers that I think are great Their standard brews are great but their special brews have their ups and downs i e Belgian style beers don t taste anything like some of the Belgian beers you might get at say Bukoswki s in Inman I can t even give CBC credit for trying Their ambers and lagers and those dark ones are tasty Also I have been a big fan of the Barley wine Why can t you get THAT in a tall beer tower Good choices 1 Red God spring summer super strong hop flavor but it s surprisingly smooth and 8 5 abv 2 Amber Ale all the time is dark but smooth light on the hops enjoyed by many 3 Tall Tale Pale Ale all the time is pale but flavorful FOOD I like the pork chop That s about it I ve tried other dishes the fish and chips is dry the asian spring rolls are sort of tasteless and totally pre made They seem to have a lot of specials so I recommend giving those a shot In a nutshell their menu is constantly changing as of late and I love that 
-CWepnrxh-bhXt6zjv6XFg Harvard I d been wanting to try Upstairs on the Square for a while and used Restaurant Week as the opportunity to do so I seriously wish I hadn t though I think that the only good part about the dinner there was the fun decor The service was just as bad as many of the reviews claim and I ended up eating more of the cold flavorless bread in the bread basket than I wanted to due to the fact that I was starving and none of the food was coming out I ordered the asparagus appetizer sole and lemon cheesecake off of the restaurant week menu and my companion ordered the tagliatelle with bolognese The asparagus appetizer consisted of a maple sugar custard with a few large spears of asparagus and a bit of mesclun The custard was a bit lumpy instead of being creamy and smooth and the asparagus was bland and waterlogged My entree was by far the worst part of the night though The lemon olive oil poached sole with artichoke chips and artichoke a oli that had sounded so delicious on the menu was near inedible The fish had been so overcooked that the consistency was more like mashed potatoes Not exactly appetizing The a oli had separated so there was an oily puddle on the plate and the greens that came with the dish were so soggy and flavorless that I took one mouthful and couldn t eat any more The only semi decent part of this dish was the one lonely artichoke chip that came on the plate it had a nice lemony flavor The tagliatelle with bolognese was the only decent food of the night and I ended up splitting most of that since I couldn t bring myself to eat the fishy mashed potatoes The Meyer lemon cheesecake with roasted pineapples was another disaster The crust was beyond soggy and the combination of the lemon and pineapple made for a seriously odd taste I tried just the cheesy part of the cheesecake without any of the pineapple or the crust and that wasn t half bad but the whole combination was not pleasant I might come back someday to try the tea service in the afternoon hopefully the service is better then but there is no way I would come back for a meal I still can t stop thinking about those fishy mashed potatoes so disgusting 
-cyeo7x6uwRsYsr08X7ECQ Harvard Area Four is the best thing that happened to Kendall Square this year I really like both the bakery and the restaurant Bakery has great selection of coffee cake whoopie pies mocha and red velvet brownies etc The coffee is pretty good and so is the atmosphere I have dined here quite a few times and the mushroom pizza is the best Other things I have really enjoyed are the macaroni cheese baba ganoush when it was on the menu muhammara a cauliflower small plate and the olive oil chocolate cake Every single one of those things were great I hope they continue to one of the best in Cambridge 
-D3Vy7mkOZWgX3RhOrqncw Harvard I started off with a lovely red wine Valle Reale from the Abruzzo region It was the evening s special wine To start I got the seared scallops which were perfectly caramelized and served with a small selection of interesting and unusual greens The waiter helped us identify the marsh samphire and was generally very helpful My main was the duck three ways the confit and breast were excellent but I found the spices to be a bit over powering in the sausage Our table ordered three desserts the lemon buttermilk pudding with huckleberry sauce polenta olive oil cake with honey lavender ice cream and spiced cherries and the vanilla bean panna cotta with mixed summer berries and pistacchio biscotti There was no unanimous favorite The panna cotta was rich and creamy and the fresh berries were an excellent complement The polenta cake was a surprising success The cake itself was a bit crunchy and added an interesting texture to the subtle palette The lemon buttermilk pudding was my least favorite personally although I loved the huckleberry sauce The Italian muscat wine was a lovely companion the waiter helped us identify where to get it either the Wine Cheese Cask in Somerville or Blanchards in Allston The atmosphere was very casual but the decor was still trendy and refined The waitstaff was friendly and helpful we asked numerous questions about the dishes and our waiter sought out any answer he didn t know himself 
-d87ojHd6scx0rxrR3t5cQ Harvard There REALLY needs to be more of these around town It s great to have a healthy alternative to your typical greasy burger joint Their meat is fresh ground sirloin and everything is served on a whole wheat bun Their fries are all fresh cut baked and seasoned They also have the option of fresh lightly sauteed vegetables instead Their milkshakes well more like frappes are amazing and aren t too heavy The place also has wifi so I do my school work here sometimes My only beef is the price is kind of a lot but you re paying for quality in this case Usually a combo with a burger fries and a shake is over 10 which is kind of a lot but not bad when compared to most overpriced delis Also their chicken sandwiches are awfully dry I would stick to the burgers In any given case check it out if in the Harvard area 
-d8zxJCB0xWjQP_PxTKX9w Harvard Me and my townie friend s gummin for lashings of cheap scran since we were so skint from our previous night of arsing around followed by a rough morning involving a shite fall during my run resulting in one banjaxed knee that meant finding an eatin house near my gaff in Central Square VS a Full Irish Breakfast and a short stack of pancakes Full Irish breakfast a wopper bag o shwag of a fry up what brings back the health better than black pudding with a fierce clommel of cloves and nutmeg white pudding filled with suet and oatmeal a deuce of eggs a couple o bangers with beans fried tatos and some toast Suckin diesel man Pancakes complete gobshite and topped with only a screed of banana compote even though the menu made it seem like the star Plus eating them was a fecking dose because they were so crumbly and underdone I didn t want to be a serious neddy though so I declined to send them back Initially we felt completely on our tobler but eventually the usual football crowd dribbled in We didn t want to be a bunch of knackers so I ordered a cup of scaldy and couple of Arthurs rather than some poof juice After I knocked back a jar I relaxed the cacks and joked with the rosspot waitresses who were totally grand and kept the refills coming 
-DBuKOCMzKVGsje7DgOf-g Harvard A lot of potential but it doesn t hit the mark Much better places to grab a beer in the area CBC Lord Hobo The beer list is impressive but like everyone else I swung and missed several times at some great sounding but currently out of stock selections The different measurements for the pour volume is also ridiculous Centiliters Also whoever told my friend to order the pork rinds has a dark sense of humor 
-de8jr_tl5m0EWNyCbEGoA Harvard Decent coffee really good food plenty of space to open your book laptop and space out I had the opportunity to assess the service situation and this is my take The tall skinny moustachio d dude behind the counter appears to be a french american hipster certainly the most insidious species A rare find in the wild they are both rude and judgmental After reading the reviews I came prepared I was hung over wearing sunglasses and my locally ironic cal poly pomona hoodie on I almost felt felt welcome perhaps as much as a half brother would be On a more serious note I think the hipsters behind the counter must be the owners because the lack of courtesy extends beyond what they actually say Am I the only person who noticed that the nicest brightest part of the entire space is the rightmost part of the kitchen 
-dewq6ezYRTgDyCKz8Misw Harvard Wow what a difference a year makes When I lived in Central Square last year this was a run down Burger King frequented by the rougher elements of Central Square Now it s a fancy pants dining establishment that ranks among the best of Cambridge First and foremost the bar Wow What a phenomenal Manhattan Great drinks Our waitress was super friendly and low key which was great Let us take our time which is saying something because it was a Friday night I started with the gnocchi appetizer which as has been noted below is fantastic Perfect for a Boston winter night Dinner was the fish stew which was recommended to me by the waitress I don t recall all the fish that were in there but it was floating in a nice curry sauce with just the right amount of rice and was a treat Great job Only misfire was dessert My wife ordered a strange vanilla flan dish which we just didn t care for Overall a fantastic treat tucked right in the middle of Central Square We ll definitely be back 
-DgERQ1WhNajb6HI1a6sgQ Harvard Had breakfast there today Ordered the My Three Sons and the lox plate Both were huge portions I didn t quite read the full description so I was a little shocked when the most food I have ever seen as one dish showed up 6 1 2 slices of french toast three eggs three slices of bacon three sausage links and home fries A ton of food for 9 99 Unfortunately most of it wasn t very good The eggs were bland the bacon was burnt to a crisp and the home fries were mushy and vaguely sour The french toast was delicious but the syrup was runny and thing The lox plate was ok and had all the trimmings but none of the magic I always leave this place slightly disappointed which is never a good way to start your day 
-dgUfUQjZxSDbdMnfJmdlw Harvard So i ve been here twice now delicious I had a sandwich with their chicken salad with cranberries and apple chunks it was refreshing and not excessive Their house salad dressing is great My boyfriend had a chicken caesar salad which was great the chicken was delish i d recommend this place on a nice day Place your order and sit in the square right outside they bring your food to you so cute 
-DJsyp2kHQJPCQQaDn0USw Harvard The reviews about service are basically on point but I noticed that if you go into Arrow with low service expectations then you ll be pleasantly surprised They aren t going to roll out a red carpet or even engage you in small talk The food is exceptionally average in terms of crepes nothing to rave about but definitely nothing to complain about I had the Amelie bananas nutella and almonds which combined well with the great crepes batter that Arrow uses to make their delicious food So I leave this review like I left Arrow satisifed but meh 
-dkpN7QWdUMA_4zXhJMSQQ Harvard I like the Middle East I go there sometimes to see shows All different kinds of bands play there small local bands and hugely famous ones Sometimes I go there to eat too They have really great hummus It s a little loud though when you re just trying to eat 
-DNk_ogKmfh1VOPTBR1hzg Harvard Hands down one of the worst venues ive ever partied at Yeah the events can be cool but the venue itself is disgraceful Staff are soooooo rude I was trying to be friendly with everyone but all i got in return were bad mannered A holes of a staff team Other than that the music is good but the venue is so grim dull and dirty Toilets are disgraceful unless walking in puddles of urine is your thing The smell inside the venue is horrendous but i guess thats what you expect in a venue full of sweaty people when there is no air conditioners just furnace style heat lol The mid east seems to be trying way too hard to be something its not it reminds me of those old wash up bars you would find your college professors hanging out at There are much cooler places in Boston you can find good music and people at 
-Dp-Q6HU4tvTx6eariof3A Harvard A perfectly fine gastropub in a very convenient location in Harvard Square literally cater corner to the T Portions on the main dishes are generous and the dishes we tried steak frittes and pan roasted chicken were well seasoned Good beer selection and a nice looking variety of pretty bottles behind the bar for what it s worth we re no experts on mixed drinks While the place looks small from the street it is actually ginormous with a second large bar and dining area downstairs 
-DpDUL87VNQwqVDxAuVZlg Harvard About 3 5 rounded up to 4 I went here with a large group For apps I liked the various dumplings and a spicey fried chicken dish Not a fan of their scallion pancake avoid or hot and sour soup not my style For entrees the taiwanese dishes were the winners I didn t particularly care for the standard americanized chinese offerings which most chinese restaurants are obliged to offer Overall a good option for this area if you stick with this restaurant s strong suit 
-DpMnNB7e6-kpPy4FbsjqA Harvard Henrietta s Table gets the bump up to 4 stars because of their great outdoor patio seating I got their Salmon Sandwich with some fresh lemonade both were very good although nothing out of the ordinary They definitely appear to use high quality ingredients in their food A good option in Harvard Square if you re looking for something close to fine dining 
-dv3apx-xbVx5G-kaz0Fjw Harvard The famous Ron Burgundy once said WHAT IS THIS AMATEUR HOUR and no other phrase better describes Shinkansen Bullet Train Teriyaki Normally I wouldn t even bother yelping a place in the MIT student center but after four years I cannot deal with their incompetency anymore If my one star review prevents one poor visiting family or student from eating here then I will have done my duty The teriyaki is pretty bad the service awful the prices high and it s just not satisfying at the end of the meal Yes even their boba bubble tea sucks Even worst they just haven t improved in the four years and I have no reason to believe they will ever 
-dVnRsuu9MfoLgeVk-5O0A Harvard This is the closest pub to my place I m a big fan of their Big Man Ale as well as the pale ale I m not really feelin the Amber They have a decent pub grub menu and respectable bar The growlers are a bit pricey but worth it if you want microbrew freshness 
-DXtJCCHponJAUUwcpVVUg Harvard I came here for a brunch on a cold Sunday morning so can t speak much to the nightlife nor dinner menu However the atmosphere was nice and the food was for the most part good Nothing really blew me away As far as sticking to the them I did notice the regular menu written in period table format on the wall which seems to be the key feature of the restaurant I ll give it to them that was very cool Food was even grouped by themed into the columns and for the most part increased in price as you traveled from the top of the column to the bottom With the exception of the skewers whats up with that guys I ordered the sourdough french toast with grilled banana I was a bit disappointed that those two items were completely separate from one another on my plate and it was only half of a grilled banana which could be rationed over only about 3 4 bites of my french toast So I basically had an order of sourdough french toast It was good but nothing special My boyfriend had the breakfast wrap Again good but nothing amazing The side of potatoes was phenomenal though We were both a bit hungry and the guys at the next table had the egg sandwich which was packed with toppings and looked amazing We ordered a 3rd meal one of those to split and it was quite fantastic I d skip the french toast and order that first if I went back Other items to note the waitress had originally charged me extra for the grilled banana on the bill extra 2 50 before I pointed out it was listed as coming with the dish on the menu She explained it was her first brunch and apologized and corrected it quickly Also the coffee maker was broken and no coffee was available when we arrived at about 10 am on a Sunday I find that unacceptable Go buy a cheap 12 cup maker down the street or buy resell a to go crate of it from dunkin donuts Don t deny your morning customers coffee Oh and the table in the middle of the room seems customized designed and is absolutely awesome Where can I get one 
-DyTws4oZnz0xnVxWcK5PA Harvard Went there this past Sunday evening Was impressed with variety of sushi menu I went with two great friends all were craving sushi and we weren t dissapointed Favorites the pizza roll I initially was ambivalent pizza roll but it had everything texture taste and just so delicious I will definitely go back Only complaint wish they had better assortment of cocktails 
-dz0yFCaj1OJbjBJvTFQog Harvard Over rated and overlooked It s nice for the older fourty plus crowd Bland if u ask me 
-D_845a6GdZkIHsAxtjIKQ Harvard Unfortunately mediocre There are several better restaurants nearby so I m unsurprised the place is frequently empty The food is not outstanding in any way and the service is really indifferent On the most recent visit there was such a problem splitting the check with two credit cards that the cards actually disappeared for more than 10 minutes That kind of thing makes me really twitchy and I don t think I will go back 
-e70zk1eWQ9wHaVK8d4FNg Harvard Mr Bartley s is fun and I take friends and visitors there whenever I get a chance The burgers are made thick not flattened like a baseball on a bun just like I like it I always order a specialty burger and so far I have simply LOVED the ones with ooey gooey boursin cheese The Steve Jobs iBurger is my favorite boursin mushrooms and onions but since the names and flavors change all the time it may not be around forever I prefer the sweet potato fries to the regular fries in my opinion it s worth the extra dollar or so to substitute Mr Bartley s is definitely touristy but the food is good and the atmosphere is fun Make sure you bring cash 
-E78Jv6UIa0EnjVrfi8E5Q Harvard Great service very friendly accommodating prompt etc We had the ramp brebis and focaccia appetizer and it was DELICIOUS I had the paella next and it was good not too salty but for the price I would ve expected a bit more seafood Topped it off with cappuccinos which were also very good I d go back if I were in the area for a nice dinner It s definitely pricey but you pay for the whole experience 
-E7kKvm1gePBYeVrAXrkYA Harvard Shepherd Pie and Fried Chicken Sandwich never fail for a comfort food dinner 
-ebUxNdGR6OBx_wGd_L1sw Harvard The Traditional Irish Stew they quote to be one of this establishment s favorites was by far the worst stew I ve ever tasted the chunks of veggies were as large as golf balls there were perhaps _three_ little fatty and undercooked pieces of lamb and the broth was more or less a stirred ketchup Served lukewarm The waiter spilled some beer while putting it on our table and never bothered to wipe it off and never asked about my untouched meal Take your money and dine elsewhere 
-eGlLAeQ6ZUmAehFPfoRZA Harvard I love this place because the location decor and attitude is so unassuming that the food is shockingly delicious The spicy pad thai is classic Wash it down with a fresh lime soda drink that they make on the spot reminds me of the street side vendors in India The triangular crab rangoon is also a solid choice because it is different from what you ll expect 
-eImY8DmL-bafHrO7PxmSw Harvard For good Indian food in Cambridge look no further than India Pavilion It may be older than many of the restaurants in Central Square but it has not lost its touch 
-EJMCP-rIFBTX7TsE9hrag Harvard This place should be banished to the food court hall of shame Overpriced tasteless pizza brown lettuce and shriveled up cold cuts of the unhealthy variety salami pastrami hummus with a dark patina that shows off its antiquity horrific greasy chicken all located in a most unappealing space The only positives little kids don t care about any of the above and it s easy to get to from the Marriott If you are staying there and need a quick snack you don t need to go outside Nice for some people if it is pouring rain but frankly I d walk up to Central Square or over to Inman Square in a historic hail storm rather than go into this depressing place again With the terrific food trucks right across the street I can t believe this food court stays alive MIT geniuses create a business plan for this place that brings in some healthy well priced local food and a friendlier eating environment This is just a tragedy 
-ejVK2hhjc1u6nLgzRGtMQ Harvard I have gotten and liked Taco with chicken cheese salsa Taco with carnitas chicken salsa Taco with steak chicken salsa Burrito with chicken cheese salsa Quesadilla with steak cheese salsa Quesadilla with steak cheese salsa rice Anna s has turned me into a creature of habit but an oh so delicious habit 
-Ek_xjV6g-2F43OSX_KpvQ Harvard Whoever thought to put mashed sweet potatoes on a breakfast sandwich and then make it a little spicy was a genius I haven t eaten anything else there because I ve only been twice for breakfast but damn that was delicious I will be back next time I m in town 
-EK_yPUCkR1tbLopOPdudQ Harvard So I said to my friend I have a random German guy visiting me for a week and tonight I d like to take him out to pizza But not just pizza you know I want pizza plus plus something something extra And my friend declared Mein freund CAMBRIDGE 1 It was wonderful Great modern atmosphere which was packed to the gills with people You ll definitely have to wait but they manage crowds well On a Friday night at 7 30 PM our group of three had to wait only 20 minutes and even snagged seats at the bar for beers for the wait Nestled in Harvard Square it s a great place to take people from out of town and easily has something on the menu for everyone When we reached our seats placed our orders and quickly got our pizzas we were in heaven Charcoal grilled thin crust pizzas portobello roasted onion and asiago for me killer italian sausage ricotta tomato and fontina for my friend wowwy she said and hot cherry peppers black forest ham and manchego for our German acquaintance he seriously dug it Our waitress was great The house red was great All around great The moral of the story is I m pretty sure any one can enjoy Cambridge 1 which is a something I previously thought was only possible to say about smiles rainbows and kittens So go enjoy Danke 
-eNQZc0QSSXQCfoKWprSvQ Harvard Most gigantic glasses of wine ever The bar is downstairs Not crowded after work 
-ePP7wD6hJpysTKv2hXR6A Harvard Algiers is a well decorate cute and inviting cafe conveniently located in Harvard Sq The top floor was quite and had lots of open seating which was great for studying or reading The service was a bit slow but friendly Unfortunately they served one of the worst latte s I ve ever had It had no foam luke warm milk and weak espresso and it was 4 50 It looked and tasted more like a cafe au late so I asked the server if this was a latte and she said yes hence confirming my worst latte award I m a big fan or local coffee houses don t mind paying for good coffee but this was overpriced for the quality so 2 stars for the ambiance 0 stars for the latte I may come back to try some Arabic coffee since it a very cute charming cafe but I won t be rushing back anytime soon 
-erpUZ0rm4yGQnvLTzm71Q Harvard Pinocchio s is the only place I feel comfortable eating in Harvard Square they are fast reliable and I never feel like I m being cheated price wise because of the location If I don t feel like cooking for a few days I ll stop by and grab a small Sicilian for 22 that will feed me and my fiance for 3 days The guys who work here are friendly and make everyone feel welcome even though they get pretty crowded during peak hours they only have 5 tables As yelpers have noted the Sicilian crust is to die for and if your hunger is average a single slice is pretty filling a meal for me is usually 3 slices shared between me and my fiance The subs are also delicious albeit crazy greasy A few notes you need to buy about 3 slice or a sub if you want to use a debit credit card they have a 7 credit card min and one slice is 2 25 If you re ordering a whole pizza to go you probably want to do it by phone about 30 minutes before you want to pick it up because there s not a lot of room to wait around inside Everything else has been said Pinocchio s is my go to place for cheap greasy delicious Italian street food 
-EuAIf8RB6-NWNBquXnK5w Harvard I think Anna s is one of the Boston area s most overrated taquerias After 4 years at MIT I ve given this place more than enough opportunities to redeem itself but I m still unsatisfied I ve tried just about everything from the burritos to the tacos to the rice plates to the chips and dip I will say that the guacamole is delicious and I love their Mexican drinks horchata and jamaica Those are definitely worth trying They also have refreshing lemonade but recently it seems like they have been using that cheap artificial lemon flavor So sad The meats are usually bland and if not bland super fatty I thought al pastor was supposed to be super fatty and greasy until I spent my summer in Mexico City The real stuff is well seasoned and pretty lean Nonetheless I will admit that Anna s is filling It s the kind of meal you can scarf down in 5 mins run back to class or work and be nourished for half the day But it s not that tasty and you ll probably feel gross and bloated afterwards 
-EybfJNQFABxV0IlAoqXBQ Harvard this place has a really fun and mod interior design theme going on inside i didn t try the sushi but the korean food was great i had chap chae and the bulgogi both were fantastic 
-e_10FRrGMI4S4zWBF5Fjg Harvard On a Friday or Saturday evening there is often a long wait and they do not take reservations One tip I can offer you is that is you tell the bartender you want to eat a meal at the bar they will give the seat to you before a drinker by placing a reserved sign over the newly emptied seats The real draw of this place is the bar and their extensive eclectic cocktail list I got a drink that was muddled strawberries with basil and vodka it was very good I was most impressed by the crowd that goes here it made for some great people watching The decor is also very cool most of the staff is dressed in extravagant clothing from the early 1900 s What holds this place back a little bit is their food While not short on creativity there were some great dishes and others that just didn t work as well That shouldn t steer you away the food is still better than most places Here is what I had Bread Basket You have to pay a few bucks for it but the bread is great comes out warm and has olive oil for dipping Seafood Avocado One of the highlights It is basically a cerviche served inside a hollowed perfectly ripe avocado with a side of lobster tail Sizzling Garlic Shrimp Pretty much what the title says The shrimp themselves were on the smaller side This actually also makes a great dipping sauce for your bread Cuban Cigar Short rib inside a filo dough roll It does strangely resemble a cigar It is served with a bean salad It was good but wasn t crazy about the spices they use on the short rib Thai Mussels Not a fan of these I believe it was the overdose of basil in the broth that was the turn off 
-f6h8vv6Zkc7tT76DvDYMQ Harvard Why did they change their coffee and what happened to the great breakfast sandwiches This was my go to place in the summer great patio seating fantastic coffee and even better breakfast sandwich Between bad weather and other plans this was my first visit this summer I hated the new coffee and the sandwich was just not the same I am deeply disappointed Is there a new owner What happened 
-faApQvYK9OUVIjTcKB52w Harvard This receives the same review as the Faneuil Hall location That s the thing about chains you know what you re going to get in terms of quality regardless of location on average The thing that I liked a little more about this location than the F H one less tourists I heart wagamama I have never repeat never had a bad experience when visiting a wagamama The servers all assist one another so you are well taken care of The food has always been good I would lick the plate clean if that were acceptable behavior and there are a good number of things I like on the menu One downside to Wagamama is that it has group seating They are going to seat your party of however many people next to other parties on picnic style benches If that sort of thing bothers you then you re not going to be comfortable and it will ruin your dining experience Speaking of the tables they have these place mats on them and the servers take your order and write the down on your placemat The first time I came here I was caught a little off guard by this but whatever if that s their thing doesn t bother me All I care about is that my food is brought to me in a decent amount of time it s made well my service is friendly and I feel like I received a good value and Wagamama delivers on those items 
-FHAMHazFhFCMabWSAJsfA Harvard Alright I m going to risk contradicting the crowd this is one of my favorite pubs Although I do agree that I was a little shaken by the Norse name referring to an Irish Pub You d think that someone opening a restaurant would do a little research and at least get the correct culture I like the decor It feels very comfortable warm and inviting I ve chatted up most of the bar staff and once you get them going it s a pretty friendly group There s plenty of seating although the place is always packed on a weekend evening and seating is generally not available at those times I even managed to train one of the senior bartenders in one of my favorite drinks that no one ever knows how to make he did a great job There have been several drinks that the bar was not equipped to make in spite of the fact that the bar seems very well stocked but the bar manager is always willing to offer solutions compromises and alternate recommendations As far as my general bar experiences this place is the best of all the spots in the Boston area that I ve visited so far The food is another point worth mentioning Everything that I ve tried at the Asgard Irish American fare has been above average tasty The portion sizes are also large I m always on a quest for good Shepherd s Pie and the stuff here is the second best I ve had the best sadly being at a bar in Dorchester The chili is average to good many of the deserts are awesome just good food The Asgard also claims to have live music from time to time on the weekends but everytime I ve been in on a weekend the band was unable to play for some reason lead singer sick etc So I ve gotta disagree with many of the people who have posted here the Asgard is definitely worth a stop whether you re looking for good food good bartending or a comfortable atmosphere 
-fHUP6HAu8oEjAhj0kgqmA Harvard Visited this establishment a while back and thought it had a really nice atmosphere and great service but unfortunately my food experience was a little disappointing At least half of the dishes I had on my tasting menu were not cooked well or were underwhelming I had really looked forward to the six course tasting here having heard so much about it In many ways I was impressed We had technically more than just six courses if you count the lovely jasmine infused panna cottas that were complementary I may have had an irregular experience but tastings aren t things I can afford to try multiple times at the same place if my experience the first time was mediocre I really loved the salad and desserts but am terribly disappointed by the pork belly It was unbelievably salty The same can be said for the other meat dishes and makes me wonder if I just got the bottom of the pot they did say at first that they ran out Aside from the meats I did thoroughly enjoy the unique flavor and pairings of the other dishes but being a meat lover not having a well flavored meat dish put quite the damper on my evening 
-FHYkx_9einYF1D-PqsTyQ Harvard This restaurant is worth every dollar you spend there Fine dining at it s absolute best in Cambridge The place is spotless intimate cozy warm inviting the staff treat you as if you are coming into their home The food is prepared as art and cooked perfectly I had a wonderful birthday experience here my boyfriend and I devoured everything on our plates and excitedly shared bites If you re looking for a place for a special occasion and you prefer a small intimate local hidden jewel type of experience this is it 
-FOXn4xDZUNNwxxXuITlgQ Harvard I walked past green st grill 3 times before i found it really This is the place ok well lets see 3 tacos on wednesdays spending more on drinks than you do on food Hoping this doesn t sound alcoholic its just a that great of a deal 
-FPHe2FGgL05LTs3KW5SXw Harvard very good shawarma though they lack the fries of greek corner II which is pretty sad 
-fUONiIWlE4giFVYLiMkYQ Harvard That s it I m doing it I m entering the fray of the burrito wars And I m casting my vote firmly on the side of Chipotle I freely admit though that I don t eat a lot of meat so my comparisons are all based on the vegetarian options My first of many burrito experiences started as many do at Anna s I was hooked But after awhile the surliness of the staff wore thin at least let me answer about what I want before you start slopping things on there So I moved on to Boca Grande And it was good And then it wasn t quite as good I wanted something fresher And lo there was Chipotle The guac oh the guac It s creamy and has just a slight tang of lime and they make it fresh all day so it s actually green not a sad faded brown looking at you Boca G I ve tried three locations and the Harvard Sq one has the best burrito rollers hands down Dedham is hit or miss and Brighton Cleveland Circle are second tier at best The tasty ingredients make up for a lot though I like the hot salsa although if you re used to a lot of heat I am it s not really that hot but it has a great flavor I think their pinto beans have some meat in them so I go for the black beans and I ask them to go light on the rice because sometimes they mound it on there 
-FWPnaJOytxCTOor7Ym5WQ Harvard Location is fantasic for people watching The inside is sleek and nice with a decent beer selection The menu is a bit different and the service was quite slow considering we were there on a Saturday afternoon and there were only 3 other tables with people at them The food was alright but I really don t think I would go back The idea is there but something is missing 
-g2eijeYC-e8gxScAoZQ8g Harvard My girlfriend and I had been craving Indian food for some time The cravings came in waves and this time it found us while we were walking around leisurely in Harvard Square So into Tanjore we went It was a weekend around 6 00 PM and the place was completely empty Not to be deterred we sat down and ordered our usual boring Indian choices Chicken Tikka Masala and a Combo Plate The food was as Yelp describes 3 stars A OK The sauces were a bit too sweet and the chicken should have been more tender Awesomely enough though the leftovers were super delicious the next day straight out of the fridge I also seem to remember from my times as a student that the menu was split into regional Indian cuisines North Indian South Indian and some other regions I m sure I have it all wrong but there were no longer these divisions on the menu I d suggest trying elsewhere for better Indian food 
-g5-IZmskOsEZ4oksElIfg Harvard The Mexican Cajun mix was interesting Salsa was not the best I ve had but the attentive server kept it coming with warm chips till the food arrived quite quickly I might add I enjoyed the Jambalaya as a side to my enchiladas and both were executed quite well The house frozen Marg hit the spot no need to upgrade Tasty meal decent price great service 
-G74BD64Cug7Igh7qx_Jdg Harvard Cheapest double burger and brew in the City 10 done and done Good fries too Only bad thing limited seating gets pretty packed The server also tried to short change us once which was pretty annoying But overall I really love this place Parking is TOUGH though and the lot next door even w validation is 12 00 even if you re only there an hour The staff is also awesome b c I left my wallet there didn t realize till the next morning frantically raced over to get it and they had it all contents present and accounted for ps there s seating upstairs too if downstairs is crowded 
-g9PIlPwsHAuFa8rFqVprA Harvard Any five star review of this place is inexplicable I m guessing the five stars are from either morons idiots or people trying to be ironic There is a special level of hell for perpetrators of this kind of garbage They ll be taking laps in Satan s Olympic sized pool o flames fire and brimstone along with the owners of Cheesecake Factory Applebee s and Dick s Last Resort Let s begin the hatefest shall we The official laundry list of why Border Cafe might be hell on earth 1 It s about 85 degrees in there at all times I like 85 degrees when I m on the beach or on vacation or when I m in a sauna but not when I m getting ready to try to choke down what passes as food at this joint 2 It s so fucking crowded with douchebags people with babies women trying to pick up douchebags and Harvard undergrads trying to get a margarita without getting carded you can t breathe let alone move 3 The margaritas are really sub par Not well mixed Not salted properly And I m pretty sure they use the same margarita mix you can pick up at Stop and Shop 4 Hey waiter guy do you really need to check our IDs again when 1 we are all clearly in our late 20s early 30s and 2 we are still carrying around out shittily mixed margaritas No not really but thanks for making us dig those out again for the umpteenth time that night Really appreciate your thoroughness and attention to detail Too bad you didn t extend such skills to actually getting the drinks we ordered to us C est la vie 5 The food Any place but Boston and this shit on a plate would not be tolerated I don t get it Bostonians are generally known for a few things being assholes liking the Red Sox throwing tea into the harbor and being wicked smart cause we all go to all these fucking colleges in town The last item on the list and heck even the first does not compute with Bostonian love of all bad Mexican food It s like we have a complex we don t think we deserve good Mexican food so we go around eating this shit thinking it s the best we can do We have low Mexican food self esteem Can t we all just agree to go cut ourselves take the angst level up a notch and then demand a fucking good TexMex place in Boston or Cambridge city proper 6 I ve cracked the recipe for their queso dip Go to the Stop and Shop so you can also recreate their margaritas head to the processed cheese aisle pick up a pound of Velveeta throw in a bottle of ChiChi s salsa and set it to nuke in your microwave for five minutes Voila Bon Apetit 7 And don t get me started on their Creole Cajun offerings It s even more offensive than the Tex Mex they throw on your plate 8 My husband while trying to push his way to the bar to get us drinks hears this Hey Brah watch it dude Brah For realz It appears that Brody Jenner and the Bromance crew hang out in the bar area of Border Cafe on Friday nights 9 There is an hour long wait to eat in this hell hole A full 60 minutes Longer if your group is on the large side You can count on 90 minutes for your standing pleasure 10 There s a Tom of Finlandesque cowboy mural on the wall in the basement Oh wait That s kinda awesome Two stars it is 
-gB--s125Sri89WLLdZ6uA Harvard If you want authentic Mexican food go somewhere else but for Tex Mex food in Cambridge Border Cafe if a great place to go It has a pretty fun atmosphere and is great for a group provided you are all there because they won t seat you if people are missing Since you get a big basket of chips and salsa as soon as you get here it is especially good to go with a few extra people The food and alcohol are both cheap especially given its location in the square It does get very crowded especially on the weekends so don t go when you are super hungry I have also been here at times when the service itself is pretty slow They have a pretty good selection of margaritas and I can say that their frozen strawberry margarita is excellent The menu has both Tex Mex and Cajun items and they have a special vegetarian section They give large portions and are willing to do some substitutions I usually get their vegetable fajitas and they are always very good Lots of different veggies and they give you plenty of accompaniments The portions are large and they are very vegetarian friendly 
-GDPLE0vuEohEI3UA1r4lg Harvard Hands down one of the Boston area s best restaurants The menus dinner weekday breakfast weekday lunch Saturday brunch Sunday buffet brunch are all great The setting is a real pleasure with lots of airy open space The staff are friendly and attentive If you ever have time on a weekday morning go to Henrietta s for breakfast Trust me it s not what you would expect from a hotel restaurant You will not want to leave Which reminds me most hotel restaurants inexplicably stop serving breakfast by 10 00 at the latest Henrietta s serves breakfast until 11 00 My kind of restaurant The Sunday buffet brunch is spectacular with oysters on the half shell shrimp cocktail salads vegetables meats eggs a fantastic array of desserts and a lot more 
-GfiIPGdm1XOJeCSVubO7Q Harvard This is a soccer bar Come here if you want to watch soccer and not be bothered by the waitstaff as they seemed very inattentive towards visiting your table or even to bring you your drink The food offerings especially the hamburgers on the menu seemed to be interesting However opting for the buffalo fries instead was a mistake on my part as they were soggy and undercooked and felt as if someone had just thrown some random condiments on a pile of microwaved leftover fries from the night before Furthermore don t expect the rare to the area craft beers on the menu to still be on tap so you ll be stuck with the more standard beer fare at normal to higher than usual prices On the plus side the trivia they offer on Wednesday nights is a decent change from the standard offerings with challenging questions However the trivia hosts lack a real presence and struggle to truly keep the audience engaged as they plug along through questions at a disinterested pace The most obvious sign that this is a place to pass on unless you re a die hard soccer fan was the attitude of our waitress who came over as we were leaving and asked if we were planning on tipping more despite us having left an appropriate 15 amount despite having to go out of our way to get any attention at our table This certainly speaks volumes of the type of service offered here and we will not be coming back 
-gGGwsADkvjaXXHBU9bVPg Harvard Ahhhhhhh I wanna scream I m so excited to tell you about how great this place is Tip 1 when you first walk in check the bar There s always at least 25 mins of waiting for the tables so why not grab a seat at the bar You will get more attentive service that way because the bartenders are always around and you won t loose your cool because of waiting Hands down the best breakfast place in the entire Boston screaming out loud from a Vietnamese that grew up eating noodle soups and banh mi for breakfast Hands down the weirdest decoration that I ve ever seen at a breakfast joint Hands down the busiest breakfast place that can handle their customers with the best service possible Hands down the worst coffee ever but it s okay you can give me their French Toast and Pumpkin pancake and i will be happy as a clam Oh hands down the best French Toast ever I always have trouble selecting what to eat here because there are too many to choose from However the specials on the white board by the bar always help I usually go here with another friend on Sat or Sun morning It doesn t matter what we order we have to share either a side of pancake or french toast otherwise he she will no longer be my friend LOL no not to that extreme Oh did I tell you that drinks here are crazy good as well They have a wide variety of beers drafts and cocktails that I ve never seen anywhere else While waiting for your orders which might take awhile since they are packed all the time you can enjoy all the mock labels at the bar vintage labels that you have not seen since the 70 s 80 s One time our order took more than 45 minutes to arrive which I didn t care because I was talking to my friends about the labels at the bar the entire time The bartender maybe manager offered a 50 discount to make us happy Friendly Toast people are just plain awesome Thanks guys 
-gHO51l5V3qETcDyQUgahQ Harvard Hands down my favorite restaurant in Boston I have been here more times than I can count and the staff is always incredibly friendly and glowing The drinks are classic in nature The wine list pairs almost too well with the menu The beef tongue is mouth watering The french gnocchi is savory The catfish is one of the best prepared fish dishes in the city Also the deserts are worth saving room for un notch the belt one more hole 
-ghVKuA0CsGUu4cnt69ivg Harvard The hostess came by the table 30 minutes after seating us to let us know that there were people coming in after us and that we should be mindful of the time We ignored this comment as it seems somewhat ridiculous and ate a decent but definitely overpriced meal Then as we were waiting for our friend to return from the bathroom the hostess returned to our table to remind us that we had exceeded our two hour time limit and essentially asked us to leave When we confronted them that we had never experienced this type of treatment before the owner came over introduced himself and said I am the owner We didn t know what to say to that He then defended the hostess at one point rolling his eyes at our discontent I have never received service this poor in my life I should also mention that at the beginning of the night when there was a thunderstorm going on three of the people at our table had drops of water land on our shoulder head and hands To remedy this problem they moved our table two feet over after which we continued to feel occasion drops that went ignored 
-Gn8Iaxx9u48PtCboYnFVw Harvard I came by here for the first time on Saturday night for post dinner drinks Despite countless times that I had walked down Mt Auburn St and seen this place I had never actually gone in It s actually a nice place The bar is relatively chill and the bartender was cool his interest was piqued when I started talking about the dollar oysters at McCormick s Schmicks The tap has a distinctively good list of beers including Berkshire Brewing as well as your general standards and it s a nice place Sadly the appetizers seem to end a bit early but other than that I d go back easily 
-gOhsHhqiFYR2COq2TZ1Yw Harvard 5 stars for Roads because it is the perfect place to make memories during your college years I guess there is nothing too special about the bar it s kinda small downstairs has good seating and is a good place to sit and talk Upstairs is loud often crowded with MIT kids darts and a big screen tv The free pizza with each pitcher on Wednesdays is a must The pizza comes out hot and delicious Trivia nights on Sundays is always fun too The music at Roads is actually usually pretty good too albeit repetitive to those who are always there 
-GQrUE7abCeYII3yhQ55iw Harvard Okay so this is my spot for lunch when I take my staff out for reviews My fav plate is the dbbl cheeseburger plate jalapeno poppers and ddbl Lobster roll 11 00 Holy Crustaceans Batman The staff is great Bartenders are friendly and townie beers aahhhh what a selection If you are ever in Harvard Square it is a must that you sop in and get eatin 
-GQu-4Yxnzf17lRRSFBj3Q Harvard So thoroughly mediocre Like nothing I had had any real flavor The hot sauce tasted like heat Thats it No pepper taste no tomato taste it tasted like really watery leftover liquid from salsa with heat added The chipotle mushroom burrito was meh I ate it because I was hungry not because it was good I won t venture back to this MexiCali I d rather go back to Philly where there is a little tiny hole in the wall also called MexiCali that actually serves good food that tastes like something 
-GrbnVs0SB-bhyg4Aa4qqw Harvard I want to like Chipotle hell I like anything that competes with Anna s Taqueria however I cannot in good conscious recommended this place when Border Cafe is less than 100 feet away The menu is incredibly simple Start with the filling beef chicken steak etc Then choose your style burrito hard taco soft taco salad as well as the nonsensical burrito bowl and fajita burrito Fajita burrito Meat rice peppers onion guacamole sour cream cheese if I was at the meeting where they were trying to figure out what to call this contraption I would have suggested a Burrito with no beans Granted I m a dumb consumer I mean it MIT and Harvard aside when it comes to people trying to sell me things I fall for all the tricks Magic Bullet chop o matic yeah I have one Sham wow yeah I have two I would even buy a snuggie the blanket with arm holes if some dude came up to me and had it However I am smart enough to know know that if I don t like beans in my burrito I can order it without them That aside the food just isn t that great Also not that you should care but the inside is all light wood and steel copper giving it an modern industrial look Bottom line Someone out there likes lime rice Just walk the two blocks to Border Cafe If you are too tired I am sure some passerby would be glad to carry you if it meant striking back at Chipotle 
-Gtc7YcG0eqmwnoGbKYgtg Harvard Eh This place is just fine Pretty standard and traditional American food Nothing exciting but definitely eatable Do not come here expecting a fantastic meal There is one huge plus to daedalus the rooftop deck On a spring afternoon or summer evening this place is perfect The wood is beautiful and life feels serene sitting atop Cambridge Come for drinks great mojito 
-GuFea9jqrUb8vBT8CvPUw Harvard Well I guess there is a reason that you go to diners for breakfast and not dinner We live near there and decided to try Zoe s non eggs menu I ordered a greek salad with chicken 10 Pretty much all iceberg lettuce only a few pieces of chicken and a pile of feta cheese I could make a better one myself The service was good though mainly because no one goes there for dinner but I wouldn t go back for dinner ever 
-gwLPBl5L51DjL6V4kPlmg Harvard Although most people go to Sabra Grill for the falafel hummus spanakopita and other Lebanese Mediterranean standards I most frequently go for their delicious lentil soup It s hearty and filling strewn with diced potatoes chopped kale and suffused with a delicate lemon flavor And it s very reasonably priced It s not easy to find good soup in Harvard Square but I can always count on Sabra for deliciously satisfying soup Their falafel is good too 
-gXpiLNaaeNh-X6uN9jxlQ Harvard We stumbled upon this place for lunch since we had an hour or so before our tour of Harvard started and I m glad we did My husband loved the beer and had a huge burger free range organic yummy beef cooked to order I had the steak sliders with roasted peppers and blue cheese which was great We had Boston Creme Pie for dessert because we were in Boston The service was fast and friendly 
-GyVi7zwn8rF3YGHnENK8A Harvard While my personal favorite Bageleria is Finagle a Bagel this one is a close second At Alpine Bagel they ve got fresh bagels everyday and their very own brick oven They make a mean pepperoni pizza Also to add to the zest they ve go a Freshens smoothie place right in their store Alpine Bagel is also located in the MIT student center Great food great prices just watch out for the crowds 
-gZe6GTkp4ZGmp8NfoFyhg Harvard very little behind the counter at flour excites me any more the 3 treats rarely showcase more than average baking skill the 8 sandwiches will hardly satiate my lunchtime hunger and the ancillary offerings like coffee and soup are ordinary more specifically the oreos are easily made at home the ginger peach muffin is not gingery enough the sandwich bread has no character and dear god the ordering then prepping efficiency lacks dearly needed efficiency i instead go for the quiche or stuffed bread where some creativity and seasonality are on display alongside bitter greens and live in a fair 6 neighborhood 
-gzW3ZSlZIp2WWac4jIYRQ Harvard After having been here a couple times I still can t say there s something special about it nor is there something wrong with it It s got something for everyone and especially good seafood offerings for an Irish pub My crabcake sandwich had bits of shell in it though The shepherd s pie is also ok and one of the cheaper entrees that will fill you up The burger offerings are also generous and interesting based on the descriptions I ll try them next time for sure The desserts can be ordered in half portions at reduced price which is incredibly considerate In general it s a great place to go to if you re lacking inspiration It s got a wonderful atmosphere and great drinks selection It s also good for large groups something that not many restaurants in the area can probably accommodate Don t expect a culinary tour de force from Asgard but do expect decent pub American classics 
-g_fyOnklCXYrQBFk-Fncw Harvard Our going away celebration for labmates VS My dinner of an apple crisp AND a Brownie Sunday My dessert of grilled meatloaf My postdessert dessert of bread pudding Several pitchers of stouts ales and porters Who wins The bread pudding by a sweet caramelly landslide My dinner of dessert items apple crisp wasn t very spicy or apply brownies were rock hard and dense made eating a chore Meatloaf grilled Isn t that just a flat square hamburger I don t want grill marks on my meatloaf Unfortunately I also expect soft crumbly texture for meatloaf not the chewy consistency here Bread pudding only outstanding thing pillowy soft topped with a wonderful caramel sauce nice to have on a chilly night get this instead of any other dessert on their menu Appetizers pretty typical fare nothing outstanding buffalo wings needed to be kicked up a notch in spiciness Overall if you need to entertain a large group of friends or coworkers in Harvard Square here s a decent place to go for some pitchers of beer 
-G_n1suUXCraQAojgWxhmQ Harvard What can I say I LOVE this place Very cheap and very delicious and I feel like home The Sunday brunch is the best value and best quality they even have real huge things of maple syrup in each table and organic ketchup try the toffu scarmble trust me Great original pizzas and entrees and now they even serve wine and beer really cheap and great The staff is the friendliest also I will keep coming to this place for as long as I m around D 
-h8Gwym_KRsjwQsXuj-TKA Harvard I was here for a business lunch the other day and found the staff and service to be very attentive The food was excellent and my overall experience was a positive one I have also been here during the summer for bar service and while the place does get quite crowded it is not a bad place to pre game with their knowledgeable bartenders making great suggestions again as the crowd picks up the personalized attention understandably goes away 
-HClzgw11peSjvp5VOVIDg Harvard Bottom line Great service great food decent prices great atmosphere High quality of food and service One of my top 3 favorite places in Boston and Cambridge also like Silvertone for comfort food and Grill 23 for steak I recommend the sunny room that faces the square for best seating Food soup was great burger was great and sandwiches all really good I prefer lunch here over dinner because of the lower priced lunch menu and beautiful sunny room Upstairs on the Square bucks my hypothesis of only eating out at comfort food places in Boston Frankly I can cook better at home than most fine dining in Boston not true for NYC or San Francisco so the only reason to go out to eat is for comfort food that is inexpensive and has decent service 
-Hdj-agpxP0Usx5gikQzcQ Harvard A lot of the other reviews talk about not enough salt etc I am in the school of thought that fresh beautiful seafood should be done with very little alterations The seafood here was incredibly fresh and delicious My parents ordered the crab cakes and stuffed crab mushrooms and I was impressed Each had a yummy dipping sauce We ordered different fish each and I thought all of them was cooked perfectly The price is very inexpensive Great service 
-HfXVChWIwidrQLrUkR7gA Harvard I was ready to LOVE this place We went for my mom s birthday brunch The plus is that it is handicap accessible so my 91 year old granddad could come The minus BIG minus was that the room we were seated in was infested with flies The flies landed on everything the bread the plates the utensils faces hands hair it was really really gross And we weren t the only ones bothered by this the flies were all over the only ones who didn t seem to notice were the staff The service was appallingly slow We couldn t get a drinks list and then when we finally did it was a different waiter who took the drinks order Eventually our waiter came round to take the food order Then the food finally came out but then our waiter never came over to check on us even though by that stage we were all ready for another drink When we found another waiter to bring us coffee our waiter finally came rushing over and was annoyed that we bothered someone else for coffee By then we were all practically finished with our meals anyway And we are not fast eaters we actually like to sit and savor the food and the company Not only that but he then barely filled the coffee cups In my unofficial opinion on breakfast being chintzy about coffee is a bad sign We passed on dessert because we sort of wanted to get out of there while it was still daylight When we finally got the check the waiter gave us the wrong check Ugh what a mess but we still tipped 20 hopefully the tips are pooled I really can t get past the awful service And the flies Blech Swatting them away was not my idea of a fun brunch The food was really good even if my eggs were somewhat undercooked But they were farm fresh eggs and very very good But I am not likely to go back for brunch Nor am I likely to refer anyone to the brunch Not at those prices with that service And those darn flies 
-HHKXGcbC3OQ0oXfFDkdHA Harvard I remember my grandmother walking us down here for lunch on many occasions The Rice and Beans are so good Being Italian I really have no idea what I m ordering or what it s called but the fried pork thingies and the potatoes with the meet inside were awesome The portions are large and everyone is very nice They seem to go on vacation for weeks at a time but when they are there its awesome 
-hi5Swn_FAutLbQgM0PCjg Harvard I don t think I ve ever had anything I disliked or even did not like at Flour Their sandwiches are great not superhuman gigantic like Dave s but with just as much flavour and creativity Their ingredients taste fresh and the breads are nice and chewy with lots of flavour The tartine specials aren t bad as well as they are smaller and open faced providing a smaller bread to filling ratio I also like how they have a half sandwich option for those of us who prefer to retain mobility after lunch or to save room for dessert And dessert is where Flour excels I ve never had a bad dessert experience here There are of course the famous sticky buns but also other options that I feel deserve just as much renown The apple snacking cake is a great option super moist full of small apple chunks and very nicely spiced The trifle is great as well prefect if you want a big moist gooey dessert that s not TOO sweet There are some items I feel can be improved upon including the chocolate banana pudding tasted a bit grainy and the chocolate could have been stronger the Breton cake kougn amann too sweet could use a bit more moisture and the rosemary olive savoury cake needed more olive oil But overall a great bakery where you are bound to find something yummy 
-hJTC5DL_qgYuSaZZDu8Eg Harvard I just finished a Reuben Went Veggie sandwich from Beantowne Coffee House The atmosphere was nice and the staff quite friendly but the sandwich was by no stretch of the imagination a 7 sandwich The description indicated that there was avocado in the sandwich I m not sure why there was avocado in a Reuben In this case avocado did not mean slices of avocado but a sweet salt and vinegar dressing that may have been thickened and colored with avocados There was no avocado flavor at all Otherwise the sandwich was fairly mundane and probably worth almost 5 The marble rye was tasty as were the cabbage and tomatoes 
-HlOJVcqSw5_tv2QKoAaSw Harvard This review is going to be on the restaurant part of the place While I ve been to a few shows here which were all great I want to focus on the food Overall this place serves very good Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food Grape leaves are the best from a restaurant I ve ever had The only better tasting ones I ve had were from the kitchen of my friend s Turkish grandmother All other dishes I ve had here were always great and based on my friend with the Turkish grandmother authentic tasting Service has always been pleasant and attentive Prices are reasonable Ask for a table by the front so you can people watch on Mass Ave 
-hn6ICSp9XDPOeXtYApcMw Harvard Came here for brunch and while there was a 40 minute wait it was so worth it Their amazing bloody marys helped keep me company as my friends waited to be seated Once seated we were treated to a slightly wacky ambiance and served by hipsters I ordered the incredibly delicious smoked salmon benedict and a side of sweet potato fries to die for This is a real gem 
-hoLcJ-xkrJ6uDf4T07TGw Harvard I can tell I m not a foodie and not a fine dining aficionado something you may want to consider reading my review of a restaurant because when I come across a really great dining experience that is good food good presentation good service all in one package it really stands out against the backdrop of work a day adequacy I m apparently accustomed to Blue Room for dinner this Sunday was far and away the best dining I ve had in a while Tomato salad was delicious and beautifully presented The crispy chicken pav was a respectable chunk of breast meat that was just like it promised crispy on the outside but tender and juicy inside and accompanied with potatoes mushrooms and a delicious sauce And the nectarine upside down cake was the perfect finish As if that wasn t enough and it would have been frankly barring simple assault the staff were the perfect blend of attentive without being overly solicitous helpful with suggestions and clarifications for the dietary constraints in our party and at one point genuinely funny Which one of you had the chicken we both did GET IT Ample space they got steadily busier as our stay wound down but that didn t impact the level of service and not too noisy Though I feel compelled to point out the room is not actually blue so if you re a stickler for those sorts of details well then you ve got bigger problems than where to eat in Kendall Square let s be honest Ah and as was pointed out to me afterwards by a friend Blue Room has been doing locavore since before it was the it thing it seems not a huge consideration for me personally but always nice if it comes along with the great food So the next time you and your comrades find yourself stumbling out into the early evening after a Landmark Theatre experience please consider deconstructing the film over dinner at the Blue Room 
-HOlMHgQMJ73ttdTaQCTbw Harvard I went here for Restaurant Week The food was very tasty another vote for the duck the service was good the atmosphere was good It s not the most unusual venue but everything was very competent A great date spot in the middle of Harvard Square 
-HOs9IfbrTzYenTDTMXbkg Harvard Let me start by saying I love the Miracle of Science Tory Row is in a good spot convenient for my waiting for the Lady to finish her yoga class times and the occasional Harvard Square afternoon beer Honestly the food is only OK but this is just a decent spot to get a drink 
-hr1r6u3cqBQluGKLXjrdw Harvard It took me an hour and a half to get my food delivered to my apartment I used the Foodler website to place my delivery order and the projected delivery time said my food would arrive in 45 minutes which was fine with me When it was 15 minutes past when my food was supposed to arrive I called the restaurant to check on the status of my order and was told it was on the way Another 15 minutes later still no food had appeared so I called the restaurant again and was told that they hadn t received my order The employee was very unhelpful and for some reason was unwilling to call their delivery guy to see where he was at I ended up getting my food 45 minutes later than promised The food itself was good enough but the poor quality of customer service I received was inexcusable 
-HrWZxlHMtu03gd0CjpkpQ Harvard Went for drinks on a late Monday afternoon sat at the bar About 100 beers on tap all served in the perfect glass Server was helpful and cheerful knew her beers and steered me toward a fantastic IPA after letting me try a couple samples My friend loved the gazpacho which was pureed and topped with a drizzle of olive oil and some decorative purple flowers Also ordered the charcuterie plate which had among other things a house made pate that must be the love child of bacon and fois gras Served with crispy buttery toast points Yum Went back another night for an excellent burger and fries at the bar Different waiter equally excellent service Thumbs up 
-HVscW7Z-T3loB0VG1GRRg Harvard There s a vibe here that s sort of Seat yourself we ll be there in a minute and I don t say that in a negative way It s an unfussy and welcome relief from the scenester coffee shops you can easily find in the area They have excellent hummus that alone is worth a visit The best thing about Algiers however is the upstairs deck You might as well be in a treehouse with some tea or a glass of wine you can be outside enjoying a lovely summer evening in Harvard Square but without you know sitting outside on a Harvard sidewalk The only drawback to this is if you are sensitive to hookah smoke as it sometimes wafts up from the downstairs tables They ve got some awesome looking old school espresso and coffee machines near the registers You should also look up immediately upon stepping in the front door and check out the mirrored details on the architecture Bring a book bring a good friend bring a desire to relax and enjoy some deliciousness 
-HWwJ3_qgmbi5C9MvKrS9w Harvard What can I say Had I not been to several other shabu shabu style restaurants and also serve this style of food regular to my own family I may not have realized what a bad jobs Shabu Ya does When my wife and I decided to try Shabu Ya we did not have the time to trek on over to Chinatown Instead we opted to have dinner here We ordered the house broth black angus beef a modified sea food platter only shrimp and fish cakes and the tofu plate Our water delivered our drinks and setup the various containers used to mix up dipping sauce For two dinners one small tray containing four small 1 cubed dishes had smears of condiments which we could flavor our ponzu sauce with It was unfortunate that my wife and I had negotiate over who would have 4 slices of scallions rather than 5 slices of scallions in our dipping sauce The broth came and looked a kin to dish water and had about as much flavor as an unreduced weak asian influenced stock Along with the broth our water eventually delivered two sides of vegetables with noodles At this point in our meal we immediately realized the difference in portions and quality of food Our vegetable platters contained a single piece of a nappa cabbage leaf one inch of corn one mushroom one slice of carrot one broccoli floret a sparse stock of water cress and a piece of tofu Had we combined our two vegetable plates we would have had less on one plate than we have ever experienced at other shabu shabu style restaurants After ten minutes had passed and my wife and I had cooked and eaten the majority of our vegetables our waiter finally surfaced with our protein as he described it Our beef plate was rather average in quantity of product It was very tasty albit sliced at times too thin leaving us to scrape shreds of beef off the serving platter The seafood platter left us wanting more The seafood platter contained four prawns and four slices of two different types of fish cakes A frozen single serving dofu plate at a local asian market contained twice the amount of sea food cakes for significantly less The tofu platter was OK however some additional variety would have been nice Next time I would just cut up my own tofu and stay home The decor of Shabu Ya was not to my liking Their design is very modern with crisp lines and high contrast colors Our small round table left very little room for the food and drinks It felt as if we were sitting in the laps of other dinners being so close to them Due to the open floor plan you really notice how often the staff are running around and acting uncoordinated We interacted with four or five different people on the restaurant floor through the evening For people with more than five in their dinning party consider calling ahead as we saw numerous parties of 6 crammed into a booth designed for 4 people I think the people responsible for the restaurant concept forget that shabu shabu is a comfort food which should be served in an atmosphere that is comfortable both in space on the table and between dinning parties 
-HZknny6zG-5yztXp0ZGUA Harvard Just ok I d go there for lunch only because is close to harvard square 
-i0SmF469pJS_56NfRZW9A Harvard I am sad not to write a better review because this place seems legit I will try it again and let you know if I have a better experience next time However I felt that the burrito I ordered was bland It needed and extra kick I am not talking cheese yes I realize good Mexican food does not have to mean lots of cheese which I did appreciate here but their hot sauce was a major let down I need some spice on my carnitas burrito and Boca Grande let me down 
-i2S5baCasOxm7erFXYV3g Harvard Border Cafe es muy muy muy bien Everything I ve had I ve loved including a gigantic strawberry margarita You get unlimited free chips and salsa while you wait What s not to love Except for the fact that you may overindulge and be too full for your delicious meal I am a victim Even that s ok though becuase I really love leftovers Plus the prices are amazing A large tasty inexpensive meal Man I m getting hungry My one word of advice Harvard Square eateries and bars can get pretty crowded on the weekends and Border is no exception I ve been told an hour and a half wait on a Saturday night and they don t have anywhere for you to sit while you wait While the food is amazing it s definitely more worth your time to try stop in for lunch or on a week night instead 
-i3mGR8VKmarlvNLKhW8Cw Harvard I don t eat much meat so I haven t tried it here The veggie plate was pretty satisfying and comes with pita and tahini sauce if you get a couple pieces of falafel I love that you can also get a side of fruit The falafel is tasty and a bit tangy not super dry Beware of the babaganoush It s gelatinous and smoky The prices are on par for the area and the large veggie plate lasts me two meals 
-ICo1QP9Kohci_T5yAP_zw Harvard Alas I went here for lunch today full of high expectations of tastiness after reading all these wonderful reviews and other recommendations Indeed the Eggs Florentine were really awesome and the melange that composes their homefries mushrooms broccoli whoa is awesome except for the one unexpected ingredient A HAIR My dish was whisked away and a replacement was offered and accepted but now I am wary 
-idqNhTNB_dE96v7thzH2g Harvard I don t get all the hype on this place I ve been here several times for brunch and have left disappointed unsatisfied each time Also way overpriced for what it is Why anyone would go here over The Friendly Toast next door is beyond me I ve long since crossed this place off my list 
-iI0i_-fqj9sia8JCjwjpg Harvard It was what it was I would return knowing what I could expect Service was professional food was predictable The Caesar salad was dressed while the lettuce was wet and overdressed and so the flavors were completely diluted or again it was overdressed and the dressing has no flavor but the deviled eggs passed muster without being thrilling a burger was decent though the fries need work blanch them first please In word middle of the road somewhat upscale beer wine and burger place that does a little extra 
-IooZ_UmGQ8Sqdt0HS0WwQ Harvard I never really feel like I m going into battle when I come here with a lot of people I ve had spontaneous cast parties here and last time I was here with 6 people from work Even though we got a smaller table than desired we were never really considered a burden which sometimes happen when you roll up to a place with more than 4 people I think John Harvard s is always good for groups minus Monday night trivia heh The food is definitely hit or miss Sometimes they try and go over the top with sandwiches by making them HUGE Salads are great but get the dressing on the side to avoid soggy leaves and an overdose of creaminess I m not crazy about the regular beers but sometimes I ll get one of their features And they have growlers for those interested in taking home their favorite beer from this brew house Like I kind of mentioned up top the service is really great Most if not all the waiters I ve had have been pretty entertaining and definitely chill I just wish the food was just as consistent 
-isyh-P9FzMxH6jFvrn1eA Harvard Hi Everybody I wanted to tell you about OM from two perspectives I had a great meal there individually AND then since I had to plan a dinner for conference attendees for work I decided to try OM for our group It was amazing Everyone loved it The food was superb and the servers were just as gracious and charming and attentive and pleasant and sweet as you could possibly imagine I have only had really great friendly experiences here I want to recommend it to anyone who wants a lovely meal in a great setting and I want to recommend it to any of you corporate types who want to hold group dinners or functions here My group has held our event dinners all over harvard square and this was by far the most popular with guest and staff alike Try it you will love it Cheers everybody Amanda 
-iUdunaqmbyPOQolBfLI1w Harvard Well this would have been a solid 3 star review until we saw a mouse In the restaurant We were there on Friday Aug 28 and at about 10pm when we were getting ready to leave we all saw a mouse scurry across the back wall of the main dining room The waitress saw the mouse as well and was not at all disturbed which to us WAS disturbing I know that Boston buildings have mouse problems But I don t think it s unreasonable to expect eating establishments to deal with those issues It s one thing to have a mouse in your apartment it s another to have a mouse in an area where you are making food for many many people As for the food it was pretty solidly a 3 star experience Worrying about leptospirosis has downgraded our rating 
-iV0_f37Qqc0qo6MGVqlKg Harvard I am a fan of Cambridge 1 I used to eat here frequently when I was going to school in Cambridge They have very good thin crust pizza with lots of toppings The pizza itself is not greasy and is actually very healthy I especially like the crsipy crust around the edge of the pie I also like the Iceberg Lettece Wedge this dish may not be for everyone but I like it because it is simple and refreshing The price is relatively inexpensive and the ambience is trendy I ve been to many different pizza joints and Cambridge 1 is one of my favorites 
-Iwr5z3fNa2WqeTvRUK2ow Harvard It s been called to my attention that I did not write in my review that we tried to get anyone s attention but I will mention that we did indeed try to flag someone down We attempted many times to verbally get someone s attention as well as physically hand waving etc So having been ignored we left It has also been mentioned to me that it is a seat yourself place a sign might be nice to place you know somewhere Since there is no sign it would have been helpful for someone anyone to have said Hey it s seat yourself so wherever you can find a place It literally would have taken 5 seconds to do so Since it was incredibly busy and we were a relatively large group it s a small bar the tables aren t huge we would have left but definitely would have come back to try again on another day 
-ixYcmm4bLmqZek8XvakEA Harvard I hadn t been to Casablanca in years but recently purchased a Buy With Me discount deal Went for a date night We arrived earlier than our reservation and our table was ready That was a big plus The wait staff was friendly and attentive and of course you have to love the decor I did find it a little weird though that their was no music playing in the dining area This was at about 6 30 at night on a Saturday night I ordered the Sangria and my date had a beer The Sangria was very good We didn t order appetizers as the bread basket and olive oil was sufficient but other tables had apps that looked very good For our main course we had the Pork Chop with Ricotta Dumplings in a balsamic reduction and the Quail on Turnip Mash The Pork Chop was decent nothing to write home about The Turnip Mash however was out of this world I could just eat that All and all the food was excellent but not mind blowing I really should give Casablanca 4 stars as it is very deserving but in comparison to its neighboring restaurants like the Harvest it does not shadow its competitors But definitely good for a date night to impress 
-IzEXa0lK-OkVLDqROiA7Q Harvard I really think that if you live in or around Boston you have to hit up Miracle of Science at least once I freaking adore the enormous Periodic Table menu they have conveniently located on a chalkboard wall The atmosphere is really casual the service is good the crowd is laid back the drink selection and price is reasonable and the food is solid There s no reason to NOT eat here at least once 
-J8LN7nFShUIv3poNrLP0Q Harvard In Annie s House we are always in a battle between Cinderella s or Chicago Pizza when it comes down to pizza delivery or so we thought One few days ago in a little house in East Cambridge we researched high and low for a pizza place that would deliver a fresh mozzarella tomato pie a plain mushroom pie two gingerale s and something very artery clogging for the hungover patient oh and maybe a greek salad too FatS O S Every place had this or that but never the whole combo we were looking for so how great was it when we came across Beauty s a place we ve both eyed many times They had everything the ordering process over phone was smooth and plus they came in lightning speed The still warm and bubbled crust Margherita Francesca even came with a little container with basil Awwwwww how unpredictable The Americana style mushroom pizza was thin and perfect packaged in an almost stylish as far as pizza boxes go cardboard with their personal stickers everywhere Everything was tasty Yummy cheese good quality garlic bread not some mince garlic and slab of butter italian roll Trust me order delivery from here if you are in Cambridge since Pinnochio s and best slice blah blah places would need a pickup What a beauty except the name of the place Beauty for pizza subs and salads and the font color used for the sign Sorry people but typo snob in me wouldn t let those details pass right on by without mention 
-jbLwAXFDmam7SFDD81IIA Harvard Meatball subs are deeelicious The bread is the best part 
-JJEJ1z9EmeDhL6KGh-kHg Harvard Boston has several solid even great pizza joint but very few decent by the slice options Heat lamps warming slowly congealing stale cardboard spinning limply in their glass box is enough to put you off eating all together Which is why Pinocchio s is great the good pizza good location good price means new pies are coming out constantly and your chance of getting something fresh and hot are excellent One of the few places to eat a decent quick lunch on the cheap in Harvard Sq now if they d just bring back the breakfast places 
-jO62aBGXUs67NH7a0a7BQ Harvard Wow what a let down The menu looked amazing yet almost every dish successfully disappointed Service was good although it wasn t clear how familiar our waiter actually was with the menu When asked the difference between the maple beer and their house beer he said that one had a maple finish and the other didn t very helpful Their house beer with pig in the title tastes like a bad homebrew Definitely stick with familiars like the IPA We asked for his recommendation between two dishes pork chop and lamb and he said that he didn t really like either again between another set of choices he couldn t enthusiastically endorse one over the other I m all for honesty but this was a bit much The appetizer a salmon salami was great Really delicate and nice flavors A highlight of the meal The crab cakes were tasty although we both found pieces of shell all throughout them ick My entree the duck was overcooked think dry thanksgiving turkey I sent it back and explained that I would like it a bit more rare The returning dish was practically still quacking it was so raw Again it went back to the kitchen As they have an open kitchen I was able to see the chef line cooks arguing with our waiter about the done ness of things The third attempt was cooked appropriately and was nice Food came out quickly almost too fast in fact We barely had time to finish up our appetizers before they were whisked away and entrees were before us I appreciate prompt service but this was altogether rushed We asked to see the manager who came over and apologetically let us knew he d been informed of the duck situation We also let him know about the shells in the crabcakes He comped the duck and also brought us out a few nice cheeses for dessert I really appreciated the way that the mgmt dealt with things and attempted to make it all better All in Henrietta s was not what we had hoped for 
-jOmP6MUeirI9O_eM7bkDg Harvard I was lucky enough to get to go to the soft opening I d heard they were having I was prepared to cut them some slack since I figured they d need to get their routine down but no slack needed cutting They were totally on the ball The service was perfect and extremely friendly and the food was outstanding The place has a cool diner vibe but more airy and open You ve got a lot to choose from on the menu and I m pretty sure they serve breakfast all day Thank you They have a build your own burger with a ton of different topping options The hard thing is deciding What I really appreciate is the fact that they make most of their ingredients in house things such as their seitan their applesauce and their vegan mayonnaise It s not store bought stuff The desserts were even more incredible We got peach pie which I don t even want to think about because it just makes me want some right now It was made with fresh peaches and the crust was so light and flaky yet crispy ok must stop thinking about it until I can go there again And the vegan blueberry cheesecake unbelievable Why didn t I get any to take home why why why I will learn from this mistake Anyhow I can t wait to go back and try everything on their menu most of which can be made vegan we were told So psyched about this place 
-Jt8F2A0XyQmGuPjuFpIDw Harvard I have a co worker who describes Characters as a the bastard child of a mall food court and an airport bar I personally find this description both adept and hilarious and as you walk into Characters oddly open Chilis in a hotel vibe you might too It s a dive without meaning to be and without being dirty The drinks are fine and the food is fine I had a quesadilla which was completely unoffensive for instance Their weekly Stump Trivia is actually pretty fun because amidst your desolate surroundings you can kick some butt and still brag that you did it a stone s throw away from the intellectual assets of MIT Don t go for dinner don t go on a date and don t go as a destination but dare I say it DO go for plenty of space with good humored friends who want to make their hour a bit happier or your trivia team that s been down on its luck Because mall bar airport food court adds enough character to at least make things interesting 
-jtBlcFKRtdHthURXB7P5w Harvard I can t believe it took me years after living in the area to start eating here I guess I thought it was just dessert and coffee However I d say this is THE place for sandwiches in Harvard Square I ve had their tea coffee hot chocolate quiche baked goods and their famous sweet potato sandwich Oh my God that sandwich As a regular carnivore it s pretty hard to get me to order a sandwich without meat on it But this sandwich is unbelievable Hard to get a seat sometimes because of all the people chilling and studying so I don t recommend coming with more than 2 3 people But I love the atmosphere Honestly love everything about this place I m going to make an effort to visit more often 
-Jtz241EOfDWCvdxR9HLjA Harvard good burger fun place but never seen a busier place same with their other two locations tried to come at 7 and couldnt get a table had to come back after 10 Tried to bring my fiancee here twice and cant get a table always an hour wait 
-jvlMV_f7eNdu8cWOjCRTw Harvard Awesome coffees They taste like hot silk I d love to stay around here all day and indulge in their drinks and pastries but the lack of wi fi is disappointing 
-K-ek3HF1sq7Dy6upeK_bA Harvard I love a good diner menu and quirky places so The Friendly Toast is right up my alley I went on a weekday lunch and the restaurant was packed with people from the local business parks Cambridge Center MIT Labs etc I was on my own so I took a seat at the bar Menu is classic diner with a twist like pancakes and french toast all day but with M Ms in the pancakes if you so choose I had an odd sounding combo balsamic scramble with cayenne pecans and spinach and although I would have never put those things together on my own they were in fact fantastic The homefries accompanying them were passable which is about all you can say of most homefries I have tried in Boston at least these weren t mealy like ones I have had elsewehere Plenty of vegetarian options on the menu was a plus though the sheer number of things with American cheese on them disappointed me Some people may think the decor is either overwhleming obnoxious or just trying to hard in a vaguely punk retro hipster way but I liked the bar covered in decals and edged with mah jong tiles And I am almost certain I heard The Dead Milkmen playing over the stereo so that alone makes me happy I will definitely be back both for the food and for the atmosphere 
-k19zneZa9I4z6vVZNv7gA Harvard Love it One of the best restaurant in Harvard Square High quality food good ambiance though with premium price 
-k7U-wIR3ppx58Eedq2leQ Harvard This is an institution ripe for replacement It s been around so long the sense of entitlement is bred into it The burgers aren t anything to write home about the tables are cramped the serving staff are variable I rocked up there at 5 minutes to 9pm it always shuts at 9 always and the they refused to do a take out shake for me Seriously Shutting early One thing saves it from a lower score the shakes are pretty damn phenomenal But even still it d take a lot to bring me to go back here give the attitude that pervades the place 
-kadAc78rf75SRKRUJeg8Q Harvard Lunch buffet Too expensive 7 95 Too freakin spicy and I like spice I could not taste a thing 
-KcbWzzvKOdyT-5_f_MdLw Harvard Decent pies by far not the greatest but for 9 we got a 6 slice with cheese and it came out real quick Then again we were kinda drunk and hadn t eaten in 8 hours so it s not like we were picky plus it was pouring rain outside and needed a place to chill for a bit 
-KcsRc4UR5aT8CkfkgIo4A Harvard The last review was from early December and maybe this place has improved the kimchi broth was excellent very homemade ish I make kimchi soup often and the tom kha was ok too much lemongrass The quality of all the vegetables especially the mushrooms was excellent as was the beef and pork My friend had the yaki soba which she devoured I ate everything except for the greens which I didn t like The service was fine although our waiter needed to raise the volume a bit On a cold day like today I was perfectly happy to boil my mouth and fingers with some hot cabbage broth Now I want to go to Shabu Ya 
-kHpvFIUIV_45m4d0Sw75g Harvard I stopped in for some dessert tonight with a friend and we had a lovely time Our desserts were delicious but what really sealed the deal was the wonderful service we got from our server Carolyn She was so friendly attentive knowledgable and an absolute delight I would definitely return to this location we left with our hearts as warm as the molten chocolate inside my friend s cake 
-KJPx5Ylen7vD417hXiJRg Harvard I walked past this place nearly every day for two years and somehow never managed to notice it What the So we re wandering around the Square after seeing Salt at the AMC and get a sudden urge for sushi I think crap Shabu Ya is my only option no offense Shabu Ya but you do shabu better than sushi then decide to quickly Yelp it Lo An actual sushi place Sold The sushi itself maki actually can t remember the names but we got three different ones was nothing to write home about but it was super fresh at least and I enjoyed my green tea I think I should ve chosen my rolls better which I will do next time I m in Harvard Square and in need of some sushi Also is this place really BYO They 
-kMl9mda-o0bOpRM66N0GA Harvard Good place for cheap fast ethnic food They serve meat and veggies and decent falafel Not much place to sit more of a take away fast food joint reminiscent of Maos in Barcelona They re open til 3 am on the weekends so perfect for post boozing munchies There s a minimum for credit cards 
-KOMTvCGGJQ1DGRd-S3cpg Harvard This place is small and best suited for take out only but oohhhh the food is so worth it I had a lamb roll up and it was to DIE FOR The prices are reasonable too They only take cash but don t worry there are about 10 ATMs around the corner to choose from Definitely recommended for a late night snack after a night of drinking 
-KOzZqge0avDKTOjJllaeQ Harvard Shortly after I joined Groupon one popped up for Think Tank so I went for it I finally got around to going there with my girlfriend last week on date night and it was fairly disappointing First off we went in at 7pm on Friday night and it was maybe half full This was not the most auspicious sign for a place in Kendall Sq but not a dealbreaker The decor was somewhat spare although they did have a working photobooth at least it was working until two young girls took too much advantage of it The music was 70 s 80 s lounge which was a plus although it was also much too loud We each ordered beers which were reasonably priced at 5 50 on draft For an appetizer we got the crispy pork belly It was tasty and a little bit crispy but I think I was expecting a little more wow from it the gf loved it though For main course I ordered the Seoul burger and gf ordered the Ramen The Seoul burger seems to be their signature dish but it didn t blow me away I ordered it medium but there wasn t even a hint of pink inside The egg is a great touch the bun is tasty and the horseradish aioli was nice The meat wasn t anything to write home about and all in all I d say it was a decent burger but maybe not a 10 burger Plus the sweet potato fries were quite limp The ramen was alright but again not that impressive If you re going to put what is typically college survival food on the menu you should give it some pizzazz and the roasted root vegetables tried to but didn t succeed For dessert we were excited about the State Fair dessert cotton candy caramel apple and funnel cake but the cotton candy machine was broken Disheartened and overall disappointed in an over priced but average ly tasting meal we gave up Service was good our waitress was highly attentive perhaps overly so at times I thought she was going to plop down and join us but I think part of this was due to the lack of busy ness in the restaurant Overall if I lived down the street from Think Tank I might go occasionally for a drink but the food isn t good enough to merit the prices and the trek there 
-kpwgWc9W70r3aX-Jnd-Rw Harvard Based on the mostly good reviews on here I decided to try this new spot for lunch today Before I could even finish my lunch I was compelled to post about what is possibly the WORST chicken parm sub I have ever had Actually up the street at ABC Pizza they make theirs with processed nugget style chicken so they might win that one Seriously these chicken cutlets are so dry and tough I can only imagine that they ve been sitting out for a very long time days maybe and then reheated In fact I almost want to laugh at them for actually trying to pass these leathery chicken artifacts off as food Mediocre bread sauce and cheese round out this disappointing trashworthy lunch And by trashworthy I mean I literally threw 60 of it in the trash 
-KqhcmoKIheAMeDXeNG-lA Harvard Holy Sweet Jesus I worship at the cheesey foot of the Nokes My coworker Matty B and I used to order a full size Nokes pizza every Sunday afternoon and we would waste no time in inhaling the entirety of it s seductive cheesey and meaty goodness Nokes pizza is thick extravagant and not incredibly greasy It will make you weep out of sheer joy 
-kr660OxPpF4MvVUnesdsQ Harvard This brand new counter service eatery is definitely worth stopping by Delicious food made with attention will cost you a bit less than it should The people at the restaurant were really nice and appreciative of our business However you should probably make sure you ve got a few minutes to kill it took them about 15 minutes to prep our lunch with no other customers inside They feature a bunch of lavash ish wraps in typical middle eastern style falafel shwarma hummus etc with lettuce tomato pickle and tahini The wraps are dirt cheap under 5 right now for a vegetarian option and 5 7 for meat The wraps are also delicious and they will even serve them to you out of the wrap and plated if you ask nicely There are some other plated options mostly configurations of the above items which we ll have to go back to try These are a bit more expensive but are still less than 10 The reason the wraps were so tasty was because the food was clearly cooked to order a mixed bag at a place with counter service You expect the food to come out quick so when you re sitting waiting and listening to the falafel fry in the kitchen it can be a little discouraging However it was totally worth the wait I think this also might be due to the fact that this place is new I bet they ll iron out some kinks and maybe raise the prices once things start moving along It s a nicely decorated restaurant with pop middle eastern music playing at a reasonable volume The dude behind the counter went above and beyond in terms of taking care of us although we ordered at the counter we basically got table service to the point where we decided to leave a tip If everybody has as nice a time as we did Viva will do just fine 
-KRjMAqpvjgVuJ9syyMqhQ Harvard After seeing all the reviews and raves from friends this place was just a setup for bitter disappointment however I love it when my cynicism proves to be wrong Atmosphere Sat evening got there 30 mins early to get drinks as expected no hope of getting seated earlier Bar is TINY the restaurant is tucked away behind minimalist decor but cozy Part of cozy though are tight spaces just to warn you We were seated only 5 mins after our reservation Sound level perfect for conversation This place is great for date or small groups Friend had requested a specific table setup before we had arrived and it was nicely accommodated Service Spot on friendly and helpful bartender and waiters Drinks I drove so mocktails for me only 65 a good ginger beer not much taste of the grenadine or cucumber though 44 Minty lemony goodness loved it No complaints from friend about beer and bourbon selections Food Yes the two of us ate all of this we know how to throw it down Plus the portion sizes are just right that somehow I didn t feel ill afterwards Bread Average Corn Bread w Sorghum Butter Crispy w a slightly syrup soaked texture in a good way very dessert like and small so it was befitting as an appetizer sorghum butter has a great finish Deviled Eggs Had the approval of native Virginian friend who is a prolific deviled egg eater Uh how can anything topped with crisp bacon be bad Nuff said Seafood Charcuterie Excellent scallops good amt of acid shrimp a tad overcooked white fish salad on crostini was decent tasted like food reminiscent from a Jewish meal Pork late This is the reason why I could never do Kosher Very sweet but yummy rib and a bomb ass pork belly most of the bomb ass ness attributed to the crisp skin the fatty part could have been better if slightly firmer but whatever I could have eaten a plate of that stuff regardless Shrimp and Grits Creamy but slightly overcooked I would say not as good as purported but tasty Cornmeal Catfish Perfectly crisp outside w o being greasy moist on inside Dirty rice yummy and light Roasted Pear Bourbon Ice Cream Cake Uh ice cream cake yes please Not a huge fan of the pears but they were not overwhelming and overall still a winner Peach Tart w Tarragon Ice Cream Warm gooey inside crisp top Wished the peach were sweeter but friend liked it just the way it was Tarragon ice cream was surprisingly pleasant and refreshing would definitely buy a tub if they made it At end of meal they gave us little tiny bites of chocolate w peanuts and oats a pleasing last bite Overall Food 4 stars but bump up to 5 for really lovely staff service and overall dining experience Will def be back for their 10PM menu that they have on Fri and Sat nights 
-ktIWStweLJ-W7QmYln3kg Harvard Oooh Korean Wings Sounds tasty In fact they are pretty good But there are some pretty big problems from being top drawer First I love me some spicy wings but there s gotta be something to calm yourself down No ranch or anything yes I realize this is a Korean restaurant However I m sure there must be some Korean equivalent I guess there was some cole slaw or what I think is actually kimchi but it didn t do that great of a job And of course the pickles LOL I m chuckling as I write this Its almost preposterous as to how this restaurant could serve this piece of shit Literally though it smelled like crap No I m not insane because as we took the leftovers home a lady on the bus noted how it smelled like death There isn t even a fictional smell from a Harry Potter potion that could rival how crappy this thing smelled I m glad no one realized the smell was coming from our Bon Chon bag otherwise we might have gotten kicked off the bus Stay away from the pickles otherwise the other things are pretty good 
-kygInYXIjYmFFiH4UaJrw Harvard This place is jumpin but the coffee isn t amazing and it s hard to find a seat sometimes The dessert food pastries and whatnot are really tasty though 
-L2NF7I2kd3oBLi3DhJIDA Harvard Lord or Hobo Last night I went with friends to Lord Hobo aka the resting place of B Side Lounge and we were all very confused for what they are trying to go for On the one hand the lights are bright gone are the cozy booths of B side to be replaced with uncomfortable high top tables and backless stools and a bunch of flat screen tv s playing sports Ok so looking around you think this is a dive sports bar Then the menu comes with admittedly creative but expensive entr es starting at 20 What the what If I want to spend 20 an entr e I want an atmosphere to match like Oleana or Dante but with dive sports bar atmosphere I need a huge plate of nachos for 6 and 3 drafts What Lord Hobo has is a major identity crisis Maybe that s what the weird name is all about Lord prices with a hobo atmosphere Not sure who they are trying to appeal to The crowd seemed to be inherited b side hipsters not the frat boys who might be into watching sports on the flat screen tv s Well good luck lord hobo and working out your identity issues I won t be back The whole experience just made miss B side more tear Peace out girl scouts 
-lDxXHNUNrwWUFnvnL_WSQ Harvard I read the reviews out of curiosity and then remembered it has been waaay too long since my last visit to Cuchi Cuchi Walk in and be instantly charmed by the art deco glam craziness oh and the excellent food and drinks The tuna tartar avocado mousse cornets are mind blowing It is a bit expensive but the more people in your group the better to sample all the dishes I came here one night with about 10 people and I think we got one of everything off the menu and it was all great The brie en croute is the stuff dreams are made of 
-LmfVI9lc0Vm3vCVfnNpDw Harvard last week i hit up the middle east to watch a friend play a show good venue decent bar and ample room can t complain i ve seen numerous shows and have always had a good time there my gf also does belly dance shows there so i gotta show them some love 
-lN9xJo7fBJO1Bp9pOzdUw Harvard My FAVE I will always find an excuse to go to this place Delicious and affordable And unlimited chips and salsa while you look through the menu The shrimp and crawfish quesadilla is highly recommended It s just under 9 but i ALWAYS have leftovers The only bad thing about this place is that it can get super crowded but usually only on friday and saturday nights 
-LopP23CSYbJ_JogN94Qzg Harvard Totally don t understand the hate for this place Four friends and I headed here for Restaurant Week and it was fan freaking tastic All five of us got the all fondue version of the three course meal and I was really impressed The Swiss cheese fondue appetizer was perfectly executed gooey cheese not too salty with an interesting assortment of things to dip in the cheese The highlight for me was their potato wedges really crispy and perfectly balanced against the cheese The main course was probably the weakest of the three but seriously it s chunks of meat that you cook in delicious broth and then dip into things still a pretty high baseline of awesomeness The beef and shrimp were both very high quality meat and the broth we got the French broth which has mushrooms and beef stock and some other spicing that the vegetable broth doesn t was excellent My only complaint was with the sauces which were a little boring Dessert was knee weakening Conversation which had been lively and animated until that point stopped dead in its tracks when that chocolate concoction appeared I ve never seen a group of people tear through a spread of food as quickly as we did The chocolate was perfect and the assortment of things to put in the chocolate including chocolate brownies which created a level of chocolate y ness that I m sure is illegal in most states was great With a nice bottle of the house white which our server recommended and which was really quite good and not at all expensive though if you want to spend some money on a bottle of red boy have you come to the right place this was an outstanding dinner Service was a little slow but that s probably because the place was packed to the gills and it actually worked out well because I ate an entire meal s worth of cheese as an appetizer and needed the extra time to make room for dessert I d definitely come back for another Restaurant Week and I m curious enough about the standard menu that I might come back later this fall 
-lQBgXG6qrd7Bt6pL2OUKg Harvard I ll review the Pheonix for it s lunchtime cuisine I hit this place up during the week on my lunch break The waitresses almost always change and there is almost always the guy having bud for lunch sitting at the bar The burgers buff chicken sand steak and cheese and nachos are all pretty good They also serve smithwicks which you can t find many places get it with a guinness head just sounds cool The place has totally different dive feel during the day compared to the night Why wait in line at the Miracle when you can go to the Pheonix 
-lS6WGMH6UCefN3yzHlrQg Harvard The warm beet salad with goat cheese was delicious and much larger than expected The steak was a little salty as were the frites but sometimes salty is delicious While the cocktails may be on the expensive side our vodka sodas were large and strong Service Not bad but not particularly good either 
-lYsnL0C_K6AZguFQbxv8Q Harvard Wooo this was such a convenient place to eat It s right in Harvard square I went in early Sat morning and classes just started for the undergrads so that may be why it was somewhat empty Can t speak for how it gets later in the year I had an omelette which comes with home fries and toast 8 They had some fancy stuffed french toast for their specials too but I was in a more savory mood Omelettes were not fancy or anything standard not ridiculously stuffed but I enjoyed it Service was chill and they were very nice Place is a strip of booth chairs so come with a small crowd or avoid a crowd altogether If this place was hard to get to I wouldn t necessarily come back but I like that it s relativel cheap and in harvard square with decent food that fulfills my breakfast needs 
-lzMrX4AX0XUo0WF-AM-NA Harvard Ick Just ick I wasn t expecting anything great and I m pretty forgiving as far as cheap food goes not a picky eater at all But this was far far beyond what even I could stomache It was greasy to the point of being oily and tasted like sweet rancid chicken broth Judging from the other reviews I m guessing this place has some okay or even good dishes and some really horrible ones I ordered pad thai I m too blind to read the descriptions on the menu ahead of time and went with the first thing I recognized But even if their other dishes are gourmet quality they only get a single star from me if you can t cook something well don t put it on your menu 
-L_epZY2ChD9xsIfbbd4tQ Harvard Great green gooey lord they have the garlic sauce that I have missed ever since Ararat in Watertown closed down a couple years ago ASK FOR IT It can probably make anything taste better ice cream croque en bouche mandoo navratan korma baklava Hamburger Helper you name it I bet that garlic sauce improves the taste You could spread it on your arm and try to absorb the nutrition through your skin The guy who runs the place is so nice that I don t want to think about the kinda dried out chicken shawarma You know what I don t care They have friggin amazing garlic sauce They could serve shoe leather sandwiches but I d probably not notice the garlic sauce is that good 
-M1HHBL_e5nluhfxrupcvA Harvard Great beer list Had appetizers of vegetarian chili nachos yum calamari too small a portion but YUM and the crab cake salad for dinner Then I saw the mice Same night as the other reviewer apparently running around and across the dining room as the sun went down Mentioned to the waitress and she said Oh where Told her ummmmm right there me pointing and she said she d take care of it Really dude 
-M1rgYnaoGC82VEta1gdsg Harvard average tasting above average healthy pizza for astronomical prices but they let you pre order online which is very cool especially for busy families the margherita pizza is very disappointing and plain despite the fresh basil leaves pepperoni lover s pizza is fine though the amount of toppings is quite sparse It all tastes fine and being able to order whole wheat crust earns the bonus star to 3 because the prices are just too high THEY DON T ACCEPT DISCOVER CARD 
-m3rQwS1ncMouMiV9u-leQ Harvard Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh THAT s what a falafel wrap is supposed to taste like 
-m5n0PZVgrhSAaQUgTBzng Harvard Fancy place The food was very good but only small portions Also very pricy What was interesting during the evening three of us got a Toronto and its taste alcohol content and the amount served vast differed in each case I was lucky and got the most alcohol and also the largest amount this was good Also tried the two other drink and at least one was not good We talked to them about it but it was not properly fixed They did not offer to replace the drink 
-m73irTk1N5IQCcUdFTreQ Harvard The only good thing about this place was the waitress She was sweet and attentive though not mind blowingingly good I can t believe how crappy the rest of the experience was My friends and I had reservations for days and were really looking forward to it But then we are being walked past dirty empty tables and were brought to a booth shoved in the corner of the back exit with no light and a sticky table I kindly asked for a new table and was initially told no but then I asked again and said we d be willing to wait The host went and got another hostess who walked back and said we could but we d have to wait 30 minutes despite that fac that were were only a few people in line and SO many tables just dirty and waiting to be bussed So we got stuck sitting in the darkest corner booth imaginable by an area where they store stuff just terrible And the food was awful Our vegetables weren t cooked because they didn t steam them at all so thanks for the luke warm pasta and hard broccoli really worth the money Just not worth the time seriously 
-mAZVO-oRhYx2KPD5CnTrw Harvard Harvard Square seriously lacks in cheap brunch places and I was ecstatic when I discovered this place Extremely reliable for a very QUICK sit down breakfast Never a line on the weekdays From start to finish breakfast will take you 45 minutes tops so it s a great place to come before class I usually get the hash eggs with coffee and it comes to 11 with tax and tip I ve also ordered the cheese blintzes as well as the California benedict instead of ham there s avocado both of which are delicious They also have a large selection of very inventive omelettes although I m not a big fan of eggs so I ve never tried them Their portions are large and you d have to be very hungry to finish it all They also keep the coffee cup full Awesome The only reason I ve docked them one star is because their food isn t out of this world by any means Just some good filling brunch that doesn t leave me feeling like I m about to have a heart attack Love the ambiance too Colorful large booths and very spacious retro atmosphere Lots of window seating rare in Boston with natural light I also love how you can sit there sipping coffee long after you ve paid the bill without feeling any pressure from the staff to leave I ll definitely keep coming as a regular 
-Mc2_Avfu7Rc-kXNotC4sA Harvard Great burgers and fries Haven t tried the shakes yet The workers could be smarter The last one messed up my order a bit but they are still nice I like this place more than the nearby mr Bartley s It Is cheaper and good qualit Definitely go if you re in the square 
-mL39ncSTNSrwOPxSeICIQ Harvard I love their burritos I never liked burritos until I came here 
-MlkSMtKgl5F_BnsKpo1lg Harvard Chill laid back atmosphere perfect for a lazy afternoon lunch or dinner I came with 5 others just after the Sunday lunch rush A waiter came up to us and said the big table was about to free up but we could grab drinks at the bar while waiting We sat at the right angle high table and ordered off the periodic table menu of burgers and satays The waiters even have nerdy shorthand to take orders The mimosas are served in regular pint glasses and decently priced considering how much you re getting to get pleasantly buzzed during the day My Ronie burger was stuffed with jalapenos and spicy The fries are really pan fried potato wedges so they might be healthier for you than regular french fries Service was ok Our server was nice and helpful I definitely could ve used a water refill early into my jalapeno burger Nice views of Mass Ave where you can people watch and observe men unicycling down the street 
-MMXfT2o9_yoV4QDG0wyAg Harvard yes Yes YES This place is A mazing and lives up to all the hype that has been generated This place serves southern food that is exhaulted beyond comfort food in fact it ranks up there with last meal status The place is adorable small but larger than you originally think and rather cozy The parking is a bit of a pain but thankfully there is cinema parking right around the corner and they validate woot woot The drink list was short and sweet and so interesting that I couldn t make up my mind on what I wanted to try first They went over my head with the hippest retro ist of liquors so I picked something that sounded delicious that happened to have grapefruit in it I forget the number and can t pull up the menu for some reason but it was good enough that I didn t stray from that cocktail the rest of the evening it was strong yet refreshing and very delicious As it was a group of 6 of us we were able to do some serious carnage on the menu The appitizers we mowed down included the salad the cornbread the clams casino the Grits and the pork confit They were all inhaled and claimed delicious by the table But seriously if you must know the cornbread and grits are a carb lover s dream or nightmare depending on said carb lover s diet situation at the time For our meals again we easily devored more than half the menu with the standouts being the trout w califlower and browned butter melt in my mouth tender with a nutty unctious flavor explosion from the browned butter sauce and the Catfish crispy skin delicious flavors Not to say that the steak chicken and dumplings i e gnocchi and the pork and beans weren t delicious they were We were too full to have an actual solid dessert but managed to force down yet another round of cocktails Service was great my every need was met and I left fully of delicious food and booze 
-MnQ-A0kJ5syzTtb5qTFOw Harvard 3 5 Stars Great New England cuisine They pride themselves on local farmed ingredients and the freshness definitely plays out The food here definitely has a lot of flavors The service was also good Definitely come here Sunday to Thursday for the discounted 3 course menu I have two complaints about this place though First the side rooms are not very well decored like the main room Second the portions on the dishes are inconsistent My girlfriend ordered the Mahi Mahi and it was cheaper and has more food than my dish I ordered the sea scallops for 27 and it has three pieces Note This place is louddddd 
-MotPOe7-FFjcSM4BULqhg Harvard Had the chicken sharawama Holy isht Batman it was amazing AND different flavored fruit Snapples No wai Seriously I m a n00b at Mediterranean food I literally went in there and was like so what do people get OK I ll get that OK yeah sure Uh huh Price is great amount is great large enough glass windows so I can creep on people walking down the sidewalks and not feel like a hamster Yeah so there was a mmm turnip in the wrap Might I warn you that it is AWESOME I m so bleh towards weird sounding vegetables SPINACH Whaaaa but wow Good food So If you ever decide to hit up the List Visual Center this is a perfect place for lunch Seriously You like jammin food down your throat this is a good joint 
-mSkS1icyHpGKpBMafaTTg Harvard Came here and splurged a bit on the Chef s Whim 6 course tasting From an amazing amuse bouche of squid noodles to a couple more than satisfying desserts everything was top notch First few were seafood the squid noodles crab scallop then faro pasta hanger steak ice cream and flan a couple macaroons to round out the night Trust the chef he knows what he s doing And he s very generous with the portions we left completely stuffed Waitress was very nice though we did have countless servers throughout the night Tucked away on a side street just behind Toscanini s this place is really a gem Makes me a happy girl 
-mTYHZiNDar95qHnDCnVYw Harvard One of the best cheap lunch spots near MIT a perennial favorite of mine Often crowded but still relatively quick even when there s a big line Once they overcharged me by two dollars and I didn t discover it until I checked my credit card statement weeks later I went back and explained what happened and the guy just gave me the 2 refund on the spot Mistakes happen and he really did the right thing rather than give me a whole story about how I had to have proof etc Good food good people 
-MVe_3lIdTXqAKoXGz2hxA Harvard Al Pastor Burrito for dinner Yes please Delicious and so much better than Ana s not trying to start a war it s my personal opinion The service and staff are so nice and friendly Eating in or taking to go is a pleasure 
-MvFSyPtNModwtU8bMh7Cw Harvard Firstly 10 cash minimum Come prepared Fantastic coffee Fantastic Their well pulled espresso drinks are some of the best I ve had in Cambridge I once indulged in some sort of flavored latte frippery which as a black coffee drinker I admit was a mistake but it was disappointing all the same and expensive to boot While drinks are surprisingly well priced beware a small is an 8 oz espresso size cup I don t mind terribly as I am generally of the opinion that portions are bigger than they need to be but it was surprising the first time around One thing I ve never been disappointed by the food The salads are always fresh have more upscale options berry feta is delicious and are a filling size The pastries are routinely fan freaking tastic and not to be missed Plus the place is beautiful Crema s exposed brick decor with its second floor loft seating is beautiful and welcoming Friends and guests I bring along always coo at its cuteness upon passing the threshold Given its quality and charming decor I have grudgingly accepted that I only ever stand a one in four chance of finding a seat This is fine in the summer but awkward during the winter if I wanted to sit and talk with my companion Truly sad however was my discovery that there is no WiFi in Crema But I guess then seats would be even harder to find so I ll take the trade off 
-mZCHg8WzN1CHEX6Xq8A0A Harvard Before a few rounds of pool at FTJs a friend and I wanted to grab a quick dinner On our way over to the nearby brewery we noticed this new place and decided to check out the menu I think we were so blown away by the decor not really in a good way that we didn t notice what exactly was on the menu But in the interest of supporting new small businesses we decided to try it out My friend got a funky salad but I went boring w a burger Our beer battered onion rings were awesome esp with the caper flavored dipping sauce I was excited to learn they were serving white sangria and my friend went with the waiter s suggested raspberry beer Unfortunately that was the end of the positives Half way through her salad my friend realized that the walnuts were cruelly dusted with something really really spicy Neither she nor I could finish it Which was too bad since my burger came out under cooked twice I gave up and they took it off the bill By that time I realized there wasn t really any alcohol in the sangria that I could notice and being a lightweight I would have definitely noticed consuming a glass of wine esp after eating only some onion slices and a few bites of salad I give the waiter credit he did try to make us happy I don t feel we experienced some of the Twilight Zone service some of the other Yelpers have mentioned luckily But I seriously doubt I will be making any effort to return there again soon Last minor gripe for someone with less than perfect vision the menu type is really hard to read 
-n70KjLgEwovqh3yr0nzGQ Harvard I tried this place on a Friday night It was suggested by a friend for drinks I d never been and some of the reviews here were good so we tried it out The location was really convenient I happened to drive in but lucked out with a free spot on a side street It s at basement level so its low key and private from the street above We sat outside on the patio area The service was quick and very friendly Good wine and drink selection The server suggested some new summer beers which we tried For appetizers the chicken quesadillas were really packed full of meat and vegetables and were great Around 10 they started moving the tables and to make the dance floor and the music started going and they were charging a cover The crowd was a diverse mix of people mostly in their 20 s I will check this place out again I hear Thursday s are really hopping 
-nadSqTtnbzMgRonS2i-bA Harvard Back East on family business from Portland OR Decided to revisit my favorite lunch place from the 80 s when I lived in Cambridge and worked at MIT Back then Mary s was located across the street and was BYOB Wow The memories flooded back as I enjoyed my old favorites Suan La Chow Show and Dun Dun Noodles I ve found Suan La Chow Show at Chinese restaurants in Arlington and Peabody but they are in a sweet sauce not the delightful spicy one served at Mary s Cash only but moderately priced Topped things off on the way out with a chat with Mary about the old days Chinese restaurant heaven 
-nfzivPz8zPD6JA1ocuSnw Harvard Their only claim to fame might be the first indian restaurant in cambridge but they do a good job holdin that title As one of the spicier restaurants I ve ever been to my boyfriend and I LOVE spicy food you can expect good portion sizes not too big but you ll get real full if you do appetizers too and the same waitress who is lovely It is a rather small restaurant that has a comfortable vibe and a huuuuuuuge menu to choose from I adore it but make sure you order enough nan garlic is my fave to cure the spice 
-NHmEzNPa7ykKaE_8EYKjg Harvard A group of five of us went to Rialto for my Birthday Dinner Those of us that arrived early had a drink at the bar while waiting the bartender was very friendly and suggested some very good wines from what we told him we liked He didn t harrass us but made sure we always had what we needed When we got to our table we saw it had been decorated with ribbons and sparkles what a cute touch for my birthday Our waiter Cesar I think it was was beyond fantastic The first thing out of his mouth was we re out of the salmon tonight but it s not very good anyway so you re not missing out There are some way better things He was very laid back and friendly helped us choose dishes and a bottle of wine with ease while recognizing that we weren t high rollers about to spring for the 200 bottles We each got something different and of course shared as 5 girls are wont to do Nobody had a bad meal that s for sure I started out with the parma prosciutto which came with quite a bit of food for the price I was pleasantly surprised Everything was very fresh and flavorful I got the scallops for my big meal and they were absolutely perfect Everyone else s meals were amazing too not one complaint Dessert was so amazing Once again Cesar did a great job explaining everything and giving recommendations We were all stuffed to the gills but just had to try something Mine was brought out with a candle and happy birthday written on it not over the top but really sweet While we ate the head chef came over I recognized her from the website to ask how everything was and wish me a happy birthday She was very personable and sweet very nice The GM also came over more than once to check on us and strike up conversations He and our waiter brought us over some complimentary desserts which we did not need but absolutely devoured and even a few glasses of some amazing dessert wine that we probably wouldn t have otherwise thought about ordering Everyone from the hostesses to the top brass was so friendly and sweet to us what a wonderful way to spend my birthday 
-NLGpWs3FRfQU5--mCF_uA Harvard I dig Cinderella s pizza a lot I find it s consistent fresh tasting and good I always forget this place though Apparently they re open late and I know they deliver I just don t have a menu I ve had to look it up online in obscure texts on MIT student webspace before what s that about UPDATE They mailed me a menu you can totally get them to deliver Toscanini s Ice Cream 
-NmbLCAqRiGkzmjhw3_TwQ Harvard Gorgeous Upstairs on the square is an experience for the eyes and nose taste is controlled by your ability to smell After my third visit to Upstairs I still find this place exciting and now even more rewarding since meeting Matthew the Director of Ops He has an incredible ability to remember a face and insures fantastic service While the food tends toward the expensive side Upstairs offers local grown vegetables and meats and local seafoods in ways you wouldn t think to enjoy in your own home It is a lovely locale to treat a friend your mother anyone special though I maintain that some men can t take the decor too many times in a year 
-nnS8RW5JQ5upcjmDgK9iA Harvard Unfortunately it s yet another generically named Indian place it d be nice to see some different names from time to time Like most Indian places the price range and general quality of meals is probably quite different for lunch and dinner I went here for dinner so no buffet I was pleased to find a Royal Dinner for Two which made the whole night very easy and not any more pricy than it would ve ended up being anyway They had the appetizers and we picked two entrees and two desserts The selection was much wider and more varied than average My taste for Indian is not quite as well tuned as I would like but I d say the dishes themselves ranged from about average the samosa the paneer to above average lamb dish we had the drinks the desserts for a slight fancy Indian place I ve had better elsewhere but the overall experience here was better and easier to manage The waitstaff was responsive and willing to answer my various questions about the food presented to me and quite willing to package it all up for us when we inevitably failed to finish all the food we got I ll definitely go back again 
-nntiIu8QkP9L_VxmHmMlQ Harvard Greater Boston being alongside with San Francisco the most European of metropolitan areas in the United States should have more eatery places like Moody s Falafel Palace This Central Sq obligated late night stop for God s hungry children offers healthy and tasty food from the Middle East at a very affordable price While in Europe it was easy to find these independent food stands which run at a small scale and don t hurt your wallet So far I ve been two times and I m already a fan Try the baba ganouj however it s spelled sandwich This is not a place for an elaborate date but I m sure a lady would appreciate if you showed her this convenient place for the first time 
-npSN90aZyVlh_0c52N3FQ Harvard Beautiful place terrible service We came for a birthday celebration party of 6 very excited to come in there for the first time What a huge disappointment The waiters screwed up on every meal course we had The appetizers the main course not a single dish was delivered to the correct person at the table When they brought the desert there was one with the Happy Birthday signed in chocolate on the plate Nice if it was actually put in front of the person who had the birthday The food was OK and only OK There was nothing interesting out of 6 different dishes And that would be fine but the service was so bad that maybe the food tasted it too The charge for service was automatic on the bill 100 Too bad the team of waiters did not deserve it 
-NrMvA2Cv9JWjp9p2R_UwQ Harvard Izzy s is one of those neighborhood institutions I wish we have at home in the DC suburbs We were treated like a neighbor the service was very friendly Food was very good of the home cooked variety I had the ox tail stew with a cup of the beef tripe soup Everything was great Lots of the neighborhood residents stopped by while we were eating to get carryout and chatted with the boss and his wife and son Would love to return again next time I m back in Boston 
-nSRcmtAkI-0D4_RxV2URg Harvard This is one of those places that I shouldn t review because I love it so much and I don t want people taking up all of the outdoor seating but here I go I love Cafe Pamplona because it offers me the opportunity to feel as if I am in Europe for the afternoon on a sunny day It manages to house itself in a small nook of Harvard where the street is less busy and the buildings surrounding it evoke a different time and or place I also love Cafe Pamplona because of the menu options This is also one of those places where I always give the specials a look over before ordering because today may be the day they are offering one of my favorites The waitstaff may at times seem to be a bit slow this is not the type of place to go to when you re in a hurry but in turn when you want to take your time at lunch the waitstaff does not breathe down your back to get moving even though you ve obviously finished your meal However the person waiting for a table may

-O0mZsAZn0dJmv6eVqzJeg Harvard I d been wanting to go to this place for a while after seeing it s successful ratings and popularity on multiple sites including this one and hearing about it constantly from one of my friends So one night after heading home from a Bruins game my buddy and I not wanting to part ways quite yet we decided to head over there for a drink and some grub Unfortunatly for us by the time we got there they stopped serving food that sucked but it did our wallet a favor considering that their food is way overpriced I looked at the menu and was shocked at home expensive it was I go out a lot and it s the first time I ve seen a pulled pork sandwich hit 11 Honestly But there is one thing that in my opinion enabled them to escape with minimum review damage and a whooping four stars and that is their drinks menu They have some classic cocktails that you can t really find anywhere and that s I m very fond of Pimms Singapore Slinger Caiparinha Even the mojito FINALLY A PLACE THAT POURS THESE WHOOOHOO And for that alone I m a fan Needless to say that I had alcoholic drinks as my main food group and dinner that night Well worth it The decor itself is pretty cool and trendy and finding parking in the evening or night isn t usually too hard The bartenders are knowledgeable and actually talented compared to most I ve seen in Beantown they know what they are doing And it reflects Definitely a chill place I will be back

-O6KOkyjH8-MbgzItRx0yA Harvard I was in town visiting and I needed a place to watch the United stoke match While I may not have been the happiest with the result from the match phoenix landing certain more than did it s job The draft selection was solid Your normal irish and euro taps along with other major boston new england brews on tap as well There was a good crowd for the match While it wasn t packed to the gills there were plenty of seats taken and it was a crowd that certainly wanted to watch the match It was a pretty good atmosphere and it did make for fun while watching the match I don t know how this is during different circumstances but this is a good place to watch a match 
-OdJEOXP3aURQ4GoQIZPQg Harvard Pick something and do it really really well That is UBurger Met a friend for burgers and fries the other night I went with the cowboy burger a ground sirloin burger with bbq sauce pepperjack cheese grilled mushrooms and bacon I also got a side of fries and a chocolate shake My friend had a double veggie cheeseburger with fries and a soda We realized after we were sitting and eating that the veggie burgers were from a box and not made in the restaurant I loved the juiciness of my burger and the fries were hot and crisp The shake was also super tasty thick and chocolatety just how I like it Can t go wrong at UBurger 
-ODW8QgSC_n9msiNcW9zKA Harvard Came here on a Saturday night with the fiance and some of his work study students for a end of the year party This place was super busy OMG I couldn t even move It was absolutely nuts I wasn t too keen on the whole overcrowded being shoved every two seconds part But the margaritas were awesome They were mixed just right strong but with just the right amount of raspberry sweetness We were seated finally and the waitress was very accommodating She dealt with the unruliness quite well I had the chicken fajitas and the fiance had the burger They were nothing to write home about but definitely hit the spot to soak up that alcohol The group had quesadillas pasta dishes tacos etc All the plates were licked clean so I am assuming their meals were good The highlight of the evening was not consuming 7 margaritas and feeling really good it was seeing Ben Affleck and Jennifer Gardner with their daughter having dinner So cool So Border s gets 4 stars A solid score Minus a star for only 2 stalls in the little girls room What is up with that 
-oimt-rtIDRRYftdZGpmUA Harvard Felipe s Taqueria turns out to be one of the best little taqeria s I ve ever been to Whether you are reveling in their huge burritos drizzled with sides of various salsas or attempting the daunting task of eating their huge portioned platos You can t really go wrong with Felipe s For the money you will probably not find any other place quite like Felipe s Anna s Taqueria rivals Felipe s on some dishes Their portions are monstrous service is fast and the location in the Garage in Harvard Square is perfect The only bone I have to pick with them is the fact that they take cash only no credit or debit Not that you d even have to use a debit or credit card with their prices Personally I love the place and I have a hard time when in Harvard Square deciding where to eat because of its close proximity to another one of my favorites Le s formerly Pho Pasteur Well I highly recommend that you check out Felipe s but don t bring your plastic bring a few George Washingtons 
-ojFOuyxCNM1GKkHYpI4Gg Harvard Went Last Friday and We had Last Smash and Moscow Mule Cocktails Domaine Cheveau Macon Chardonnay Cheese Plate Bone Marrow salad Loup de Mer and the Swordfish Total bill 185 before tip Very reasonable All the food was delicious Though my swordfish seemed bland it was a delicate umami flavor I blame myself for ordering a mild flavored dish after eating rich and awesome bone marrow my first time Her entree and salad were both excellent and the cheese was phenomenal Cocktails were out of sight and the wine was very nice The service was average Our server was attentive but in a pushy way and after every sip of water a staff member topped off our glass of water Also the bar high top chairs felt purposefully uncomfortable with short cushions and no place to rest your feet Overall we were treated very well and enjoyed our evening immensely The wine list was priced a little steep but I am comparing it to other lists that are purposefully reasonably priced The food was very very good The service was totally adequate and the atmosphere was fun The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is that I had really high expectations for the best restaurant in Boston and felt that it fell a little flat I am totally going to give it another try though 
-OjiRL7cQt2sHl2EhAYm8Q Harvard Beers with friends 200 Great Conversation Great Company Perfect Summer Night Priceless Had drinks here last night with a bunch of friends including Barney B I ve been here many times and I love the outdoor seating It s such a huge courtyard so it can fit a lot of people comfortably And there s nothing better than a few drinks with friends on a warm summer night outside My only slight complaint no food after 10pm come on Serve till at least midnight if not 1am 
-OK4RBdBJ1G6YB6WKKFtEw Harvard I d love to give them 5 stars for this location but I just cannot do it The now defunct Davis Square location was just that much better Heaping on praise for the new addition to the menu the Yucatan burrito So good with the pickled onions Try it 
-oMv2Si4Ie45sW8YVDWkyw Harvard I dig this place and while I ve only gone for cocktails they re pretty awesome The drinks are reasonably priced around 6 8 and boy howdy there are a lot of them 6 pages of cocktails plus a couple on the specials menu There are a handful of egg based drinks on the menu and the ones I ve experienced have turned out delicious This place is almost always busy so the bartenders are pretty busy Good luck getting a seat If you manage to get a seat while you wait for drinks it s a good idea to get some snacks to enjoy the chips dip is excellent 
-onvKQcuWvX1Ia6kY3JpfA Harvard Complicated menu read overpriced if you want all the toppings and just like most of the reviewers mentioned massive structural issues with the rollup of this burrito Mine not only collapsed under its own sogginess but it was rolled sideways so it was all guac and salsa on one end and all chicken on the other The taste is not bad and the yogurt replacement of sour cream is a good new age California addition however Anna s at MIT still worth the 5 minute extra walk Oh and they don t take AMEX either 
-OPUZUUwqMwcqQgcI1hQkg Harvard Tragically overrated I won t argue with anyone about the sweet potato fries they ARE really good perfect texture in my opinion And I won t claim that I didn t enjoy my Viagra Burger wait what It was well cooked on a nice ever so slightly crunchy bun and a decent size 7 oz Except that it cost 10 and the bleu cheese on it turned out to be cheap bleu cheese dressing Do you realize that for 2 more you could get a burger at ABE LOUIE S one of the most expensive steakhouses in Boston And they ll at least put real bleu cheese crumbles on it Hell they ll put real bleu cheese crumbles on it at FRIENDLY S The space is too small too or rather they ve crammed way too many tables into it Sure service is friendly so friendly in fact that I couldn t carry on a conversation with my friend for more than 2 or 3 minutes without being bothered by MULTIPLE waitresses at once And about this claim that they ve been named America s Best Burger I don t buy that for a second Yeah it s good but the best Come on now 
-oRPxciUwq8YeS-IcxDERA Harvard Went here last night for some post work drinks after trying to go to Grendel s too crowded and before we headed over to The Burren Cozy bar decent beer selection no hard liquor drinks though be warned nice music casual divey atmosphere I liked that they listed Black Tan Snakebite and Black Velvet on the actual menu I tend to forget these exist unless reminded and their hand cut fries were fresh thick and chunky with the skins still on just how I like em Service was decent prices are decent all in all not a bad place to grab some drinks Not a total destination but not a total last resort either IMO 
-Ot017iM54hObZY5xZGk6g Harvard I went here for restaurant week I was very impressed by the food The decor is also super cute Yum 
-ot3a-SxinexzVptFmIl3w Harvard First off thank you Henrietta s Table for having a vegan option for restaurant week I love restaurant week but as a vegan it s so limiting as to which places I can go So I was super excited to see an option this year yay We went on Tuesday night my first time ever to this place Thankfully I had made reservations for 2 at 7 30pm otherwise who knows when we would have been seated there was a line and all the tables were being used We were seated immediately upon arrival Bread basket yum Love the variety of 3 breads that cranberry nut bread is delicious They serve it with a side of butter as usual Sometimes at nicer restaurants when I tell them I m vegan when I order they bring me out olive oil to use for the bread but our waitress didn t pick up on that No big deal just not giving them an above and beyond star Salads I got the spinach salad with nuts and mandarin oranges minus the cheese with the maple dressing Yummy My boyfriend got a salad with roasted tomatoes and prosciutto He enjoyed his a lot I got 2 glasses of wine throughout the night since it was restaurant week all glasses are 1 off awesome I choose to go local and drank the Rhode Island wine which was decent and cheap Boyfriend got a coke Entrees Boyfriend got the pork with a side of mash potatoes he liked it a lot I got the vegan option which is the same as the vegetarian option for restaurant week which was roasted veggies and quinoa with a side of brussel sprouts The brussel sprouts were great and come with olive oil not butter The roasted veggies with quinoa was OK I mean flavor wise it was great and again I am appreciative that I could even eat there But for a place like this I expected a better presentation It looked kind of sad All the little chopped up veggies looked like someone had just opened up a microwave bag of veggies and put them on my plate The presentation or idea could have been better for sure Desserts Boyfriend got the maple cheesecake and liked it a lot I got the sorbet and picked the chocolate yum and citrus sorbet It was good and a nice presentation Even though it was restaurant week we still spent over 100 but I am glad we finally got to experience dinner here I loved the open kitchen and the lighting and how all the tables are in the same room and it s very open But the acoustics were bad it s really loud there and hard to hear Gift shop is cute 
-owx1Yd4yYtzYNAEcsZFRA Harvard The lackluster yelp reviews almost made us stop going in but on a Sunday night at 7 30 pm in Kendall Square nothing else was open We re glad we tried it We can t quite understand the negative reviews The ingredient combinations we tried of the two pizzas we got carry out were really good Both were blackboard specials The first one was chorizo with dill pickles a surprisingly good combination while the second was a smoked salmon with creme fraiche and caper pizza My favorite was the smoked salmon so yummy The pizzas were a wee bit oiler than I would like perhaps because of our ingredient choices so deducting one star for that but if we were staying in Cambridge longer would make this one of our take out places 
-OXfriQH8je_Vah19hNMOQ Harvard My boyfriend and I finally went to The Blue Room on Friday night after hearing rave reviews from several friends Not so impressed We went at 8 30 on a Friday night and although it was surprisingly slow our service was incredibly sub par It s one of those places where you can really tell you re getting crappy service just because you didn t order a bottle of wine and one of you is a super picky eater who orders appetizers as her meal Yep that s me We did get the hummus to start with though and I barely touched it It had a weird sweetness to it that I just don t want in my hummus When we finally got our meals after everyone around us who had gotten there after us received theirs we were pleased to find out that they were really tasty despite the fact that I had to pick the goat cheese out of my dish that I specifically asked them to exclude Our waiter dropped our check onto the table without even asking us if we wanted dessert Too bad for him because I m a huge dessert eater but that was the last straw and we just wanted to leave Normally I wouldn t be so hard on a restaurant for a bad night of service but at The Blue Room it was pretty obvious that we were in the very back of our waiter s mind throughout our entire meal Not the kind of atmosphere I like Probably won t be going back 
-oYBjWVeAB6zzpGEEgu1nA Harvard This is a great place to eat The flatbread pizza is phenomenal and the wine selection is great I tell all my friends about this place 
-OzYi3VsnEz9xisag5qbUA Harvard I went for a celebration dinner One of Amy s friends was just asked to join the faculty of a major college They figured that John Harvard s would be a good choice The insides feature dark wood and sturdy chairs I loved that The menu features mostly burgers sandwiches some main dishes American food a few pizzas a few salads and bar food type appetizers Both of the ladies got salads with teriyaki chicken One made a serious dent into hers and the other finished hers off completely I love a woman who tucks into her food I asked for an Angus beef roquefort sp burger It comes with a pickle spear and steak fries I m not much of a fries kind of guy anymore but I do love steak fries especially when they are crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside These were not those fries Some were perfectly cooked others were limp and had probably been sitting around for a while I wasn t going to eat them all anyway so me picking out the ones I like worked out ok However if I were truly hungry and wanted to eat more fries I would have been super disappointed The fries were dusted with some sort of seasoning salt Probably Lawry s Chop up some garlic parsley and some parmesan and dust them in that and you would have some awesome steak fries I didn t eat the bun on my burger It was a soft bread The menu said kaiser roll but it reminded me more of potato bread The burger patty wasn t too well seasoned I asked for well done It was well done I couldn t taste the cheese at all The carmelized onions didn t do much to add to the flavor The bacon on my burger however was delicious I wish I had asked for a BLT with that bacon It would have been delicious Our waitress was pretty good about keeping glasses refilled This would be a good place for a birthday dinner I noticed a smaller dining room to the side I wanted to sit in there ha ha The pizzas and wings I saw on other tables looked delicious I think I just ordered the wrong things Prices weren t unreasonable either 
-p-R95fsWw2Qt4HNniWM9A Harvard Ah what a nice place It reminds me of a restaurant you d wander into in some little college town not a barren MIT wasteland At Emma s you can get really tasty pizza and great wine End of story A wonderful place On a Friday night my boyfriend and I shared a jug of sangria while waiting and hour for our table best restaurant wait in a long long time 
-p-vDyAXIA1t2EZPGyg6dA Harvard I really liked this bar My friend came here 15 years ago when looking at colleges and since we found ourselves back in Cambridge we decided to check it out We grabbed a seat at the bar downstairs I liked that they had Franziskaner Weissbier on draft I also got the pasta with gorgonzola sauce which was delicious I also had the bread whcih was fresh and tasty The service was great and I had an excellent time I have no beef with Grendel s so it gets a 5 I d definitely go back 
-P7XN0jiP24YeEYGv-xXgQ Harvard I loved this restaurant La Groceria is an unassuming unpretentious looking place but the food is amazing Everything I had here was phenomenal Actually reminiscing about it now makes me hungry all over again Only the dinner menu is served on Saturday unless you ask While lingering outside the restaurant trying to decide whether to go in or not and whether it was one diner friendly I read the description on the posted menu for their Grilled Shrimp dish which was only on their lunch menu It was the reason I stepped into the restaurant My waitress was so accommodating and helpful She went without complaint or hint that I was being a nuisance into the kitchen and requested the dish for me She came back saying it was no problem at all The five very large shrimp had a hint of smoky charred flavor but the shrimp itself was unblackened and tender The flavor of the shrimp was so intense These were served over a saffron risotto with peas and leeks and other deliciousness and an amaretto white zinfandel sauce I loved it 20 The almond pastry dessert I had was unbelievable Starting from the bottom there were two layers of almond infused cake separated by a thin layer of sweet almond y goodness On top of that was a thick layer of cream topped with crunchy and sweet almond bits And all of that was drizzled with caramel The size of this dessert was big enough for 4 people I wanted to eat every bite but couldn t even get through half of it The other half made for tasty dessert leftovers later that night 8 To drink the Italian mojito a mojito with a twist The twist being the essence of basil a brilliant and not too subtle enhancement of the standard mojito 9 The complimentary bread that is served after you place your order is worth a mention here I took one bite into the warm and doughy slice and raved uncontrollably about it to a passing waiter who informed me that it is baked fresh in their kitchen This bread was so soft and subtly garlicky topped with fresh tomato chunks and onions that were baked onto the bread Wow I asked for extra bread and then asked my waitress to put more in my takeout container The sparse decor is the charm of La Groceria With the afternoon sunshine streaming in through the front windows the wooden tables and chairs glow with earthy modesty and you enjoy your unbelievable meal while bathing in this simple peaceful natural light coupled with non pretentious un affected service this was better than any upscale dining experience especially on a quiet Saturday afternoon 
-pAimWGuoTaxDb3_5RO0EA Harvard It was much much better than I expected and exceeded many of the reviews I read on Yelp before going The atmosphere was typical faux Irish pub our waitress was attentive and we were endlessly entertained by the electronic trivia game board on our table I had the Reuben with a side of saut ed garlic tomato and broccoli The vegetables were tasty and cooked properly The Reuben was actually really good for a restaurant I am very biased toward the Reubens my parents make It had good sauerkraut In an ideal world this one would have a little less corned beef and a little more sauerkraut and it would have been on marble bread like the menu said instead of just straight up rye but I can t complain Boyfriend had the blueberry beer yum and the turkey burger I had a few bites and it was good but not as good as mine He said the fries were nothing special Reasonable prices and I d definitely go here again I d love to try the shepherd s pie next time 
-pBl4mN8n6hiUAxre8TjWA Harvard The idea is good but the execution was poor The food was overly salty and portions were small even for tapas standards We ordered the veggie spring rolls but they were poorly made however the dipping sauce was the only tasty element in the dish The wrap was not even tight so the fillings fell out as soon as you touched it with your chopsticks The beef noodles were flavorful but again it was overly salty and would not be a good pick for someone who is diabetic The noodles were overcooked and was soggy unlike how fresh noodles should taste if they re hand ripped The beef tongue was the only saving grace of the four dishes we ordered The last and final dish was the pork belly skewer tasteless and the sause did not compliment the meat but that s probably because the meat tasted like it was precooked and then reheated prior to serving dry and tasteless The service was sub par as well We didn t get our plates until after we started on our first dish Moreover when we were nearing the end of our meal the bus boy didn t even allow us to finish the food on our dishes and quickly cleared them away My gf and I glanced at each other and was appalled at how unaware the servers were For those who gave a rating of 3 starts or more need to get their taste buds checked Overall definitely overpriced for something you could easily make at home 
-PbsgnlaffkCKlKmMOPlLA Harvard I had the eggplant masala dosa with garlic naan delicious They have some inconspicuous seating in the back for a nice yet casual meal Still a little higher prices than I expect for take out indian food but well worth the price The only reason I didn t give it five stars was we got an online coupon for 25 dollars and the man serving us failed to tell us we could only use it once and cheated us out of five dollars we would have been happy to use on the meal knowing we wouldn t get to use it again Still great food and I will go back again I must add that the owner of this place is so rude he s almost started an altercation with my boyfriend over an online order that turned out he DID receive He s just always curt and unwelcoming not the way to treat customers I will still give them four stars because their food is scruptious 
-PC82Jh-d5YW9ERiDJNMKw Harvard Good food Had the salmon and calamari Took my wife there for Valentine s day had a three course meal with a glass of wine was awsome 
-pcXc2PHoRYRyD6sFGwnrA Harvard For years I have been told by several older people that Dolphin Seafood is excellent I finally got to go there and just kinda shrugged my shoulders after my experience The service was polite but nothing special I got a garden salad to start which was a generic salad one would expect at a random diner I got the Idaho trout picatta which was very bland compared to other picattas I ve had The trout was also very fishy tasting Sadly the best part of the meal was the crinkle fries which made me reminisce of my elementary school cafeteria days 
-Pf4V8yabNDQJn_oIAG5Ng Harvard Passed by this place It s a very cute and little crepe joint They have anything from sweet to savory crepes I had a standard crepe and it was delish I like my crepes crispy and not soft and this place did a good job Sooo basically I love this place 
-pF8xlMZdgML-T7zZIXJdA Harvard I was in town visiting some friends and we went out to Border Cafe for some margaritas and food It was pretty delicious nothing amazing but good food at a good price I m not from Boston so I think I would check out other places when I come back but that s not to say that this place shouldn t be on your list if you are looking for decent food cheap and a fun atmosphere The waitress was extremely nice prompt and courteous I had the 1 2 steak 1 2 chicken fajita which was flavored really well and cooked just right The chips and salsa were great although I would have preferred a slightly spicier salsa Drinks were okay but not too strong which was a tiny letdown but nothing drastic maybe I m just an alchy at this point and can t taste booze 
-phMx23hz4OYmyL6EPpxkw Harvard UGH I really wanted to like this place but it fell short way short So we were dying to eat here as we had heard great things about this place The only AMAZING thing about it was my cocktail which was called the Battle of Trafalgar and it was awesome The waitress told me that they are known for this drink and have won awards for it and yes it was awesome The food was not so awesome We decided to order a few of the small plates so that we could try a variety of dishes We ordered the Jonah Crab Cakes very small portion tons of mayo which overpowered the actual crab meat so all in all very disappointing Short Rib Wellington this was definitely not a short rib wellington it was more like short rib stew with a topping of pastry puff The pastry puff was dry and the short rib stew was very watery again disappointed House Charcuterie Board ugh bread that came with it was dry no mustard provided the duck ham was sliced ridiculously thin and there were about three tiny slices of it the chicken liver pate was good but I have had better basically this does not even compare to Ten Tables charcuterie plate which is plentiful with tons of extras we then ordered the Smoked Lamb Belly Toast not kidding there was no lamb belly on the toast and this was just doused in butter and really terrible I would have returned it but by that point the disappointment and disgust was overwhelming the final thing we ordered was the Crispy Soft Poached Chip In Farm Egg this was AWESOME very different filled with flavor and my husband wanted another one definitely worth ordering All in all I would come back here for a drink but not the food It is very overpriced for the quality of food that you get So disappointing 
-Pj3uJJZrpC5jLLV6K0wPQ Harvard First of all I had no idea what sort of Asian food this was We called in our order and went down to pick it up so that may have contributed to the fact that is was all cold The Mixed Teppanyaki included the tiniest piece of steak grizzle and fat and a disgusting little cube of salmon The Gado Gado had more okra than I ve ever seen who likes okra Crab Mango Salad was slimy cold with soggy fried crabs The Tamari Garden Salad soggy What a disaster 
-pjj8dKtuvhhTfD4FDlbYw Harvard We went there for restaurant week and pick from the fix menu Cheese fondue ok it did upset my stomach later on Grilled Filet Mignon I do not think that was a fillet mignon I am not sure what cut was but it was not good at all And if it was filet mignon it was the worse I ever had Chocolate fondue not impressed They could have picked better dark chocolate And the selection of fruits we had did not go well with chocolate My friend tried the lamb chops not good either It seemed little effort was put on the plates presentations And 2 same dishes looked completely different The service was good I would not go back to this place 
-pkZ5cYbHyE8Xmp5bYlXQw Harvard With the fancy burger names and the price you d expect something grand What you get is a smallish burger that while it tastes decent leaves you wanting more The fries were pretty good though No wait when we went there but it was pretty late All in all it was alright If I was in the area again I might try it again but I won t go out of my way for it If you need a bathroom to wash your hands before you eat they don t have a bathroom Walk a couple blocks over and you ll find one though 
-pn6b-PUvusRunQqtaDkTw Harvard I love eating pig and grew up in a household that had a pig roast every time there was a big celebration birthdays graduations random Sunday s in the summer etc Needless to say I have tasted a lot of damn good pork in my life but when I tell you that the smoked pork tenderloin ragu was the best pork dish I have ever tasted it is praise that I take very seriously The tenderness smokiness and sweetness of everything in the dish was magnificent I can only dream of the day when Hungry Mother turns this dish into a chewing gum so I can walk around all day tasting it rather than daydreaming of the dish everyday 
-PNNEyu0dnMawfsfqMks5g Harvard Was visiting a homesick friend in boston one weekend and i think he took me here to insure i would keep coming back to boston for visits i love places that encourages taking youre time the meal was delicious perfect for summertime when you just cant decide what you want to eat the setting was beautiful and totally charming cant wait to come back he s won this one 
-PoQa1b6Tko1rxU-IDmBmg Harvard I was visiting Boston and came here with some friends on a Saturday night for drinks Was seated promptly our server was really great Its all about their ginger ale and rum I have tasted every ginger ale known to woman and this drink is amazing The crowd each had their little nooks and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves Great fun amazing ginger ale 
-Pu6aTTVWmhjDpvjWmwC_w Harvard Went on Saturday night with a party of 6 for dinner Great ambiance and smooth service The cocktails were creative and came out fast We shared apps of oysters on the half shell lamb ribs and Gouda fries All perfect Entrees looked great and tasted better I had the pork 3 ways with polenta and my partner had the duck Sticky toffee pudding ended a perfect meal Whatever rough spots they may have had when they opened certainly have been addressed We ll be back 
-pYZHq1Jyzt1eMCdqPVbdA Harvard Thank god that Central Square finally got a sushi place so that we don t have to trek to the sushi mecca of Brookline every time we have a sushi craving We ve been here a bunch of times and the sushi is consistently pretty good while the thai food is just average not bad but nothing special They do have papaya salad on the menu which although I haven t tried yet is always a good sign You can t be a good thai place if you don t have papaya salad A few things we have tried recently Temper Tantrum roll I like that this tuna roll has a little spice but isn t mixed with mayo like most spicy tuna type rolls which coincidentally usually aren t usually spicy either We like this so much that we got 2 of them last time Mack the Knife yellowtail with more chili sauce the last time it wasn t as spicy but still pretty good Sleeping Beauty roll great except that the lime mayo or whatever it was that decorated the top sort of overwhelmed the flavors Avocado veggie fresh rolls really good but I wish you got more than 2 for 7 or 8 Sweet Potato roll I was so sad about this one because usually I love everything with sweet potatoes especially sushi but this fell short really short It s a tempura roll and the roll ended up being mostly tempura breading instead of sweet potato Disappointing considering that they don t have a ton of interesting veggie sushi options 
-q406BY420Ez3DS0AU2L6Q Harvard Solid food here Not too many places where you can get dinner for 5 or less and be filled up Oh and this place isn t Taco Bell Genuine Mexican right near the Kenmore Square stop I wish that they could sell Dos Equis or Corona here 
-qaiFtkN9ZzAoVLFiwK39A Harvard Highlight Watching a 12 year old approach the grill with a bowl filled with corn kernels and raw bacon Lowlight Trying to eat enough to make up for the 17 price tag I think the spiced tuna has the biggest price per pound on the buffet Strange conclusion I really want to go back I keep thinking of new exciting things to do with corn and bacon 
-qBIZK31ZZ6edlrrCjxswA Harvard I ordered off the 50 menu includes an appetizer entree dessert and wine pairing with each course and my boyfriend had the spring rolls and Duck Duck Goose The food was great delicious ingredients combined with a creative flair Unfortunately the wait service was so horrible that my boyfriend and I spent more time bewildered by the treatment we were receiving than savoring our meals We were seated by the waitress stand ie where they enter their orders and collect silverware napkins Seating has never been an issue before as we are a laid back couple with usually nothing to complain about but our waitress spent the whole time gathering supplies while taking our order I think I only saw her face once She brought my wine late with each course and never told me what I was drinking Although she attempted to be friendly when speaking with us she was so rushed that I had the impression we were nothing but a bother to her My boyfriend had to request silverware from separate wait staff whenever our food arrived and he had to flag our waitress down for a second beverage after waiting for over 15 minutes for her to stop by It s too bad that the service was so horrible because as gathered from reading the other reviews we could have had a great time This was our worst dining experience in Boston to date 
-Qc1ZYesX5h-4tiGTqNSdA Harvard This place has great potential and is in a great location but they still have a lot of room to grow I went here on a Thursday night around 7pm with a big group of college friends The wait staff seemed overwhelmed by our group and was not crazy about giving us a table in the dining room Some of us wanted to eat dinner some didn t I totally understand and wanted to make sure the waitress got a fair tip at the end Although the service was fine the waitress was pretty rude and annoyed the entire time Also the food was wayyy overpriced and not that good Her attitude made us uncomfortable so we all quickly ate our dinners and moved back over to the bar The restaurant was not crowded at all so I m not sure why this girl was in such a hot rush to get rid of us But whatever We moved back to the bar which by the way is a very small area Their dining room takes up about 75 of the space and the bar takes up the other 25 The space is so small that everyone was trickling into the dining area This obviously made the on edge hostesses very angry and they kept reminding everyone to stay inside the bar parameters I m sorry we re giving you business right If we bother you so much then maybe we can just go somewhere else o k Overall it was a sub par experience There are too many good bars and restaurants in Cambridge to waste my time and hard earned dollars at this place 
-qcZza5lP-c-CyfsISbcuw Harvard Finale tries hard to be a European cafe and bakery Nice try bad execution Even though the little cakes are good the last two times I went with friends I was disappointed This is unfortunately consistent 1 Coffee served lukewarm 2 Salad leaves old and brownish 3 Service slow unfriendly leaving tables uncleared 4 Interior ok but why do you need to put ugly promotion stickers on your windows Finale wants to be too many things to too many people If that continues to be the non concept it s gonna be a quick Finale Good luck 
-qDBl7IMGl3XNUgxVdqsFQ Harvard I went and the drinks were great expensive the food was not great I enjoyed the squash raviolis and the parsnip puree Honestly though that was it The staff was GREAT Very helpful But the food not so much 
-qDMCp-I9mSkYh5YquNrgg Harvard Food is not outstanding But is very consistent 
-QDQ5yyTxoGpFVqWUQpm3w Harvard I ve been here a good handful of times now and found their previous menu to be an absolute steal The ambiance of this restaurant leaves something to be desired but it is still a perfectly nice place to have dinner with some friends Service can be shaky at times but they do aim to please As another yelper mentioned they recently updated their menu and pricing From what we were told on our last visit they were actually losing a lot of money with the previous pricing structure The prices have jumped a lot I ordered the beef tenderloin for 22 Friends ordered the pizza for 7 which is an app but worked very well as a dinner Most of the prices range in between those two amounts I feel bad the staff is taking a lot of heat for the change that they really had nothing to do with We were all happy with the quality of the food and the attention we received from the staff there 
-qhMFbo7I2qrJKZRiZ2YDg Harvard Went back with a gift card Service was substantially better We shared the asparagus small plate delicious perfectly cooked with crispy cippolini onions and parmesaen cheese calamari and the special sweet potato hash with a fried egg and spinach salad with pickled onions Yum Still pretty chilly in there and so loud but I think it s the acoustics of the place high ceilings with copper tiles And also the lack of raw oysters I was craving them and we figured we d use our GC and get oysters in 1 fell swoop 
-qk-TpoZ-3ckRLeqhdZgWQ Harvard Visited on a Saturday night with two friends We were seated immediately They have a cool fish tank my friend remarked that one of the fishes looked pregnant and the overall look is pretty neat I ordered the Crispy Chicken Basil which was covered in spinach basil and green pepper and garnished with red beet peels The dish did not include rice to my surprise and the overall flavor could have benefited from more spice A shaker of crushed red peppers would have been nice I probably should ve asked The steam from the vegetables drained to the bottom of the dish and the chicken got slightly soggy My friends enjoyed their meals although one was left unappetized and wanted more I m definitely ordering something spicier next time but I think my next experience will turn out better 
-QkRD03ZLdawG0lFAR5CSw Harvard Spices are expensive at the grocery store It usually costs you 7 average per small ass jar bottle Now Shalimar is the solution to your problem All spices are dirt f in cheap Big ass bag of curry power for a few bucks And also watch out the chilli powder Its hotness is quite lethal I love it though 
-qkynTd5cLtJnGzCG7TBMA Harvard This place sucks Miracle of Science refers to the process by which most of the patrons were created because there s no way on earth that such nerds could have been formed by sexual procreation But I digress The staff is rude and ignorant of both science and hospitality so I have no reservations about trashing this place on Yelp Why it is still in business is a miracle of its own This place caters to the high tech biotech crowd that loves their beer I know because I was one of them once upon a time and to my former lab nerds who are no doubt either a wasting time at work or b laid off for the nth time because biotech companies are run by incompetent and or greedy bastards who prey on the nerdy let me extend a big hello and say to you yes I do feel your pain You are not alone 3 2 1 Contact fooled a lot of us into believing that we should devote our lives to finding cures for diseases that only the people in finance will be able to afford But someday one of us will invent a time machine that will take us back to our misspent youth i e college and we ll set ourselves straight and not let our younger selves waste time studying organic chemistry But I digress Although by the time one is promoted from RA I to RA II in this town our well respected almost 30 something scientists know enough to hit up the bars where they can meet people who ve never ordered anything out of the VWR catalogue Maybe someone in an evening MBA program at Brandies And that s probably a good thing for the gene pool Did I mention the Miracle of Science sucks It s wicked hot in there in the summertime because the architects botanists science enthusiasts who designed the place modeled it after a god damn greenhouse Genius And I agree with whats his face who says that you pay an atmosphere tax to hang here Yeah atmosphere measured to be approximately 0 ATM Giggle at that ya nerds And no there s nothing scientific about the place The name is a gimmick I know like the 21st Amendment over in Beacon Hill but minus the wit What I would like to know is why aren t there bars in the financial district such as Soulless Moneygrubbers etc But I digress Um this place sucks Peace 
-qlMyO4etK4Mxpomnzc3mg Harvard I used to love this place but it s lost it luster over the years The concept is what originally drew me in I could pick out the meat veggies and sauce for my dish That was an almost foolproof guarantee that I will like my food right Eh not so much Even if you can pick the ingredients you still can t pick how it is cooked Major props to the guys who work the grill and have to keep everything in check but that is where everything starts to go downhill First of all my meat is always overcooked To the point where it is tough to chew Because of how long my meat is sitting on the grill my veggies and noodles also get charred in the process Also did you really just use the same spatula to cook everyone s food No wonder why my teriyaki sauce tastes like it is mixed with curry sauce some person before me had curry as their sauce and I m sure the person after me has my teriyaki sauce remnants all over their food as well Also when it gets REALLY busy and the poor cooks have like 30 things cooking at once good luck getting your food in a timely manner I spend about 10 minutes standing for each minute of actual eating Not a very good ratio IMO Also beware of their really big fishbowl giant margarita glass drinks It is about 90 ice and as a result the libation is seriously watered down However even the watered down version will knock you on your ass So keep that in mind the next time you think you can drink a whole one by yourself 
-qNDeYHHblPYvJ0syb8g6A Harvard I wish I would have read the reviews on here before going to this place for a takeout The place looks like a dump inside with all kinds of old junk all over the place The pastries look like they were just dumped into the counter The takeout menu that I got had stains on it I ordered eggs came with toast and potatoes and a pancake and it was all put into the same container with syrup I asked for a bag and got some wrinkly plastic bag that was probably already used 10 times 
-QRTnkZDc3EosB9Zxel5YQ Harvard Ok so it s finally time I put together my thoughts on Tommy Doyles I have been here almost a dozen independent occasions and my conclusion is that it sucks really hard It s always crowded A meat market Faneul Hall sort of crowded You have to push through the crowd to get in you have to wait to get upstairs you have to push through to get to the bar you have to push through to the dancefloor A meat market environment is never complete without a heaping spoonful of college douche bags All of these pleasantries are set in dark hideous decor The best music is on Fridays which is 90 s hip hop which is poorly delivered I have also had the food which is sub par Greasy shepards pie And the one time I got a salad it took 30 American minutes to arrive only after I badgered my waiter because he had forgotten The bar is staffed sparingly and ensures that regardless of time of day there is a huge crowd of people at the bar and your drink takes forever All of this is yours for a small fee of 3 Lets summarize Crowded Unpleasant patrons Ugly decor and poor lighting Insufficient bar staff Forgetful wait staff Bad music Oh and a staircase that s a lawsuit waiting to happen Yes I have fallen down it 
-Qt_dsLeDVuza-JgTPJqqQ Harvard Thanks to my Yelp friend Melissa M I discovered this wonderful world of delicious fast food I ve only tried the veggie burgers and french fries and their homemade lemonade but they are SO GOOD I normally don t get to go to Harvard Square for lunch sadly and am also on a diet So I can only come here on my Saturday cheat days now on my non cheat days I daydream about those yummy veggie burgers and fries I gotta get myself over there on a Saturday soon 
-QuHSrejlUf0dE8oMhMzrQ Harvard Pizza isn t bad but geez waiting over an hour for delivery getting the wrong pizza then waiting another full hour for the right one Not so good 
-QuQbocAKpu5Vd2DoMeRFA Harvard Cheap quick and delicious the workweek lunch holy trinity If you re there after noon you might be put off by the number of people waiting but trust me it is the quickest long line you will ever wait in They are ridiculously efficient I once ordered realized I had left my wallet in my office and they told me that I could pay the next day Where else do you get that kind of treatment Everyone seems to like the banh mi but my favorite is the ga nuong with vermicelli and a small chicken pho They run out of vermicelli pretty quick every day so make sure you hit up the truck before 1pm 
-qX8PCA-hdpgojdGMrDSDg Harvard Rendesvouz occupies a former Burger King spot which is oddly apparent the moment you enter see the sloped glass ceiling at the front of the dining room and the open kitchen at the back While they ve spruced the place up with low lighting and a rich paint job it still has a bit of an odd quick serve restaurant feel they should really rethink the view through kitchen idea because that adds to it Design oddities aside the menu service and food were superb We started off with a crisp bottle of L Ecole Semillon and a few slices of fresh country bread just like they serve in France crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside In fact the little French touches like the linen dish towel napkins almost made me forget we were dining at the former BK Lounge But then the real food arrived and this is no burger joint Thanks to the prix fixe special they were running I was talked into a 3 course feast starting with a delicious summer salad thin cucumber slices black olives tomatos feta and lots of mint then moving to a roasted chicken breast with green beans and new potatoes and wrapping up with a fluffy lemony pudding concoction My dining companion started with a tuna ceviche moved on to haddock in a basil pesto olive broth and finished with an orange polenta cake with berries The prices were reasonable and each course was absolutely delicious Our server was also great she was super attentive and knew the menu and recipes inside out Rendevouz s website is also pretty interesting it s a blog On it they provide standard restuarant site fare location hours reservation info etc plus the wine list recipes and info on creators of the art work currently gracing their walls But because it s a blog management can easily update the content as menus or artwork changes and patrons can easily leave comments Although the navigation is wonky on the secondary pages and the restaurant name is conspicuously absent from the header it s kind of a nice approach 
-raxMjnkboh9RxBFRETV_Q Harvard It s a little odd how they do the whole ordering thing here slightly overwhelming for a first time diner but the food is fresh and the atmosphere is hipper than thou 
-RBv8u3NEtOFlq-RV5Idug Harvard I wanted to love this place I really did But not so much Here s why We came here on a fairly busy day 1 1 2009 Everyone needs food to sop up their hangovers from the night before and we were no exception There was a wait for a table so we decided to sit at the counter After a fairly extensive delay the obviously harried waitress took our orders The coffee was actually quite decent The spanikopita however was most decidedly not The phyllo dough was noticeably stale and had clearly been made some time ago stored in the freezer then reheated quickly Our food took quite some time to come out and when the waitress said we re just waiting on the omelet my heart sank Sure enough when the omelet came out hot and fresh the turkey club was cold Not lukewarm cold Fries too Ever had toasted bread that s been allowed to go completely cold It s like eating a handful of broken glass I actually sustained an internal injury from the bread No joke cut the inside of my mouth all to shit We paid and got the eff out If we come back which I doubt we ll sit at a table and try ordering some of the recommended dishes other Yelpers have raved about Unfortunately my experience with Zoe s wasn t up to the usual Yelp 4 or 5 star snuff But maybe they can redeem 
-rh9nw2NVfkAjzjmiKDoHg Harvard I go there at least twice a week for lunch and their gyro is the shit They use the right amount of dressing for their salads the fries are awesome and the second you walk in and tell them what you want it s ready within seconds They aren t pricey and you get a ton of food in your order 
-rHwnEsdozf5894oV-J5jQ Harvard My fiance and I were in Harvard for the day and were looking to grab some lunch and cocktails We came across Russell House Tavern and decided to give it a shot We walked in to find only two patrons in the entire restaurant and they were sitting at the bar We asked the hostess for a table for two to which she responded For what My fiance responded some drinks and maybe some food she then berated us and decided to speak to he and I as though we were children She said that the tables were only for those who wished to eat food and that if we decided to sit at a table we would be encouraged to have something to eat as only patrons eating were allowed to sit at the tables There was NO ONE in the restaurant We had every intention of eating there but this woman s attitude was just too much We finally did sit at a table and quickly realized the reason she was pushing the food it s because their menu is TERRIBLE We walked out quickly after we saw our poor food options I do not recommend this restaurant if the food looked even remotely appetizing we gladly would have stayed but due to poor atmosphere and waitstaff we made the proper decision and brought our business across the street to a lovely restaurant called Tory Row Having been in the restaurant business I know the appropriate way to greet and seat guests and this woman was the polar opposite of the correct way to do her job Do not waste your time with this place unless you like to be treated like garbage 
-Ri1ljrAFhOtDbW289XoFw Harvard Love love love Otto Pizza Thin crust scrumptious sauce high quality cheese and inventive toppings Swoon Sometimes the only thing getting me through the week are dreams of Friday evening which will invariably involve a couple of Ottos eggplant ricotta basil squash ricotta cranberries a bottle of Italian red wine and a catastrophic episode of MI 5 on Netflix The only caveat they don t deliver and driving to Harvard Square is a team effort requiring two people on a Friday night so you can just pull up and not have to find a nonexistent parking spot Please Otto get with it and get a few delivery people 
-RKf3Y0PYUPTN6AWDpV6kw Harvard Tr ta has become one of my favorite places for dinner in Cambridge Food quality is consistently high and there is a nice selection of local New England beers on tap which makes me happy This weekend we enjoyed entrees from the specials menu a risotto w salmon haddock and a salmon salad Both were prepared well tasty and satisfying Regular menu offerings are familiar but better than pub grub or American chain restaurants I would not call it a pizza place though reviewers sing praises of their brick oven pizzas Nor is it an Irish pub in the usual sense despite the Irish name Tr ta and the comforting lilt you may hear on the tongues of restaurant staff and regulars at the bar Tr ta Kitchen Bar is indeed the best definition I love that Tr ta is fairly quiet so I can enjoy conversation without shouting though I have seen it crowded once or twice The vibe feels like a warmly decorated neighborhood hang and not as much a destination for chatty young college students the bar hopping social set or throngs of tourists or maybe I m just here on the early side In any case I hope Tr ta stays just as it is for many years to come

-RZukizwbKb5ARrkCVmnLQ Harvard Super cheap large slices of pizza Nothing fancy but get the job done I prefer this place to Pinnochio s regular just because the base is so much thinner at Angelo s Decor is a total turn off But fortunately as there is nothing else next door we still ventured in 
-r_BH1v9pHSng1rf1Xe26w Harvard Typical Americanized Chinese food Greasy hot and fast The delivery is consistently fast but don t order a can of soda from them When I do they have literally forgotten it 2 3 of the time They always go back and get it but when you re in a 4th floor walk up you re faced with the unenviable choice of going back up to wait for them only to have to make another round trip or waiting on the stoop while smelling your food Ridiculous they can t remember this 50 of the time I order from here the meat is fresh tender and excellent 50 of the time it s just awful in some way Sometimes I get nothing but dark meat somethings it s all cartilage with hardly any meat at all and other times it s a mystery as to exactly what it is I have not problem recommending them though because they are pretty cheap and very fast PS I HATE that the giant Koi in the tank by the counter is being tortured It needs 400x as much water as it has to thrive Very uncool

-S06aviRCPTBEtLcK6T5Kg Harvard Amazing I was worried that I wouldn t be able to adequately explain how incredibly rude a staff person was so rude in fact that at first I thought he was just joking and then thought maybe this was a stunt for a hidden camera program However now that I ve read the other reviews I realize I am not alone and that I m not imagining that the service has gotten increasingly discourteous over the last several months There s clearly no need now to go into excruciating detail which is good because I d rather not get angry all over again so I ll just cut to the chase In the initial encounter I had tried to order a curried chicken sandwich that I d often ordered over the years and was told with great nastiness that no I couldn t have mayo with that even on the side No see you re trying to get around what I said because that s not how the chef wanted it served I finally just walked out of the restaurant without ordering Then I realized that the staff person a tall French guy had made me so mad that he had ruined a perfectly lovely summer day So I turned around and went back And in a steady low key voice I said I realized that your arrogance and rudeness left a sour taste in my mouth so I just came back to tell you that He replied that he wasn t arrogant continued to respond in a rude manner and then ended by getting on one knee arms open wide a la Al Jolson I swear and said I apologize Is this what you wanted I replied You know that s NOT what I meant Then I left I am over 60 have lived in Cambridge over 20 years have also lived in Wash DC LA and NYC for years and can truthfully say I have never ever experienced the level of intentional rudeness I encountered at the Blacksmith Bakery I usually give waitstaff the benefit of the doubt and sometimes even try to break a little discourtesy with You ve had a rough day haven t you which usually does it But this was different At the Blacksmith they seem to delight in being rude to customers Would someone please buy out whoever now owns the bakery so I can return to what used to be a real haven on a gorgeous day in Cambridge Judy R 
-s0vsmrQn1qplVTdNisDUw Harvard I m from new york so i adore pizza I know it s super stereotypical but whatever ANYWAY Pinocchio s makes some of the best Sicilian pizza I ve had outside of my home state The sauce is tangy and fresh tasting the cheese is great as is the crust I m sort of torn between them and shock shock Regina s in the North End but Pinocchio s is closer so when I have a pizza jonesing I totally hit them up For the record I like both their regular pies as well as Sicilian

-SbdN77FSLnHkignpqj60Q Harvard Came here at the suggestion of gentlemen I met over at Russell House Tavern a nearby gastropub in Harvard Square I swung by this place for drinks one night and came back the next to try the food The rooftop patio is really nice weather permitting You can see some of the nearby buildings from the roof which add some character and it s like nothing I m used to being from Los Angeles I really enjoyed the salmon special A good sized perfectly cooked filet along with rice and veggies Damn I m actually salivating thinking about it right now as I write this here catching up on reviews in a Delta Sky Club The trail mix and cookies aren t quite as up to par 4 stars since we were charged too much for the food we ordered We were in a rush and didn t have time to argue over it

-SGKEyOcIg1Oz7dSlVuLjw Harvard I love CBC s Great Pumpkin Ale I have for years It s the reason I was so excited to try their Wilson spiced pumpkin porter and their Belgian style pumpkin beer It s the reason my buddy and I decided to brave a torrential downpour and haul ourselves over here through the muck But as has happened before we got there and they were out of their own beer Out of the porter Out of the Belgian one I mean c mon did you honestly think people wouldn t like them That we re all here for the food or something We were not It s average If you had asked me that night I d have given them one star but I ve cooled down a bit And their beer WHEN IT S AVAILABLE is fantastic But if you re looking forward to trying a particular brew call ahead Their website is no help it said available today on draft which was clearly not the case 
-sgYMkFrlmZZeO-12Aa8vQ Harvard Con Sol was not like I expected after reading the review on Boston com It was a little small but quite pleasant We started with the octopus salad the chorizo the shrimp and the cod fish cakes Sirloin steak paella and a bottle of red wine for 84 I felt we got a good deal for the amount of food something that can turn me off of a place if I feel we overpaid The service was fine and we really did enjoy 
-sJyd_8de7ZX0RH8mdu8Sw Harvard This place is exclusively patronized by non Cambridge folk or some of the rubes at the College The food is terrible and the drinks underwhelming The sole strong point is that if you have a huge and unwieldy group of people you can come here and get seated 
-So5hB_VmJ5bYgI5Ax8GFw Harvard Meh Food is average for the price and I have to say Om I am just not that into you I am shocked you are still open 
-SOBA-7clUPdO6WlgWj3UA Harvard This place just opened a few months ago It s conveniently located right near where I catch the bus so I can grab a drink if I have an extra 10 minutes before it comes Their ginger lemonade is killer and I really like their various sandwiches Try either the tabouli wrap or the turkey apple brie Their croissants are awesome warmed too The atmosphere is great They have free wifi also so it s a good homework spot The patio is in a decent location aside from some of the obnoxious street performers My beef with this place is that they don t accept cards for purchases under 10 so you re only option is to deposit at least 10 onto a gift card The card s rechargeable which is good but it s just a bummer for those who don t go regularly 
-SOrePKpA96J--7cuOHndA Harvard Not just a decent sushi place but a nice Japanese restaurant It s very convenient to Boston University right by the Kenmore Square stop on the Green Line The sushi is good But much as I love sushi I usually don t order it here Instead I go for the Beef Don great thin sliced steak and onions the deep fried pork rolls are delicious and the Idaho Maki sweet potato tempura roll is the best I ve ever had But my favorite thing here is the beef dumpling soup For 3 95 you get a fairly big bowl of hot mildly spicy broth some carrot shavings and four or five good sized dumplings which should be slurped loudly while being bitten into That s a terrific value especially in a cold Boston winter The location is great the decor is interesting and the food is terrific Easily worth four stars plus a bit

-sWCaMxx8emOa_uqFTJNEA Harvard I got take out from Thailand Cafe my very first day in Cambridge I had been moving boxes all day long and had yet to go to the grocery store and having lived in Thai saturated neighborhoods for seven years it was a natural thing for me to do to order Thai food when I was hungry and had nothing to eat I looked around online and was a bit taken aback by how expensive Thai food was in general compared to NY 10 vs 7 and then found Thailand Cafe which has more reasonable prices My roommate tried to warn me that this might not be the best place to order from but I thought eh how bad can it be Bad I ordered drunken noodles or whatever they call this dish and the noodles were rubbery and all stuck together in one clump The vegetables did not seem fresh there was virtually no basil and generally the dish was lacking flavor Hands down worst Thai food I ve ever eaten the only reason I m not giving it one star is because I feel badly doing that after only one experience and when others seem to think this place has some merit but my food was so bad that I m not sure I can bring myself to go back I d rather pay 3 more and get food that is remotely enjoyable I m surprised to see so many four star reviews of Thailand Cafe 
-sWgCQFRx_RgHV6ZbACzkw Harvard First off no pickles in the establishment I was told they have cucumber Not the same thing Humus was yummy and garlicy but flavor was drowned by insane amount of red onion Falafel was a multicultural experience served in tortilla rather than pita hot sauce was sriracha iceberg lettuce from cali speculation Falafel itself was strangely familiar on third bite or so I recognized it from the boxed Fantastic brand I make at home parsley and deep fryer The guy was nice and service was super quick but he put an entire red onion s worth of bad breath on the sandwich Ugh 
-SX_NqmIbRhDql9Brs0zXQ Harvard Aight here s the run down So my friends and I were in Cambridge after a meeting trying to figure out what to eat We were in the Garage Mall caught between Subways Pho Le s and a healthy looking burrito place Little did I personally know that there was a mexican place down the stairs I got the XL steak burrito which was pretty good similar to that of Boloco s What I like best about this place was the condiments they had available to the customers Lemons sauces onions jalapenos etc I love adding more flavor onto my food and Felipe s gives me that opportunity versus Boloco s I squeezed atleast 10 little slices of lemon the spicy glazed onions and had super hot sauce dumped in thanks to my friend The atmosphere was homy and it s quite small I like this place a lot and will probably be my new place to grub when I m at Harvard 
-sZODS10ZxhYsXNZ-Eoy4A Harvard We came here today and I was very impressed I m a bit skeptical when it comes to chain restaurants but the service was good the food was good and we got a table straight away The only thing holding me back from giving a 5 is that my appetizer was well tiny to say the least Almost needed a microscope to see it The meal was tasty and filling without leaving that sickly bloated feeling I m a bit of a sweet tooth so I made sure I had room for dessert I had the red velvet cheesecake which was amazing comparable to the Cheesecake Factory

-TagNMcAfgQrnT741OAkIw Harvard Came here for a little college friend reunion which was a party of about 20 people Seeing friends was nice and all but the best part about having that many people was the fact that we ordered 3 towers of beer The ones that stood out was the Great Pumpkin ale and the Punjabi Pumpkin The first was well rounded and the second was uniquely spiced Food was okay but I think people come here for their brews All I can remember was that they had good nachos Hope that helps 
-Tb3ADaTO3LZK3Fg_bkvcA Harvard Great atmosphere love the upstairs with the high ceilings Great location in an historic building The food I had was tasty if on the oily side and the iced coffee was very nice Price high but service accommodating and no pressure so you really could hang out here for hours working on that dissertation 
-TCARLe_fTvUOrHnnC9XWg Harvard I was looking forward to try this place but I have to say the ones Ive tried in London are far better The main reason for this is very simple Better ingredients and concept of service in most Europe and Asia higher standards if u will u get my drift Newayz M happy to see this int l chain finally in the US The concept is very simple clean and fresh with enough choice of noodles from Soba to Udon Food very good and in decent portions My friend and I tried the ebi kare lomen and the yasai chilli men v which were both quite good accompanied some hot sake which definately kicked things up a notch in the bitter cold Service was not good at all my waitress was taking frequent trips to La La land the only thing I liked about the service was that the server could swipe my card by means of a hand held device which also noted our order by the way The decor is very cool casual modern open oriental contemporary cafeteria feel but I can understand some people not liking this because they arent used to it in the US For desert the ginger cheescake was subtle and dense and actually quite good w some hot tea I would go here again but with so many choices in great japanese thai malaysian food in Boston now M less likely to go often 
-TCTn0mwl_3VcD9Koh_yAA Harvard There is very little to fault PARK on After a few visits I think it is my new go to in Harvard Square First the cheese spread is amazing It comes out with these great crackers that are light and airy So much better than plain old bread and butter My favorite app was the crispy mussels with preserved lemon were phenomenal and came in the cutest presentation The brisket the steak the salmon the scallops all were amazing Everything is always cooked perfectly The cocktails are inventive and delicious The servers are knowledgeable and timely Park is also really comfortable No loud music although the music is good comfy seating servers that don t rush you out The only place to fault PARK is the dessert The pie filling was great the crust was rock hard and flavorless Amp up the pie and you are a 5 star joint 
-tD3KoWuxKnsr8fId_j-uA Harvard On the plus side they are fast for delivery and cheap I like their specialty sandwiches the chicken caesar salad and their broiled steak plate and I second the guy who praised them for carrying Orangina Mm Orangina On the negative their pasta dishes are bland and uninspired The garlic bread is conversely overwhelming put the remains AND the packaging in the outside trash immediately or you will smell garlic for days In summary I don t make a habit of eating here but it s good once in a while for takeout 
-tdX3NU8hCHede22lIr2Sg Harvard I used to order delivery from here all the time I really miss this place especially the fried ravioli For some reason i never found anything else that was really so good here but the fried ravioli was so amazing Great place if you are at MIT delivers until late

-TfG7pWiN7hq29PlWbaK9g Harvard I took my wife here for her birthday She said the duck is very well known here and she wanted to try it She told me I had to reserve the duck when making the reservation When we sat down the waitress came over to tell us that the duck on the menu is not longer available I panicked and remember that I reserved the duck when making the appointment She went to check her reservation list and came back and said my duck is waiting for me in the kitchen The wait for the duck is long 1hr later it finally came out It looks stunning Everyone in the restaurant stared at the duck when it came out of the kitchen It truely is delicious My wife was very amazed that there was very little bones on the duck I wasn t a big fan of the dessert or appetizer

-tP__hSRhbffpcUiLCn38Q Harvard 5 of us went here for dinner on 6 18 11 The food was all fresh and anything one of us didn t like was all on us as we picked out the meats pastas veggies and sauces The grill did an alright job cooking everything my steak was a bit overdone for my liking but not horrible The waitress was slow and inattentive We had to track her down for drinks and the dessert menu My biggest complaint was the cleanliness of the place or rather the lack of cleanliness While food stations and dishes all appeared clean the amount of I am assuming spills that do not get taken care of was ridiculous Our feet stuck to the floor no matter where we stood or walked The counter around the grill was covered in a sticky mess all the way around and our table was sticky as well My guess is that there were a few slobs that spilled and rather than clean up the spills they were just getting spread aound with damp dirty mops and rags No matter how clean it might have been there the fact that I almost lost a sandal to the goo when waiting for my food to finish cooking was enough to turn me off of future visits If we were to try this place again it would be in the afternoon and hopefully not covered in sticky stuff yet 
-tRCjAZpzV5943W4GS4sEA Harvard Perhaps those who are new to Shabu are excited about this place but to be honest I think it s only fair to rate this restaurant in comparison to other places in town such as Shabu Zen given that the concept and even their menu pretty much mimics Shabu Zen Some issues we had with the place 1 They are inconsistent with the amount of meat and veggies they give you For example I ordered the same meat dish as my friend and got a few pieces less than they did The server was not at all apologetic about the oversight This inconsistency happened both times I have gone there 2 They tout that they provide unlimited veggies which we were really excited about seeing that this feature was something that other shabu places did not have However when asked whether you could have four more pieces of tofu the server replied hm well I can t really give you that many I ll give you this much drops three pieces in NOTE this was after I didn t have the correct amount of tofu pieces in the initial veggie plate It made for a really awkward situation because we didn t want to be demanding yet they had just told us that it was unlimited I think management needs to be more consistent with what they tell their servers to say and do 3 Then the server asked us how we liked their service Even more awkward 4 The broth was not flavorful enough I really wanted this place to do well and really do hope they change for the better If not I m not confident it will survive As for now me and my friends and family will continue to go to Shabu Zen 
-tV_gQi30FvpQ4-zAvE3JQ Harvard Been here for work parties and always end up trashed in a good way The only reason they get 4 stars and not 5 is there horrible excuse for a bathroom on the THIRD floor So not fun after drinking the night away on the FIRST floor I have been 5 times and every time they are out of TP or the soap is low or the water is cold Kinda nasty but when you re trashed and drinking on the company dollar you can overlook that

-txZSDnS3ziRq3zd8g3EIQ Harvard I had just about given up on the Harvard Square bar scene when a friend and I stumbled upon this place late last summer We were pleasantly surprised by the beer selection while they only have 10 12 beers on tap at a given time they re always an interesting and quality collection I highly recommend the Drifter IPA by Widmer Brothers Brewing If you like IPAs you won t be disappointed Despite being quite crowded on a Friday night we managed to find a place to sit outside at one of the wooden tables and could actually hear each other talk On another occasion I sat downstairs at the bar with a friend for several hours where it is significantly less crowded but the scene may not be as busy And on yet another occasion I came with a group of 8 and managed to snag a booth upstairs but I will warn everyone that there aren t many booths available on a weekend night Now when I have a friend in town who appreciates good beer instead of reluctantly going to John Harvard s or Charley s Beer Garden I ll happily take them to Daedalus and pass several hours there What an excellent way to spend an evening 
-u-dPwin0r5klIMKVCHXvA Harvard This is probably my equivalent of Cheeseboard in Berkeley CA Ok fine the only thing those two places have in common is that they both serve very good pizza by the slice Anyway I really enjoyed the mango on pulled pork which is what I got I tried a bite of the butternut squash too and it too was delicious I like their thin crust I hate when the pizza crust is so thick that it ends up filling me up I also feel like the oil content is just enough to make the pizza taste good but not to the point that I feel guilty for clogging up my arteries I heard that the pizzas on sale by the slice rotate whenever they run out so I m hoping to see other toppings the next time I drop by The crowds seem to go in waves at this place sometimes I see a lot of people eating waiting to get their pizza and sometimes the place is empty But the waves come and go quickly I don t believe you ever have to wait too long Like other reviews don t really expect to find seating here It s basically just a storefront I think there are a few chairs inside facing the street but I don t know if people even bother sitting I like grabbing it to go and eating it on the walk back to school 
-u40TqR_UXuyC0ODEszKNw Harvard Irish pubs such as the Asgard don t really do it for me probably because I have spent so much time in Ireland and prefer the real deal when it comes to the pub scene And Asgard is not the real deal The atmosphere is pleasant and the servers are mostly ok but the food seems rather average and the place just feels a bit too generic to me For a fun night at an authentic Irish pub I guess I d rather hit a place such as James s Gate in Jamaica Plain The Druid in Inman Square or O leary s in Brookline 
-uCdYnb4j4EuUJjIZwHOoA Harvard Cafe Pamplona has good espresso drinks and sandwiches albeit a little overpriced They certainly mimic inadvertently the Spanish cafe service meaning you need to flag down your waiter to get the bill or to order more food not that this is a bad thing it allows you to be undisturbed while working chatting etc Overall I wasn t blown away by the infamous Cafe Pamplona that many an indie kid has praised but I d go back for their Chocolate Mousse 
-uEXzM0rXicatkodA4Vkhg Harvard Not the place to go if you want stellar service but that s OK the food makes up for it and it s part of the ambiance Not the place to go if you need to pee either by the way but that s OK the coop is right next door Try the burgers They are great try the french fries and you will die a happy person I guarantee it 
-Ug2Q50-6Eo8PeSRQmMfqQ Harvard While the food here is decent and deserves a solid 3 or 4 stars the 1 star rating reflects their poor customer service I got through the long line to order my sandwich a chicken sandwich special minus the bacon I informed the guy that I have a severe food allergy and as such I would like my sandwich whole uncut with the knife that cuts every other sandwich including ones that could kill me He says ok and proceeds to make my sandwich and cut it Upon my protest he proceeds to take new bread and just move all the fillings over When I stopped him and reminded him that the reason I had ordered the sandwich uncut was a food allergies and that I needed a completely new sandwich he got flustered and proceeded to try to hand me the cross contaminated sandwich repeatedly Finally one of the other guys changed his gloves and made the sandwich with bacon Sadly I will not be returning to Kendall Kitchen due to the rude attitudes wrong order and time wasted trying to explain food allergies 
-UP_jzWzttpYPqw8QUBUiA Harvard I love the original Greek Corner so I was excited to visit the new and more easily accessible Greek Corner II The food was good The first time I went I got the Egg Lemon soup exact same as the original location Tonight I went and got the Chicken Kabob with Greek fries and a salad I love their Greek fries although I think they are a little better at Mass Ave more herbs and cheese The chicken was also slightly different not in taste but in the way it was cooked and prepared more veggies smaller pieces of meat I was disappointed that they didn t have their Greek Frappe coffee While the staff was incredibly nice the place is small and seems dirty Yes they were washing the floors when I was there but it still seemed dingy and a little gross Oh and did I mention HOT Find a bench and enjoy your Greek food elsewhere 
-URDpFuU9-9iD-T3DLd_HA Harvard I waited to write a review until I completed my own personal Triple Crown Treble Tricycle at this restaurant 1 brunch 2 dinner and 3 the burger at the bar The summary of this review is CoM is a spectacular restaurant The passion for their food permeates through all of the staff I find its casual upscale vibe very appealing My basis is limited mostly restaurants in Chicago and Boston but this place is my gold standard for restaurant excellence What s amazing is I ve dined here over a handful of times and I remember everything I ve eaten from the rotating seasonal menu except for maybe the desserts I m not much of a dessert guy Notable standouts include olive oil poached halibut over beets the best fish dish I ve ever had pork three ways and grilled octopus with citrus flavors an appetizer I also recommend getting the bone marrow as a side to share The first time I dined here was for brunch with my now fianc We started playing a game to see if our glasses of water would ever go beyond half empty it was a warm summer day They never did Needless to say we left well hydrated and were impressed by the attentive service For brunch I usually look for something with a poached egg and the donut and the hot chocolate containing flavors I ve never experience before are worthy additions My most recent visit here was to try the heralded burger My fianc and I arrived 30 min early on a Saturday to make sure we would be seated at the bar We ended up being the first ones served the burger that night I ordered the burger medium rare with bacon In short the burger is perfect and I wouldn t change a thing It is beyond me how it is so juicy The flavor of the bone marrow that is added to the patty really comes through I really like their house made ketchup conventional ketchup I find too sweet and the potato wedges are a great compliment to the burger My final note is half the times I ve dined here I ve been served by the older gentleman I have to admit I initially thought he was a little brusque I also tend to mispronounce the French terms on the menu which elicited a look from him as if he s saying are you sure you can handle the level of food you will be eating But like any good server he is attentive and politely answers any questions He ends up being the perfect server for enjoying this restaurant In short a terrific restaurant and one that I look forward to each time I visit 
-UtkCv4KUUKzdOJpQitOyg Harvard Had the falafel yesterday and had to agree with my co worker lousy Maybe it s authentic for them to be cold but I ve never had them cold and I m not digging it Even with the yummy harissa and tahini I ll stick with the shawarmas and salads 
-UZoFXFyJw5LDLrVSnJQ_A Harvard Great beer selection Shepherd s Pie was ok actually kinda good after a much more generous dose of salt pepper than I d normally use That s about the only praise I can give this place My brother I sat at the bar and our bartender was pretty terrible Zero personality not at all attentive and actually went so far as to ask us to retrieve some dirty glasses and a plate for him at one point Granted the bar itself was designed poorly in that it s so wide the bartenders weren t able to reach all the way across hence why he asked us to pass him someone else s dishes after they left Ummm sorry his lazy ass still should ve walked around the bar and gotten them himself I saw him repeat this with other bar patrons as well The rest of the bar staff also seemed to be fairly inattentive borderline rude Who knows maybe I caught them on a bad night after some demoralizing staff meeting The service was that lame My brother had the Vegetable Orecchiette pasta It was bland underwhelming I wouldn t go back 
-UzzI4kRN31VjR8t3rpWQw Harvard Rule 1 when going to Border Cafe STAY NORTH OF THE BORDER make sure to tell the host you want to stay upstairs If you don t they will always try and seat you on their basement level which takes quite a bit away from the experience They do a great job with margaritas and serve up quality Tex Mex fair Order on the lighter side as the bottomless chips and salsa will prevent you from finishing a big meal Also to consider if you re driving here is the parking situation it s in the heart of Harvard Square which means you will be hunting for a spot or paying to park in a lot across the street from the restaurant 
-v3Bvkd2tJqcBGyYuWdC-w Harvard The Mac Cheese comes with scallions tomatoes broccoli and extra crumbles of cheese on top making it so much more satisfying than your standard Mac I dig it I also tried the Mexican pizza which had a good crust bread like but not too thick black bean paste jack cheese and chopped tomato salsa it felt like eating real food like you wish you could make for yourself I m not a vegetarian but I didn t miss meat at any point during my meal The location was a bit strange but definitely charming hidden down a flight of stairs at the entrance to the Passim club Dinner seating is tight but in a comfortable kind of way you feel like you re part of the family there distinctly unlike the rush and crowd feel of Bartley s There s four stars only because I m conservative and have to go back again Bike parking is interesting There s a railing just outside where everyone seems to lock up their fixies so that s available if there s room left Yep lots of bikes Otherwise there s a few street signs up the street which might work Either way it s going to be impossible to see your bike from the subterranean locale 
-v6rbdwh_zoYxtGp8rrwwA Harvard Others have written about the exquisite food so I will write instead about the service because my experience was so remarkable on a rainy awful night that I have tears in my eyes thinking about it Having misunderstood an invitation i arrived TWO HOURS early cold wet embarrassed miserable EVERY SINGLE PERSON on the Bondir staff went out of her his way to make me feel comfortable as I sat in the tiny antechamber waiting i had strength only to order an aperitif but they brought me bread and a bowl of hot soup and directed me to a tiny library of cookery books to while away my time They would not let me pay for anything and because I had a patch on one eye and no depth perception they guided me to the bathroom When it was time to leave one server Kathleen came with an umbrella to escort me to a car that was waiting for me If you are old and a bit ditzy and people are unfailingly kind to you you will have an idea of my experience at Bondir I praise not just the gorgeous food and lovely accoutrements but the perfect humanity of the place 
-V7TNA3qwGZT2KRyIE3Htw Harvard The fried fish patty sucks 
-VAX_HmFLHyrPJNdMQTHPw Harvard Meh I was excited with option of wheat tortilla and spicy tofu it wasn t filling My burrito was bland I forgot there was guacamole in it because there wasn t any flavor Can t recommend 
-vie7ZsxWBYZa9dHFRACbQ Harvard This is not Shwarma King The first time I ate here I think I had the lamb which was passable Maybe Tonight I had the beef shwarma which was a pseudo middle eastern version of a deli roast beef with excessively watery tahini For which I was charged 2 extra although there was none in the sandwich None Cold With untoasted pita bread that was falling apart And they asked if I wanted fries with that No I did not want fries with my middle eastern food I would have liked some rice or lentils though On a completely unrelated note they served the Blue Moon with a slice of orange WTF 
-VPqH1L90GlEe4jOPMaIBA Harvard I took my husband here for his birthday last night We did the 10 course tasting which was excellent The waitstaff was wonderful and our server in particular Johnathan was very helpful and informative He made great suggestions for wine and made sure to ask us about our preferences for the tasting The food was excellent and the environment was unpretentious I tasted some foods which I never would have tried and ended up liking everything The most adventurous thing we had was the veal sweetbread I don t typically eat beef but it was prepared very well and it was my husband s favorite dish We were at the restaurant for almost 5 hours but we could have done it in about half the time if we wanted to My suggestion would be to save some money and splurge for one of the tasting menus We did spend a lot of money especially since we got 2 bottles of wine and 2 dessert drinks but it was worth it for a special occasion I would definitely recommend going here for the tasting menu at least once for the experience 
-vpuYqSPvGzb2lAiAgAZaQ Harvard Best burrito place in Harvard Square Everything is great but the chorizo tostada is the hidden gem 
-VqHsNVx0oAe27Dm2uIMGw Harvard Fine by me I can think of bars that are better at all of Charlie s specialties than Charlie s Better burgers at the Burren better beer selection at Bukowski or Cambridge Brewing Company better karaoke at the Asgard etc But Charlie s does well enough at all of those that it s still a good place to go And once you ve made it to Harvard you don t need to be The Best Just good enough at everything you do 
-Vrjs505K6lN7sQYByd75g Harvard update they are no longer offering their happy hour deal 
-VUtQvvjgVdKyfC2eSsYOQ Harvard I think I just experienced the biological sensation of a heterosexual male who is memorized by the site of a luscious curvy hottie Just substitute the latter with Flour s sticky bun On my way to pick up a zipcar I just had to stop and grab this legendary bun I had heard so much about well especially when the Food Network featured it The top was was drenched with the brown sugar cinnamon goo sprinkled with a generous amount of pecans That s the best part of the bun The bottom however reminded me of an old croissant a little dry and hard to cut The texture wasn t that of a Cinnabon nor the taste since the sticky bun was not overly sweetened and carried less of the cinnamon spice it was one of a kind The quiche looked amazing will indeed come back for that 
-W72mjOkFTXsMizjWeemfw Harvard I never see soap in their bathrooms so I m not sure how the staff are washing their hands Enough said Oh yea that staff is nice and the service is good It s always crowded seat wise But yea Methinks not 
-WbLTDS96GS-RUaA_QiBWQ Harvard In short burgers are tasty but the fries suck If you re in a pinch and need a quick bite sure stop in but be warned the fries suck 
-WbpPrJoXtnRIdQ_ZaMIpw Harvard I had an order of 10 sandwiches for an office lunch and they were so helpful and friendly I had a few sandwiches that were specially ordered and every sandwich was made right When I picked up the food everything was ready on time and the sandwiches that were supossed to be cold were cold and the sandwiches that were supossed to be hot were hot Everyone in the office said they were deliscous Will go back again if we have another office luncheon 
-wDfRqM08p49h7-IMoqf7w Harvard I can t believe they are closed I am so sad to hear this Its been forever since I have been in Harvard Square But I was planning on bringing my daughter to the Co Op to visit a friend and immediately thought of grabbing a hot drink here I used to come here when I was waiting for the Bentley Shuttle to show up after spending the weekend at home Or if us girls were going into Boston for a night of clubbing we would swing by for a bit of a caffeine fix They had the best pastries and their drinks were phenomenal If I ever make it over to the North End I will certainly stop by that location 
-WE77EYVYb4-4W6jIBwQ-g Harvard A group of 5 of us when during restaurant week to try out and between us ordered most things off their menu 1 Out of all the appetizers the La Quercia Prosciutto seemed to get the most plaudits I found my tomato soup a little bland 2 The main courses was a mixed bag My catalan stew was terrible and a real disappointment considering it looked such a good choice on the menu It was light on the shrimp and lobster and the clams and mussels didnt seem particularly well prepared The BBQ tenderloin received a better response albeit all of our food seemed a little cold something I had heard from other people too all in all disappointing 3 the desserts were very good I dont think anyone disliked their choice The chocolate creme brulee was original and excellent so were the Pear caramel profiteroles so the dinner ended on a strong note Overall i think that the general consensus was that the meal was just about worth it with restaurant week prices but didnt live up to expectation and definitely not worth the money for their full priced menu Note the menu items are not the same during restaurant week 
-WmrhCTv2mMDcl4WERZjLg Harvard Pizza with a side of pretentiousness Hells yeah OK so in all fairness the food is actually good I mean I wouldn t have thought up potatoes rosemary pizza on my own and I will pat the guy or girl that did on the head and give them a gold star But honestly it is not rocket science that potatoes anything else awesome At least they don t teach it at MIT Our Margherita style pizza was maybe a bit drier and less flavorful than hoped but it wasn t too bad either Probably just paled in comparison to potato pizza I know I did Aside from the initial drink order and the pizza uuuunnnnnveiling that pretentious yes our waitress kind of ignored us though in all fairness the place was kind of busy I think I m dittoing other people when I say it s gourmet pizza and worth a try if you want to deviate from the usual stuff But if you re looking for _pizza_ pizza go for Pinocchios or something 
-wPiv45LQ9MsBchNvhIg4w Harvard Samosas are freaking huge and so yummy I bought 2 meat and 2 spinach and mozarella comes out to 7 55 with tax and could only finish 3 of them took home the last one The dipping sauce that comes with it is great now I see what I am missing out on when I throw away those miniscule containers that come with my take out My friend got the lamb dosa which she loved and which was HUGE i didn t know you could make crepes the size of a tank The mango lassi was also very nice Service is great don t forget to bus over your dishes at the end The dosa factory has a clothing jewelry alcove in the back and groceries up front so there are lots of nooks to explore Bathroom is serviceable but FREEZING You have been warned We will be back Perfect for starving students 
-wq0CBDTRBALekHS5ym_JA Harvard I came here for dinner and dessert with a friend on a week night The staff was very attentive We sat right away and ordered our food The menu is pretty expensive for the portion size but that s just the way this place is quality not quantity The quality of the food here was high in my opinion I had the mac and cheese and it was excellent Rich and warm I was full before I even got dessert but I was obviously not leaving without it I had the layered mousse and it was also very good I felt that the sorbet that came with it was a bit mismatched I would have preferred a raspberry sauce or glaze but the apricot sauce that was there was good The place seems to be set up in a lounge style but they had music playing much too loudly to really feel like a lounge It also loses points because parking in Harvard Square is impossible Just saying if I had the choice between this place and an equivalent with it s own parking lot I d go with the latter Overall I really enjoyed my meal here I m sure I ll be back 
-WQ47F986a6fJ5wdcNk4Pw Harvard Zoes is the best spot in Cambridge Normally that s all I would need to say but since I love it so much I feel compelled to continue The atmosphere prices and large portions make this the ideal diner spot Even though it s always packed I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table including today The service is impressive and the food tastes delicious The place is the best brunch spot in Cambridge easily I went today I had the waffle slammer This hearty meal contains a full waffle bacon sausage eggs and home fries for only 10 Trust me you won t leave with any empty room in your stomach Even more important you ll want to finish the whole meal because it s delicious I could keep writing but you should just experience it for yourself 
-WQuFi-kv71Ek4Jw-I3Oog Harvard Top 5 reasons why the burgers at Firebrand Aint worth 18 1 The Misses waited for 5 minutes she claims 10 but benefiting the doubt at the door without any attention Granted she had her hair in a bun that day I keep warning her about that bun Doesn t do her good 2 I watched my order sit at the pass under the heat lamp for 5 minutes probably more like three minutes but I get some bonus minutes from above before the Chef and owner rolled by to toss some garnish on my food and let it sit their even longer Finally made eyes with the line cook who brought it over Also watched as the raw oysters sat under the heat lamp Front of house despicable 3 The burgers are literally served with NOTHING on the side No side salad that would cost them 30 cents to make No fries No chips Not even a smile 4 Their idea of decor are a few hanging Streetglow kits and a streaming Powerpoint presentation 5 Because you probably worked for that 18 Head the other way to Miracle of Science And the top 3 reasons investors should cut their losses and bail 1 Your chef and owner wanders around aimlessly neither adding any value to the front or back of house while managing to stick his grubby fingers in your food Better make friends with the health inspector 2 Kendall square has about 10 new establishments from Catalyst to Abigails What differentiates Firebrand Aints other than overpriced burgers 3 Your marketing is laughable You could have found a hundred people at MIT to build you a better website overnight for a pack of Red Bull and a mint Darth Vader action figure Wake up and pull the wool off your eyes I love Kendall Square and I want dearly to see it vitalized It s also the exact reason why I want losers like Firebrand Aints to go somewhere else Keep my hard earned 50 I ll be the one laughing when you re all out a mil MIT you could have done better Harvard gets Chef Ferran Adri you get Chef Nobody from Central Kitchen Irate Oh and a note to Bryce the cook chef who tried to make it all better You re better than this You re a young guy with a reputation to build In one year you ll have nothing to show for yourself except tenure at a no name failed establishment in Cambridge 
-wtUBRHkhSjRHs0AAEGPHA Harvard This place is amaaaaaazing Yelp should let me give this place an entire galaxy of stars to rate it I ve been here twice now once for birthday dinner at the bar another time for Sunday brunch at a table like a civilized person and both times were mind blowing The food is seriously the best out there service is impeccable and ambiance is superb The best part You can order anything off any menu and it is guaranteed to be the best that they can give you Tony Maws and his awesome team know their way around a kitchen and this girl s tummy for sure It doesn t hurt that the bartenders know their way around cocktails equally as well Well that part might hurt the next day if you re not careful But knowing you had a fantastic meal should more than make up for it 
-wuFPQCeAqsQKHtZEA2OFA Harvard I ve never ever had good service here but with that said the food isn t bad I don t mind going here when I have time to burn with friends Not the best not the worst The chicken salad is really good if i remember correctly 
-wvA9XDO7sQ6Oa6ED_27BA Harvard Stumbled upon Flour s new location the other day and have been back two days in a row now Their sandwiches are well priced 8 50 and under and oh so tasty My fav is the Grilled Portobello Melt with pesto mozarella and tomatoes YUM The location in Central Square is more spacious than Washington Street I hope for their continued success while hoping it doesn t get more crowded I m someone who guards her food sources Now to try the desserts 
-WVwhT8D1I0J2WN_nQ7h3A Harvard I m fairly neutral on the topic Working in Kendall leaves us limited places to drink after work So often we head here When it s warm out the outdoor tables are the best thing about this place The food is ok the beer is decent the service is a little sad Nothing decidedly awesome or horrid has ever taken place here when I ve been here I ve never had a burning desire to go but I ve never not gone out because we were heading to CBC 
-x1BDKQ7h4Zx2ln2WRkYJQ Harvard Completely blown away by this place It was soooooo good We got there around 3PM on a Sunday and it was still packed and decided to grab the last 2 seats in the bar The place is covered with old school trinkets with lots of the walls are covered with occasionally racy old magazine covers We sat down and the bartender offered us some of a mistake order of their Orleans Fries sweet They do a ton of unique and original takes on traditional items they even have a red bull milkshake Le Petite Monstre An interesting take on the chicken burrito What really makes this monster stand out is the Tabasco cream cheese and the sweet corn salsa Mexican Melt A tasty open faced chicken sandwich with cheddar an avocado lime sauce olives and tomatoes Nachos Fantastic Nachos nuff said Orleans Fries These sweet potato french fries are glazed in a brown sugar Tabasco sauce and come with a sour cream dipping sauce A little taste of heaven 
-X2OJQ5-raOo4BbDzr8PYg Harvard Always crowded that s the only problem So far the potato bacon cranberry pizza is the best on the menu I personally don t like the dough because it gets too hard in their oven 
-Xa7-PGMKaID_yj3wsd5Wg Harvard Yummy And I m referring to the bartenders as well as the food I ve never had a bad meal here and I absolutely love the minimalist simple decor No frills no trend setting It is pretty difficult to wait at the bar for a table because there s very little space You re lucky if you wait less than a half hour on a weekend and are able to maintain a steady hold on your wine glass while people whiz past you The staff is always nice and the malbec is fantastic I also love the open kitchen 
-XAkn0mEubwp_S_ifprfAQ Harvard I went for the burger Amazing It opens at 530PM and we show up at 525PM and there were 7 people in line ahead of us Crazy right Everyone goes straight to the bar area since everyone is there for the same thing Cragie on Main s infamous burger We order that as well as a side of Bone Marrow with fresh bread which I found quite gross but the other guys I was with found it amazing The burger on the other hand was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing I would say it was in my top two or 3 burgers ever with Farmstead in Providence and Kooper s Tavern in Baltimore The bartender and service was also amazing Very attentive and we had amazing liquor drinks made for us I would recommend this place to anyone for a classy burger or a fancy but expensive meal 
-xDlffCuy_-YOpVGIOQrHA Harvard I need to investigate more It smelled delicious in there and I suspect their samdwiches are delicious but I can tell you for now that they won t probably become famous for their espresso Sorry 
-XeDThHKSwi04_W12ZiGTQ Harvard I am truly upset to have to give this great place only three stars but before I divuldge the spoiler of my night I ll tell you all the great things about this restaurant My mother and I plus some family friends went to Harvest by default after realizing the wait at Dali was far too long My mother spent her post college years in Boston and loved Harvest even then They do a wonderful job with fresh simple and delicious flavors One of our dining companions had asparagus soup that was incredible One of my favorite dishes seared scallops were listed and I naturally chose them for my entree Four scallops arrived over a bed of cooked red cabbage and other greens and they were DELICIOUS Others at the table who are hardcore pescatarians agreed my scallops were wonderful and so were their various fish dishes Dessert was wonderful We had a strawberry based shortcake ish thing and a chocolate souffle that really satisfied my constant nagging chocolate craving Now here comes the bad part NEVER ORDER A FANCY COCKTAIL AT HARVEST Or at least not one with bitters compari and kumquat all in one drink What sounded like a delightfully sweet sour citrus y elixir turned out to be none other than cough syrup My mom was joking that they should call it triamenic or dimeatap because at least then they d be truthful and a little more clever about the awful taste Ooof I rarely abandon a cocktail but this one was potentially lethal The food however was so wonderful Order anything on the menu just be careful about being too adventurouson their cocktail menu 
-xeHAuRqWBiIAFrLrjltOA Harvard Our hotel s receptionist sent us here because she has been coming here for 25 years She must have really bad taste glens Their food selection is very small some of the food was not even fresh Their salmon tasted spoiled even after it was cooked Why are they still in business Why do people come here to torture themselves This place is not even sanitary with the way they keep and cook their food 
-xGENBYwKrBb8m7GGjxWgQ Harvard I actually did not realize they had food but man was it a nice surprise Order up a storm of Mediterranean small plates the kabobs and fetta and tomato salad were great Cool staff in a hip spot Very affordable as well J 
-XIRoZbP4UNA7rXBkWdvzA Harvard Loved this place from the Bow and Arrow location to the European setting Inside is claustrophobic to me Absolutely loved the chickpea soup and the iced chocolate Restrooms would be nice as would be friendlier service 
-xj1Ky0S13Q-2G-sr8SNcQ Harvard This is a great place for an Indian food first timer to try The Sunday buffet had a huge variety of choices to choose from Anything with chicken in it was fantastic If you are an Indian Food newbie try one of the shakes They are delicious The service was friendly and fast 
-xNk5LWExYnqNxpmtNQZyw Harvard i came in here one evening already full of delicious libations to meet up with a young gent Located in the middle of Harvard Square twas convenient While dark and rather quiet although it was a Tuesday Noir s got class with its own modification The crowd for lack of a better word there was certainly made of various individuals None of which seemed to be of a certain type which in my opinion was great that there was such differences in one location They do have an open patio which we didn t get to sit on because it was already past the hour However I did get to enjoy sitting in a Frank Sinatra like booth and enjoyed the company I was in over light conversation without overly bearing music blaring or college kids screaming at each other It was nice to not be in the hustle and bustle While enjoying their atmosphere my drink on the other hand could have used a few extra pours but that could again also be the fact that I ve been drinking for awhile and just needed more 
-XPaACOWfC0rGqss2Awxtw Harvard Can t decide between Mexican or Cajun Well then Border Cafe is for you As soon as you sit down the waiter brings you free chips and salsa Yay free But unless you like the salsa on the runny side it s just ok It was spicy too which I like but if you don t you may skip it entirely Now on to the food The boy and I ordered a chilli appetizer to split He ordered the blackened cajun chicken while I ordered the waco chicken which I was tempted to pronounce as whacko The chilli was fine Made with black beans instead of kidney beans Nothing special about it but it was fine I didn t try the blackened cajun but the boy had this look on his face that said he ll eat it but he doesn t exactly love it My waco chicken was pretty good not fabulous good but it had cheese so it couldn t be bad Though I really don t understand what a piece of cornbread was doing on my Mexican dish It just didn t make sense All in all the food was very generic tasting It wasn t bad It just wasn t great either The service was excellent though And from having come here prior to this just for drinks well those are outstanding too Just don t come here expecting top notch Mexican Or Cajun 
-XqGOKFySbBGFbnsIbryOA Harvard Cafe Luna just became my favorite Sunday Brunch Spot I decided to drop by last Sunday to check the place out One of the nicest things is that the staff go out of their way to be friendly and helpful especially the owner Matt Everything I tried was just superb The Mocha was creamy and very chocolatey one of the best I ve had It must be their combination of dark chocolate syrup good quality chocolate powder I had a sniff and espresso Seeing the Lobster Benedict on the menu I told them that what I would like however was Lobster in an omelette The nice girl at the counter said sure she thinks that s possible and would check with the kitchen They obliged and I had a scrumptious custom order of Lobster omelette with asparagus Although somewhat full I was keen on trying the French Toast stuffed with fresh fruits and custard cream Guess what They do half orders So I had a delicious half order of stuffed French Toast which was still sizable and required some effort to put away I was only sad that I could not listen to the Jazz ensemble as I had to head out around the time they came in which is about 2 30 3 00pm Well next time The prices were reasonable too I highly recommend it The daughter of Hyperion and Theia would be pleased 
-XrUbNjArHchvasjZ-YRJw Harvard Just OK not great I really wanted to love this place due to the close proximity to my apartment as opposed to Moody s I love the falafels at Moody s but frankly the one disgruntled worker they have is quite moody himself and always seems to be on his period Thus I figured I would try out Wrapro for my falafel needs First gripe these falafels are not made fresh They also close super early at 9PM on weekdays When I went in at 8 o clock on a Tuesday they had about 100 prepared falafels sitting around I am guessing that they were not going to sell 100 falafels in an hour since I was the only one there It would not kill them to make fresh falafels to keep up with demand and cut down on waste Next gripe the falafels inside the falafel sandwich were cold It is one thing if you choose to serve pre made falafels but at least heat those babies up for me you bastids In addition the falafels were a little spongy on the inside due to being prepared earlier and sitting around Adding to my frustrations the sandwich was poorly wrapped and ruptured as soon as I liberated it from its paper wrapping I still inhaled that ish anyway but they need to improve their wrapping skills if they are going to refer to themselves as WraPRO Despite these gripes the staff was very friendly and the establishment was spotless I was a dollar short for my order and when I offered to get the difference from my car the woman behind the counter said don t worry about it I thought that was very nice The baba ghannouj I ordered on the side was well prepared and very tasty If it weren t for that I would totally give this place 2 stars I will be back albeit I will probably not be sober These falafels are good drunk eats when you don t really care about quality and are just looking for sustenance Moody s bitchy worker definitely makes a finer falafel than the guys at Wrapro 
-XRUq_3WIUihQ8Ygfit5Vw Harvard Not too long ago there was an article or was it a review that I enjoyed reading that named a certain establishment as the author s local defining local as a pub near one s home where you can stumble from drunk a place where they know you Because you are there A lot This undoubtedly makes Russell House Tavern my local And for that I am thankful I ve stumbled in stumbled out tried nearly everything on the menu sipped wine from the tap beer from the bottle knocked back more Fernet than I should admit met up with friends ran into some more sat at the upstairs bar with the windows open sat downstairs in the lounge and even brunched on the patio It s just one of those places where you can do all of those things and they are all so well done Points that separate Russell House from the pack The editing process of their bar for starters There s hardly anything more exciting than the opportunity to be introduced to a new beer wine spirit of which I was previously unfamiliar Nope you just won t find the same old selection here And if that s what you re looking for then there s plenty of other bars to hit up in Boston If you re curious ask about their wine on tap their extensive craft beer selection or their scotch list For lunch dinner brunch or late night snacks the Russell House menu features dishes in a wide range of proteins flavors and price points You ll find pizzas are big enough to share while small plates are perfectly sized to enjoy 2 3 per person Traditional entrees range from 10 28 and you d be a fool not to find something to love lamb shank an Ozark pork trio belly shoulder and loin two steaks and a really bad ass burger served on an English muffin The fries with their crispy salty perfection of texture make it hard for me to eat them any where else Among my favorites the egg the charcuterie and the pork trio Whether at the bar or a table I ve found the service to be pretty on point with the food generally arriving in the right amount of time the staff smiling and helpful and water glasses shot glasses beer glasses and cocktails are always full And despite the busy summer season getting a seat here is a relatively smooth and swift process The only night I absolutely couldn t get a table was during Harvard graduation Fair enough A melding of creative well priced food a welcoming and warm atmosphere the decor improvements from the previous inhabitant are tremendous finely crafted cocktails and a beer and wine list that will both educate and satisfy you Russell House is the piece that s been missing from Harvard Square a bar lounge restaurant that lacks pretension caters to the curious with being too obscure and never fails to make for me a difficult time of narrowing down just what exactly I am going to eat and drink each time I go 
-XRymI8KvwqhX6R_uzRsqQ Harvard We were blessed with gorgeous Boston weather for our al fresco lunch at Upstairs On the Square Everything on the menu seemed to call out to me but I absolutely could not get enough of the simple bibb lettuce with radishes grapefruit and green goddess dressing I ate every single bite of that refreshing pile o greens I rarely finish full portions of anything Regrettably after my grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup there was no room for dessert This was especially sad given how tantalizing the seasonal selection of sorbet appeared 
-XuBi9OJC48ujfLhat_2Fw Harvard Everything was pretty swell Our service was great There was a nice assortment of strange Cantabrigians There was an adorable asian couple that looked like they were eating lobster for the first time They were having so much trouble As a native New Englander I wanted so badly to go over there and crack it up for them but that would have been super rude Anyway on to the food We got an assortment of shellfish apps The crab cakes were fluffy and flavorful Our oysters were the usual sweet briny good The clams casino were warm and toasty with delicious buttery breadcrumbs We paired all of this with two delicious glasses of Verdejo which was awesome for the price and I almost wish we had time for a bottle The only part of our meal that was a disappointment were the steamed clams The flavor was spot on and you could tell they had the appropriate amount of freshness And with clams you expect a certain amount of gritty sand but nearly every clam was full of not just sand but full on molar cracking pebbles And it wasn t as simple as dipping them in the broth a few times We had to clean each clam out by hand carefully removing large chunks of rock out of their squishy insides If the clams had been soaked ahead of time in cold water for 20 to 30 minutes they would have spit out all this grit Perhaps they were soaked but certainly not long enough Despite their deliciousness I ll probably not get them again Dental work costs a lot more than dinner 
-xVLf5XyMN4sOuMIRdR5mw Harvard Love it Love it Love it The health food the tasty veggie pizza the great beer the fantastic waitress My fiance and I had several great memories and conversations there The food is large portion and price is very affordable 
-xx74FnBn2XEle7WvKfZjQ Harvard Awesome place When you walk in it almost looks more like they cast their customers instead of people walking in randomly Very cool crowd the prices are dirt cheap 8 9 a plate The food was very good and the staff is super friendly Only down side the bacon tasted like a mixture of throw up and dirt No lo recomiendo I got eggs Benedict one of the things I miss the most since being a vegetarian wanna be vegan It was very satisfying I don t know if meat eaters would be able to compare it to real eggs but if you have an open mind this thing tasted pretty good Somebody I was with had a really long hair in their food and the employee immediately took it away and offered a new one Without having even asked when she brought the check it was removed from our bill She was very nice the entire time and the service was pretty fast for it being super packed in there We probably waiter about 20 minutes This place was awesome is all I can say maybe its called veggie galaxy because they really are aliens conspiracy theory maybe but really I didn t think humans could still be so competent and friendly at the same time 
-xySNkFsyWXNH7fcx08oeQ Harvard Food is okay but pretty much just like any other Thai place Nothing is very outstanding but it has typically been pretty consistent I guess consistently average isn t too bad The curries I ve eaten have been fine but not particularly tasty I do find it weird to walk downstairs to eat in a subterranean place I ve never sat by a window but I think it must be weird to see people s feet as you walk by 
-XzqGDL-XFKaqe9XWDt4Iw Harvard In my drunken state i was still able to take some photos of my food http www yelp com biz_photos YeRXjIzxc9FaK6uyrTBvkQ select s9UMVV bYgB0jkleURRQmQ i guess yelp brainwashed me that much huh Falafel a little dry but overall it wasn t too bad There wasn t anything particularly memorably about the food here but it all hit the spot Had a little bit of EVERYTHING baba ganoush grape leaves salad falafel lamb or chicken shwarma pita tahini and hummus so if you wanna get a little nibble of everything get the super combo 
-XZrE77sCMkqN5XMgBrbSQ Harvard i like bertucci s i dont get to eat here as often as i d like because the bf is a snobby european variety who thinks real pizza is the kind originating in italy on the other hand i was reared in a southern californian suburb and delighted in pizza hut and dominoes growing up so i am more than happy with bertuccis i especially like their spicy shrimp one actually i dont think ive ever had a pizza i didnt like there the bread rolls are good too 
-y4zmlhE_lEZgBQJ0-_Dzg Harvard Worst brunch experience ever The service is non existent Slow and careless The staff actually avoids eye contact to prevent you from asking something The waitress didn t even let me finish my order before walking away After that I had to serve myself from the counter for basically everything except that soon cups water and spoons were gone so I basically had to pick up dirty ones and rinse them myself The coffee is bad and carelessly prepared Towards the end of the meal I was briefly blessed with the attention of the owner who got the girl to remake my cappuccino She took three attempts and still couldn t make me one that wasn t a bathtub full of milk with one espresso shot The food is ok but definitely not worth waiting an hour for in those conditions Unless you take the situation in stride and laugh off the ridiculous service as a comic skit 
-yhH61l0S5L3yQe6Xptu0A Harvard If you are going to go high end dining and want presentation more than being completely stuffed with food this fits the bill We had a large group for a birthday party so we worked with the planners in advance It narrows your choices down but honestly that isn t a bad thing They were very accommodating we had a screened off place to the side of the entrance and our own staff so service was pretty good Let s just say no one s wine glass stayed empty for long There is no wifi through the restaurant but you can use the Harvard University guest access if you truly need to check Facebook during the evening The appetizer portions seemed a little on the small side but that s because the Jonah Crab salad was magnificent and I wanted more A lot of flavor in that little salad I had the top sirloin and it was cooked perfectly again tons of flavor The potato puree was a bit on the salty side but mixing it in with my bites of sirloin helped The sirloin portion was a decent size but the potatoes and vegetables were lacking a bit Dessert was a tort which I had to give the rest to my husband because it was just a little too rich for me He was also still hungry his cheesecake was much smaller sized than my tort All in all it was a wonderful dining experience and more importantly the birthday girl was happy 
-YhvdlQwMktmMwFAyUZv5w Harvard After a fun filled night of karoke near BU we wanted to cruise back over to Harvard for a night cap Since we are Virginians the cold got the best of us and we agreed to go to the first bar that we saw We spotted Russell House across the street and noticed on their sign that they have 1 oysters from 11 midnight yes 11 12 pm The whisky and beer selection was extensive and descently priced I ordered the Belgian Abbey Ale beware this is a heavy one but full bodied and 9 4 We also ordered 2 dozen oysters They came from somewhere on the west coast so they were small but tasted good It was a bit of a teaser you can t win em all To top it off our waitress Karen was super nice and helpful Thanks Russell House for a good time 
-yL-d1RpIVDhlF2MoiHdrA Harvard I had lived in Kendall Square for over 5 years patiently awaiting for a hotspot a bar a restaurant for anything to open This was 2 years ago and since then many spots have open making that neighborhood a new hotspot Area Four was amongst the first few to open and I could hardly contain my excitement as I went there for the first time Since my first visit I ve been a few times to get a quick coffee or for a drink I ve even been for dinner The neat thing about Area Four is the space which has three very distinctive areas the cafe the bar and the restaurant Each is separated by walls has it s own staff and seems to operate independently from the others Having been to all three I can honestly say that it somehow works and that the concept is neat I m surprised that no establishment has really tried that concept before in the Boston area This enables them to adapt to the time of day and crowd The cafe is open for breakfast and for lunch through some of the afternoon but shut downs in late afternoon in order to focus on the cocktail and beer drinking dinner eating crowd I ve had a few sandwiches from the cafe for lunch and each was pretty tasty although they were made in advance instead of to order While there was nothing wrong with them there also wasn t anything special about them either My visit to the bar was pleasant and they have a decent selection of beer and spirits but again nothing too special The cocktails were decent but far from impressive What really shined there though and what has made me come back was my meal there I ve had a few dishes there and each was pretty well fulfilled and affordable as well They have this giant oven that they use much like Posto in Somerville does to cook up and finish off some of their dishes and they utilize it well in the menu s execution I ve had their baba ganouj appetizer which came with some za atar and house made pita 5 which I found to be tasty and a great affordable way to start a meal Great for sharing as well The presentation is neat as well as it comes served in a small cast iron dish I ve also had their chicken salad with arugula and tomatoes which came to around 11 if I can recall correctly it is no longer listed on their site and I ve also had a bite of a few of their pizzas including the margherita and the caramelized onion and gorgonzola one While the pizzas are good and decently priced I didn t find them to be incredible Posto has much better ones in my opinion That being said they are still good as was the rest of the food there One thing that I have not done is get brunch there I need to at some point their menu seems interesting and exciting enough From bagels to breakfast sandwiches and even pastries which are baked daily at their cafe All in all the place is solid and the staff friendly and adaptable they were even able to whip up an Arnold Palmer per my request and it was delish The decor is very modern sleek and some of the tables will force you to bump elbows with strangers which isn t bad and a bit fun But you could also get a regular table there although I d recommend you make a reservation if possible because the place does get packed 
-YQ6OQK6BMOxkvLWli5uiw Harvard Grendel s Den has the benefit of being in a stellar location They re this cozy little pub smack dab in the middle of bustling Harvard Square They also get extra points for having such a funny silly name Other than that I don t really have any reason to ever return to the bowels of Grendel s Den While I can t recall all that much from my first trip to Grendel s my second trip certainly left a lasting impression We managed to snag patio seating for four on perhaps the nicest day of the year yet My friend and I ordered a margarita and a pisco sour both of which turned out to be okay He hated the pisco I guess but it wasn t altogether terrible The food was what really soured the experience I ordered the Sonoma Wrap sun dried tomato goat cheese turkey guac etc which honestly tasted like a combination sour cream dirt sweat and cardboard I couldn t even finish half of it One of my friends ordered the Beggar s Banquet a MASSIVE amount of food for 12 which included Spinach Pie Pasta rice pilaf Hummus Tahini Grilled Chicken breast and maybe even something else He was incredibly disappointed The chicken was burnt dry and flavorless and the hummus was soupy and sour My roommate ordered Tofu Quinoa and was dismayed to discover that the only distinguishing ingredient in the stew besides the obvious was celery In short one of the worst meals any of us have paid for in recent memory 
-ysgV1Pe9PW4drqVa9kzgw Harvard This should really be a police report and a health board complaint on the Chef Owner of this restaurant So I was here last night and I NEVER write negative reviews but this was so beyond what I have ever experienced that I was compelled to post this I sent this review to Living Social so they are aware of the businesses that they are associated with This was by far my most awful restaurant experience The crazy owner in dirty and ripped clothes stumbles in drunk or on drugs during my mid meal deep frying raw meat in a vat of oil with is in itself disgusting going to different tables to show everyone a heavily bandaged cut finger Exclaiming that he was hurt he made the mistake of grabbing someone at my table from the back and was told not to touch him We were a little shocked at the invasion of personal space and thought he was some homeless man that they let in The owner as he proclaimed loudly to be then proceeds to sit diagonally behind us and making a scene which caused us and everyone else to be very uncomfortable The he made some small racial comment WHAT kind of level of professionalism is that WHAT kind of business owner parades a cut bandaged finger in the at a food establishment when everyone was eating And did he cut it and handle the raw food that we were all eating Is there some kind of health code that this violates This guy kept harassing the table even though we ignored him and said how we were NOT nice to him when in fact he was the one at fault by grabbing someone at the table and showing us his finger at a food establishment I feel like he wanted attention and to be coddled for his wound and was a pissy little child when he was told not to touch anyone It was gross and unappetizing The behavior freaked everyone out His lady friend that he sat with came over to apologize for his behavior and said he is off his rockers tonight and for us not to judge this establishment by the way he is acting This owner then proceeds to antagonize the table further for no reason as we had already let this situation go and was trying to enjoy the rest of the meal He essentially forced us to leave by sitting behind us making comments and harassing the table Everyone dining there was silent We asked for the bill tipped on the full meal because this was not the waitress s fault and didn t even want the dessert that we had purchased with the voucher As I walked passed him he was still making a scene so I told him thanks for the experience and he retorts I really don t give a sh t and proceeded to stand up to further escalate things What kind of man would stand up and attempt to intimidate a girl We took the higher road and left I went home and Yelped this place and apparently this owner does this a lot If Had we not walked away there would have been a fight We gave him the courtesy and respected the other patrons of this place so we did not make a scene I still feel ill at this experience and how threatening this owner was to us Everyone should be aware of this guy this kind of neighborhood business should not be supported 
-YsT0nBqilLn_GQQSPkdew Harvard For New American fare they remind me a lot of Les Quinze Nits and 4 Gats in Barcelona The food is excellent but the decor is not as appealing It would be nice if they provided different seating zones for those who prefer a less ornate environment Though I recommend the dining experience 
-yZcVEA-i73ZkDdQwZMrsA Harvard Have been here many times with different groups on a date girls night out visiting family and it has always been a hit The zen atmosphere is perfectly calming The food is incredible filling and flavorful but not heavy or overwhelming Tibetan food is like a healthy subtle blend of Indian and Chinese Great vegetarian options and wonderful dumplings The wait staff is polite but very quiet Only downside is that they don t take reservations 
-Y_nxAxdOt_KAUIISSCvbA Harvard The pizza was pretty good but the atmosphere is pretty lame and so is the service and time it takes to get the food even when it s not busy I m definitely puzzled by the relatively high ratings here 
-Z-eu0KIXOO5BK22dZPHLw Harvard Not bad Quick reliable cheap 
-z2eS5WXL9aXOL8SC0P53A Harvard I had an amazing time here during the yelp office hours and have been meaning to try it ever since it opened Their food and drinks were extremely good especially for a coffee shop and everything is made in house I especially enjoyed the apple scones light and fluffy macaroons grilled chicken sandwich and the red nectar drink The sweet potato sandwich also looked appetizing There are plugs everywhere so you ll never have to search for a place to plug in your computer The tables are a little small to spread out if there are two people but perfect for one I love the open feel and how the front opens completely My only complaint is that the sandwiches are a little small for the price you pay but the flavor combinations are great Another thing that I don t understand is why Crema closes at 8 pm I feel like it s a little too early but then again everything in Harvard closes early Bathrooms Two downstairs unisex and clean 
-ZAAnxhZ9r25bfwYhw5vwg Harvard The goal of a great restaurant is not just to provide great food but a great experience as well Cuchi Cuchi does both and hence is a great restaurant in my opinion When I walked in I was charmed by the lavish outfits the attractive staff wear Hats feathers neck ties Very cool I began with a drink at the bar a Pegu Club Absolutely perfect The drink list reflects old classics from history that have been resurrected Pegu Club was apparently a favorite of the Brits in Rangoon circa 1920s The Food my reviews only apply to vegetarian food We ordered a fried tomato dish a fried artichoke dish and the gratin daphinois Everything was delicious well prepared and generous in portion 
-zaDVTu_wq5M56gdZlr4vg Harvard The drinks are amazing old school drink menu tons of options Free hard boiled eggs at the bar Friendly and nice waiters and bar staff Excellent food Simple basic American style food Roasted chicken the salad with candied walnuts pears and blue cheese could be the only salad I eat for the rest of my life and I d die happy It s my favorite for dinner or drinks and I wish I could go more often 
-ZajnKvJUWmM1LaTDVJr4w Harvard One of my favorite places for coffee in the morning and certainly some of the best food in Cambridge Coffee They have sugar syrup which is key for iced coffee unless you enjoy choking on a gritty granulated slurry cough cough dunkin I don t eat much in the morning but the bakery stuff looks super tasty The people who work the coffee are friendly and not moody which I appreciate in the morning Dinner Homemade pretzel nuggets fried in bacon fat with pimento cheese dip YES SIR Solid salads and great entrees Portions aren t huge and the prices are about 5 per item more than I d like to spend Dessert Olive oil chocolate cake is stupid good Honey panna cotta is the best thing I ve tried Don t skip desert or you will be crowned king idiot 
-ZE6yXhci82Jwem0xPjLtQ Harvard I love this place I ve lived here in Somerville over a year and have only ever had delivery Many times I am so impressed with their pizza I think it is my favorite I ve had in Boston Its real cheese that actually strings when you take a bite Also the cashier phone person and delivery drivers are ALWAYS friendly I also get exactly what I order everytime ranch on the side and a diet coke I ve also never had to wait longer then a half hour for an order And the fact that they have froyo is just such an added bonus I will always stay loyal The eggplant topping is my favorite 
-zJ87cyNFpVOLiXCzOn5ZA Harvard don t eat here go to shows here it s a great venue that brings in good bands but do not eat here one of the worst bar restaurant experiences i ve ever had were 2 consecutive weekends at the upstairs restaurant back in october the first weekend i was with my boyfriend and one of his friends and girlfriend we came in around 10 i think and grabbed a table we were planning on having drinks and possibly an appetizer or two the waitress who i will always remember what she looks like because she was so awful and if you ever have the kind of boyish fat girl with glasses waiting on you there you ve got her too she drops some menus on the table and asks us if we re eating we said maybe but we weren t sure she tells us that we have to get out of her table that it s still the dinner rush and she won t wait on us so we start to walk out the door saying how ridiculous and totally not allowed that kind of treatment of customers is she chases us out the door and begs us to come sit at her table that she was wrong and doesn t want to get in trouble we sit down have about 4 rounds and yes we did end up having appetizers and although i wouldn t have if it were up to me but my boyfriend was paying tipping a full 20 oh and at one point she just slapped the check down on our table a good hour and a half before ast call when no one had asked for it apparently she was sick of us she was overall pretty rude and not a very good waitress the following weekend i had a friend visiting from new york and she wanted to go to middle east to drink as we went in we saw that the same waitress was working but so was another one so we hoped we d get the other waitress but no such luck she immediately haves an attitude with us throws some menus and takes our drink order we actually wanted to have a meal there too and when we tried to order she tells us that they ve stopped serving food for the night but as we drink we notice her bringing plates out to other tables even long after we first got there she is rude an awful and as of the last time i was there still working avoid her 
-ZlI5EiAE3BFz8FyhpZcDA Harvard Delicious food and great service I can t tell what kind of atmosphere this is though formal classy casual I saw people wearing all different kinds of clothes from super casual to date night formal Either way I don t think they care This was my 2nd time trying this type of New American food Sometimes the actual food and the ingredients don t really sound good to me but once everything is all together the flavors blend SO WELL It s like a party in my mouth of delicious spices and ingredients that I never would have liked if I ate them by myself And I actually didn t like them individually when I picked apart the salads and side dishes All their tables are copper or copper esque material It s a pretty small restaurant and they have a decently sized bar There are no house lights but since we were there when the sun was still out the lighting wasn t too bad I d imagine it being pretty dark though if it was night outside First off their white bean spread for their complimentary rustic bread is very unique and yummy It s not as thick as hummus but it kinda seems like white bean blended with yogurt or something I just hope it didn t have loads of butter cause otherwise I would ve definitely had clogged arteries after how much of that I ate Wild mushroom pate Looks a little weird like spreaded white mush but combined with the bread and pickled mushrooms and salad YUM Filet mignon tartare not my cup of tea but my brother loves this stuff They put a lot of onions and spices in the tartare and an optional quail egg on top I only enjoyed it with the bread because it was too much for me alone Sardine special this was probably my favorite I ve never seen sardines so big and tasted so flavorful It was slightly charred on the outside which gave it a good crisp Monkfish Etouffe pretty spicy so don t get this if you can t handle I liked the consistency of the grilled monkfish but it was underseasoned so you had to eat it with the sauce Pretty good overall though 
-ZM-UC303_LiBGVfa9aB3w Harvard I actually think this place could be kind of good But it s less than average I don t know if the menu changes during lunch or what but I went there for dinner with my friend and we were well surprised disappointed with the 1 page food menu and 5 pages of drinks and to add to that the food menu was really expensive for a place that looks like an old diner off the side of the road 13 for a chicken BLT 20 25 for entrees that didnt even look that good The music isn t as loud as everyone says but it could have been a good night when we were there I like the colors and the deco feel to it and the layout and the waitstaff is friendly The menu needs to be changed Until then I probably won t go back there 
-ZQbsLJ6bI7vt_YtHmZLQg Harvard Anna s is the definition of you get what you pay for You don t pay much but don t expect too much in terms of quality The sizes are pretty decent but the taste is pretty bland The location is great it s right in the MIT Student Center and is by far the best option in there Anna s is so cheap if your in the area and are looking to eat on a budget Anna s is a great place to go but if you have the money and the time to go somewhere else by all means 
-zU2_gvUE_IQ0AC8B32Exg Harvard I like Arrow The food is very fresh healthy They not only have the best crepes of Cambridge but also tasty soups and salads Try the smoked salmon crepe However it is really get seated if you have a party of more than 4 people and it is usually very busy at the weekends Pick a weekday get together a small party and try it 
-zvRrQscnTzfs4eRZShqsA Harvard Went with a friend to 9 Tastes tonight because of the number of strong reviews it has received from Yelp and was very disappointed She ordered the Eggplant entree which had 1 spice icon next to it and I had the Basil Leaf w Tofu entree 2 spice icons The food was bland and our entrees had the same basic ingredients except hers had Chili in there which was way too spicy for someone who didn t want a spicy dish and mine did not The fried tofu in my dish ranged from small tiny dried up cubes to medium sized dried up cubes did not capture the flavor of the sauce well Also for a 2 spicy icon dish wasn t spicy at all Compared to other Thai places in the area NYC Thailand LA this definitely does not match up Maybe this was a bad night and 9 Tastes deserves its positive rating or maybe it s on JFK and more likely to be positively rated either way i m not going back PS and they charge for tea 
-ZwZVNzALChhDTuNmSFbmw Harvard 25 cent wings cant complain Honey barbecue were delicious buffalo were typical always good and gold fever were fine amazing atmosphere though even on a Monday night Great and inexpensive way to have a casual night out 
-_3rLPHw25HUmgQjcS9LEA Harvard Wow what a small cramped space but my favorite place to eat for a weekend brunch The salty and sweet crepes are so tasty and cheap Don t go with more than 3 people though you probably won t fit through the door The small place has huge windows though of harvard yard LOVE it check it out 
-_anQt4beVDv_bELU69VLg Harvard They have oysters and their bar manager is Aaron formerly of Drink Try his housemade spiced rum And a great beer list what more could you ask for I haven t tried any of their food so can t comment on that Go at off hours like 2pm 
-_aZPa_loeijR82b6BFb4Q Harvard We came here for my mother s birthday a few weeks ago Dad easily got reservations for dinner on a Tuesday but seeing how busy it was when we arrived I m glad he got them I love how everything is actually local as in you can see exactly where they got each piece of the menu Locavores and lovers of fine cuisine will be thrilled Started out with butternut squash soup with ancho chili oil maple butter and toasted pumpkin seeds Wow The chilies added just enough bite to keep me interested The soup was creamy but not too heavy I dipped some bread Iggy s into it which was heaven I got the bluefish entree and it was divine It had been a long time since I d eaten bluefish but it was perfectly cooked served over roasted peppers and other veggies it was meant to come with a pear relish or something like that but I m not a pear fan so I asked for no pear We rounded out the evening with dessert parsnip cake did not try and flourless chocolate cake I wish my cake had more raspberry sauce and less whipped cream but the chocolate part was divine The service was impeccable Our waitress was patient with our lagging in order Dad likes to take his time and our accidental Tuesday night tipsiness She knew the menu and was attentive but not overbearing Glad I tried EVOO I work in Kendall so next on the list is definitely Za 
-_Ep0R2t29juE5TFU6o4xA Harvard As a Harvard student I m not sure if I d survive without Noch s I always get the artichoke pizza and a bottle of root beer under 5 Can t go wrong with that I have tried other slices and the sausage comes in second for me It s open until 2 which is a 10 Come marvel at all the drunk kids The seating is EXTREMELY limited so be prepared to feel snug or take it outside Although the park across the street is creepy and dirty Please don t go there ALSO they only accept cards if it s over 7 aka 2 slices and a drink 
-_FXynRoIbrWGWNwynOjAw Harvard Not going to say I m wild about this place For a basement they do alright but even the fireplace can t save it There are places better for ambiance and better for pub grub 
-_iiQF3EV7qi2zWYjYL7Og Harvard This is my new favorite hole in the wall within walking distance serving mixed Asian cusine in Cambridge Okay a lot of qualifiers but still shouldn t be discounted Sushi is fresh the chow mein too salty but also too yummy The egg plant in garlic sauce is delicious The place is a little bit ghetto fabulous minus the fabulous and the staff is bit FOB but super super nice I wanted a little white rice with my left over eggplant and they sent me home with a small heaping no extra charge That s very un asian usually asian cafe are staffed with really unfriendly people That uncharacteristic behavior combined with the yummy goodness makes me want to go back again for lunch tomorrow eventhough I just had dinner there today May be I ll even go back for dinner again Thumb s up the number of which is in debate but the key thing is that it s up Try it 
-_NwWZ8EyHNRaTYo4J6ayQ Harvard Oh the late nights I ve spent at Noir My one complaint about Noir is they ve usually long stopped serving food by the time I show up in the wee hours They re open till 2 they ve got a good bourbon selection the cocktails are excellent and Alice will give you a great neck massage if you ask nicely and sometimes even if you don t The patio s fantastic in the summer and hell in the spring and fall too When you see all the neighborhood bartenders show up at the same place when their shifts are done you know you ve chosen the right bar 
-_rfCRR2CQjon3M4MS5Ylw Harvard Looooove The inside of this place was so unexpected given the location And it was surprisingly easy to get a table on a weekday at lunchtime The food was fast reasonably priced and reasonably tasty I enjoyed the special cucumber salad and my mini carrot cake I regret getting the pomegranate icee Something was off it was such a pretty color but tasted a bit too strong I even had to take a phone call I know rude and could actually hear the other callers If I lived closer I would definitely head over with a book and settle in to nibble on pastry drink tea and subtlely eavesdrop on all the stylish patrons 
-_SMCbridl-mGumUNn0jgw Harvard I think it took me 6 years before I started visiting this place regularly I was prompted to find Noir when I was searching for a place to take an exboyfriend for one of those awkward state of my life without you conversations that we hadn t visited during the relationship Plus it s dark there which gave the meeting a stealthy vibe Anyway since then I ve been back to Noir a ton I never knew about the happy hour menu All the sandwiches are 4 dollars instead of 8 and you can get a big warm cookie for a dollar And a wasabi pea mix for only a few bucks My favorite time to visit Noir is in the summer when one can feel all Euro by sitting on the patio No one has to know you only paid 6 dollars for your meal Of course drinks are not on sale but a place that will feed me and provide a full cocktail for 20 bucks has got my stars Finally the waitstaff is incredibly friendly The gregarious bartender always lets me sit where I want and she even sneaks me the happy hour menu even when I show up just moments before 9pm Happy hour ends at 9 and I believe it begins at 6 Good music too I ve heard the Cure there ps They showed Madmen on Sunday nights last summer on the large projector One time the projector didn t work which was frustrating but then we got a free round Good times 
-__j3RbuuqMiiiU-SRRO_g Harvard Hey I m going to be in town can you recommend any good restaurants Do you like southern food I guess I was thinking something a little nicer Can you get to Kendall Square Sure Order the No 43 Don t forget the cornbread and grits 
0-dzwBivuF3qwvV9zUcqCg Harvard OMG people beware If I could give this place 5 stars I would Beware the name people it s very clear I went here because I was out and about and needed food quick and this was the first place on the map being disoriented by the sun it seems I did not make sense of the name So I went in sat down with my SO and he ordered some egg drop soup and some saus chicken with broccoli The egg drop soup was super oily when is egg drop soup 99 oil it tasted so nasty I almost barfed the acid in my stomach on the table the chicken smelled odd like when you leave it in the fridge and you know you re hungry it s almost about to go bad but you risk food poisoning cause you re broke and you cook it That type of chicken I munched on some oily egg rolls and got a stomach ache afterwards Food poisoning at its best people needless to say I m running away from Pu Pu Hot Pot because I made exactly what it s called in my toilet bowl

0-foKQEkOHzY8a8f5qcjLQ Harvard I never found myself really craving burgers until I came here with a friend now Uburger is now my number one all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onion on a non sesame seed bun destination in Boston Even the plain hamburger is full of flavor and moist like the ideal backyard grill burger Customization options are pretty much endless Prices seem high if you re comparing them to McDonald s or Burger King but in the context of other Boston sandwich shops they re right in line Besides which if you re in the mood for a really great hamburger and you run across the street to McDonald s just to save a few bucks you re abusing your tastebuds and the state WILL come and take them away until you learn to be a better caretaker My only real complaint is the forgettable fries crispy and fresh but no real flavor If you re doing takeout this is where the the trip to McDonald s is perfectly justifiable Uburger does have a pretty nice dining area boasting a bigscreen TV but its proximity to BU and Fenway could see it fill up fast 
0-kpbd3KXLijixyDUnNnQQ Harvard Oh No Emma s is not THAT good There is a strange thing going on with the pizza here sure its way better than the average student ghar bahge in Cambridge but does it really earn its and stars I m sure that a better place wouldn t use sugar in their caramalized onions but I m sure they do which is a bad distractor from the pizza The italian sausage pizza was a bland experience With the sweet caramalized onions saying nyah nyah you paid alot for this The pizza should be absolutely top notch here and it sometimes is but often is not For those prices that s not enough Dehydrated garlic in the spinach salad is NOT funny You shouldn t do that to us you know no way The service staff try to be nice but are clearly burned out disdainful of most customer or thinking about their art project that you as customer are interfering with I think they mean well I ll give them one more try but Mr Emma get the QA department involved soon 
0-To5HYphUjGUOtJr6PK8w Harvard Spent my birthday here because the menu is huge and sure to please a group I did enjoy the dolled up staff and the kooky decor However despite what the website says it s more than just 5 minutes from the T and the menu has a 20 minimum per person at the tables so plan on indulging My disappointing drink was my own fault Word to the wise don t try bourbon for the first time in a 10 dollar cocktail just because the name is Sugar Daddy from Miami Still I appreciate their creativity and hope to come back for a simple fruity martini 
0-V2dbAznyB2IqT6TRWB0g Harvard I went to Daedalus for dinner with a few friends on a Wednesday night Boston was having unseasonably warm weather so we picked this placed because of it s roof deck The menu also sounded delicious but I have to say I was really disappointed with my meal I ordered the pork tenderloin which is supposed to come with mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans Instead I received a cafeteria esque meal of small pork medallions absolutely SMOTHERED in gravy your most basic mashed potatoes and baby carrots instead of green beans which I am not a fan of I wish the waiter had informed me of this substitution because I would have changed my entire order The meal was OK but nothing special Like I said akin to cafeteria food My friend also ordered bruschetta as an appetizer for the 3 of us It came as 2 thick french bread style slices which I had to cut up to split between the 3 of us Not what I expected at all and definitely not worth the price Overall this place is way overpriced for what you get or at least what I got My friends both got sandwiches since they were cheaper and they look delicious and on price point Nice roof deck though 
-0VR7My64Ksrbq8bKjol0g Princeton This place is down home as you can get that is if you lived in a rent controlled single room occupancy apartment Picture flourescent lights tables and chairs from the 70s and a framed paper poster Their bathroom is spotlessly clean which you ll need to wash your hands after digging into the perfectly fried wings crunchy outside and moist inside The sauce is more on the vinegary side than hot which is how I like my wings since I don t want a purple lip The wings are small or appears to be because the skin is thin I personally like thinner skins The fries are pretty good Not as good as Nathan s Famous or McDonalds but better than most Hamburgers are giant grilled patties on giant sized buns larger in diameter than a Whopper Also cool about this place if you like murder trivia is that the former owners were Lyle and Erik Menendez look them up in Wikipedia 
-13q-Wn9dR449oEEbgXdFw Princeton I ll admit it I was drawn in my the fact that this was the soup made famous by the soup Nazi on Seinfeld I thought I ve heard so much about this place it s got to to be good Man was I wrong I ordered the Italian wedding soup which was horrible It didn t taste like any Italian wedding soup I had ever had It was spicy and there were no meatballs Plus it was almost seven dollars for a little cup of soup I have had way better soup for 1 75 at my local diner This place is way over priced and over hyped 
-17H20-YK6gGymtYkM9YbQ Princeton I think the reason people are so impressed with this restaurant is because 1 It s in Princeton and 2 It s one of the least expensive dining options in the area I have given this place more than enough tries over the years but today was my last visit The menu never changes besides meat centric specials and the waitstaff act like they could care less if you re there or not Service is slow and minimal But the 1 reason that I will not be returning is because for the first time I visited the restroom A restroom is a good reflection of a restaurant because it exhibits whether or not they care as much about what you can t or might not see as well as what you can I expect it to mirror the restaurant s style as well as being clean and stocked at all times Suffice it to say Teresa s institutional unkempt dilapidated restroom did not meet that criteria 
-1r1BY0Z00kB9EgGQ0AJtA Princeton I ve always thought that this place would be like Lahiere s expensive without substance I was wrong I just had the best steak experience ever here The filet mignon was cooked to perfection Minimal seasoning but strong aromatic flavors from the beef itself It was extremely tender and juicy and the texture was otherworldly As the other reviewer mentioned the crowd here do tend to be a bit pretentious and overdressed People are in suits and ties fancy dresses everywhere Don t let that deter you The staff here are very nice The few times we ve been there we went in jeans and t shirts and we were always taken very good care of The only minor down side to this place is the salad The salads we ve tried beet pear were always way too sour For a person who loves vinegar it was still a bit too much for me Bottom Line really good but expensive place for steak Nice atmosphere 
-2I_B8CKI4fVcg44r_ls6w Princeton So i have been here a couple of times I have had good service and I have had horrible service so with that it s a hit or miss I guess Out of the few sushi places I have been to the shrimp tempura rolls are the best here Very big and tasty As for the rest of the stuff I guess it s average I would really give this place 2 1 2 stars but since I can t I bumped it to three stars just cause of the shrimp tempura rolls 
-4EBvsYbeLjxDdg6vgulJw Princeton We like the buffalo chicken pizza here Take out is recommended as the dine in is small 
-4fy42sGpKCdfAo2ttpywA Princeton The appetizers are awesome Out of the buffets I have been to I can say this place wins with appetizers However if you are looking for high quality flavorful sushi this isnt the place It is the average cheap all you can eat buffet If you want to get stuffed then this is the place to go with a group of people If you are really into sushi you will be disappointed with the quality of the sushi fish If you are really hungry and have no where else to go this will do 
-6cmWv8nhgEIyl8V84YScg Princeton I had lunch here for the first time this week and walked away satisfied I had a prime rib panini fries and slaw Friends had BBQ pork sandwich grilled chicken and lobster roll They all looked good to me I won t put all my chips on Tiger s Tale until I go back a few times but so far the food has been good 
-6oZZn9vCvs_zeI5LK06wQ Princeton An out of town buddy who I haven t seen in a while came to visit Of course I had to take her to my fave eating spot in Princeton Even though we were quite late they were pleasant welcomed us greeted us by name very nice touch although I m sure the maitre d just figured it out from my apologizing for our half hour tardiness and the name on the reservation and seated us immediately in the main dining room Service as always was impeccable throughout The perfect combination of low key so that we could enjoy ourselves and attentive They have three tasting menus with optional wine pairings but you can also order any dish a la carte and they will readily tailor your whole meal without a fuss to your dietary preferences vegan gluten free whatever and suggest better tastier alternatives for certain restrictions as you order Food is fresh and locally grown which makes the dishes delightful My friend and I both opted for a la carte choices rather than sitting through a full tasting menu After the amuse bouche we both started with the field greens salad for our appetizers This salad is not for everyone but since I have an adventurous palate and love things fresh and natural I personally love it As the waitress was putting my plate down I had a moment of panic that it would be drowning in dressing as I had forgotten to ask for the dressing on the side Not to fear it was perfect The naturally peppery sharp flavour of the greens came through enhanced by sweet but slightly tart lychee tomatoes I promptly scarfed the whole thing down It usually comes with chunks of cheese which my friend enjoyed I don t do dairy If you re expecting a traditional salad that s made from the stuff you get at your local supermarket and is then doused in dressing then I would pick something else For our entrees we had the lamb and baby eggplant The lamb came on a bed of beets and oyster mushrooms an unexpected but just delicious savory combination I was going to order the ratatouille but the server suggested the baby eggplant instead I was a little concerned about the ciabatta in the entr e since I m not a huge bread person but there was very little bread Fantastic choice I thought I was going to have an orgasm as I ate the tetrogonia or New Zealand spinach in the entr e which was cooked to perfection I ve never had such tasty vegetables in a dish Perfect mix of textures and flavors Another great choice on the menu is the short ribs We skipped dessert but they brought small brownies and other sweet nibbles with our check and gave us small pre packaged cakes on the way out the door All delicious On other visits I ve sat at the chef s table my first visit upstairs loft private party and of course in the main dining room Personally I prefer the main seating area My only complaint every time I dine here I get sparkling water without ice As it starts to run low the water guy invariably appears out of nowhere to refill my glass with iced tap water My glass is replaced as soon as I point it out but maybe they could develop a system to prevent this minor annoyance As to valet parking I love it Since I am invariably fashionably late the sooner I can abandon my car and sprint into my destination when I m meeting someone the better At any rate this is by far my favourite restaurant in New Jersey I keep coming back because the dishes are always creative use unexpected combinations are modified frequently based on locally available produce and taste sublime Great place for dates or special occasions too 
-6sHFac49degGxjO1QljFQ Princeton I came here with four other people and really enjoyed myself They had a great vibe going on you totally don t expect a huge place at the end of that long hallway The atmosphere is really cool especially if you sit upstairs They have a way back room with better lighting and heating lamps and I was glad we sat there Anyway we had the white bean dip and grilled brie everyone loved these They didn t give us enough pieces of bread so we asked for more and the server was nice enough to do so We all also got drinks IPA Pilsner and Honey I agree they felt watery but some were stronger than others Either way I don t agree that the price was a lot so it didn t hurt to try I did think some of their other drinks choices mixed or wine were pricey so I didn t even touch that Anyway mixed comment time I was overjoyed that they had a good vegetarian option a Seitan Chicken Club I was pretty interested to try this My friend also got it because he wanted to try seitan Well the damn thing didn t even have seitan on it It was like a cold fake soy chicken salad with tempeh as bacon and avocado on the bottom It was good especially on the bun but there was no seitan to be found So they lose a point for having no idea what the hell they are advertising Anyway my friends got burgers thought they were ok They have this ballin mayo aoili dipping sauce and fries I liked those the best Just try it out with some friends and have fun doing so 
-7i5uD-C-SUdeIF_-RVuIw Princeton Really nice decor The sushi is so so The Chinese food is better than most Prices are high and portions are small Service is decent Based on food alone I would have given another star but I always leave this place hungry or feeling like I just got taken 
-8umSeGYLAyobcadOy1LIw Princeton Ugh this place is dirty and the food is terrible Maybe the Indian food is better I doubt I ll be back to check 
-9IrpelIpfvmTe7O_BJxzQ Princeton When you walk into Elements you feel like your entering a very clean zen peaceful environment The decor and ambiance is a lovely change from most of the restaurants in the area We waited for our table at a very small bar with a very nice bartender Despite being crowded you still could talk comfortably and hear eachother at the table Two people in our party had the tasting menu which I would highly recommend Myself on the other had wanted the halibut only to be told they were out of it that evening It is a very different menu and unique presentations I could have done without the popcorn on my polenta appetizer My main course were the Colorado lamb chops which were tasty but a bit salty The dessert and complimentary cookies were lovely I also loved receiving a little sample of their pound cake when I left and enjoyed it the next morning with my tea I intend to go back and explore more of their menu 
-A3xt1tZeNhvUrwfmPtUqA Princeton Came here to celebrate and was not impressed I ve eaten at Gordan Ramsey s restaurant in London I ve eaten at places where my bill has been quite a small fortune I also can say that my favorite Italian restaurant in the area has been Padrinos where the pasta dishes are like 13 and feel like Padrinos is way better than this dump First off their 9 glass of wine is like a tasting 2 sips done and I m still waiting for the appetizer I think my meal was like 34 I got 4 small raviolis I m not a fatty 120lbs but the 4 raviolis was robbery I scraped all the remaining sauce in the bowl with their extremely hard bread just to try to satisfy my appetite Just feel like place is waaaaay over rated If you are looking for a special evening pay the extra money for Elements down the street 
-cBTp5rJtmF3Nwu46Ts5yQ Princeton This is a great little sushi place that s good to be close to The food in general has always been very good if not just a hair on the pricey side Still given the good ingredients and care taken in delivering a dish it s fairly worth it The sushi has always been dependably good and their spicy crunchy rolls have not been bested anywhere in my opinion The more traditional dishes are also very tasty I m not sure how authentic everything is but I go with what my mouth stomach like Jin the owner is very pleasant and she and her husband always seem to be there You can go there one night and be the only ones there and on another night it will be packed It is BYO but they re always ready with an ice bucket for your liquor which should always be sake I would definitely give them the edge and go for 3 5 stars 
-CjYR9iSKBXwqle7EaWxxw Princeton The food here was some of the worst I have had Mexican or otherwise I use quotes because the menu items are far from food Mexican My friend ordered the veggie burrito which was mostly just store bought guac They put tomato sauce on the salads Expensive for what you actually get They don t take credit cards The bathrooms are outside Service is slow Otherwise it is ok 
-dL9eP26h9NYtmnMSKCIsg Princeton Finally got around to checking out D Angelo Market this past Saturday One of the owners had come into our shop back in December and we were all anticipating it opening It was very busy so I strolled up to the hot food line and surveyed my choices I decided on an overstuffed eggplant parm roll 5 95 and a diet soda They were able to warm it up for me too They offered all sorts of different stuffed rolls strombolis calzones and hand made personal pies with very yummy looking toppings lots of fresh basic and simple ingredients nothing too greasy or gooey Their hot foods also featured chicken parm and eggplant parm and hot sides Right next to the hot foods line was a bakery selection The eggplant parm was absolutely wonderful It was thin and crispy with fresh mozz and sauce so good The dough for the rolls was also very good I didn t get a chance to check out the rest of the market as it was very busy but I hope to sometime soon to pick up some more Italian goodies It looks like they also have a deli counter and dry goods They also have plenty of seating if you want to enjoy your food there My only criticism and this could have been affected by the busy traffic was that there wasn t a smooth flow from ordering your food to paying for it I saw a couple of people that had eaten and then paid and I did wait a couple of minutes after receiving my food to pay I m sure this will get straightened out it s also confusing to where you order your food and etc But I will definitely return The price for my sandwich was also very reasonable 
-DWSJS6mqggttz6ZKac3hA Princeton My fam bam and I tried this place out for Mother s Day My brother dislikes the city for some strange reason we aren t related okay we are but this reason is enough to say we aren t so he picked a place in the Princeton area The restaurant is pretty small inside but nicely decorated It s BYO so be sure to bring a nice bottle of wine with you The service was impeccable Our waiter was very very knowledgeable about the items on the menu The bread and garlic butter spread was really tasty but I m afraid was the highlight of the meal for me We ordered the fried calamari with soy glaze sweet peppers pesto drizzle for an app and it was really sweet too sweet The calamari was breaded and soaked in a clear sauce Not appetizing to me at all My dad ordered the New England clam chowder and it looked and tasted more like corn chowder Even the waiter agreed I ordered the roast baby rack of lamb and it was also really sweet Cooked perfectly though medium rare All the components on the dish were sweet rather than complimenting It came with sweet potato mash and a slice of pineapple hidden within I guess this can pass as sweet tangy My dad s mahi mahi which was a special for the night was also sweet but cooked well I couldn t help but peek over at the next table and saw they ordered the seared scallops for their app the table on our other side ordered the oysters for their app Dammit We ordered the wrong apps I did like the bathroom though I definitely appreciate stalls that run from the bottom of the floor to the ceiling so you get privacy Did I take a picture Maybe don t judge me If I m in the area again I would come back and try different apps and a different entree With more wine My dad took my wine away after one full glass cuz I was driving back home I didn t argue he has a good 30 years on me 
-EBDS8sW_26a4uv4lz1zaw Princeton Honestly nothing strikes me in particular about Main Street It s an average place to throw away a few twenties at lunch Have fun I guess 
-eYTuzk6tvALcFnBszykGQ Princeton Honestly I think that if anyone opened a store anywhere in the world where they deep fry their food as much as Haven does you d have a pretty popular fanbase I m proud or should I say not proud to say that I ve had every one of their named sandwiches like the Dirty Sanchez Bloch Big Cat etc Sure what s not to love Its the epitome of a glutton s paradise deep fried steak filled cheese layered eggy 15 inch hoagies that can t be eaten more than two days in a row because they ll cause a heart attack Sure it s intensely satisfying in a way that McDonalds or Burger King tries to emulate that greasy zone where the brain shuts down It s very much like a drug in that respect I think that this place could serve worms if they were sufficiently fried and layered in cheese I have no doubt that people would flock to it wait in lines and rate it highly on sites like Yelp The only reason I don t rate it lower is because well it s good stuff in a I m going to regret this later primeval way that satisfies our carnivore roots For under 10 you can t get a better experience at any other fast food joint But now that I ve had all of their best I usually skip over Haven to some other place in Princeton like George s Roasters next door or the Soupman Go once go twice but don t go after that 
-F-bdkbqz6zilQWfPJyJ0g Princeton It has been said that all human action is driven by desire This being the case there s more action at Sushi Palace than in the latest Terminator flick Here s how it plays out The Sushinator that s you arrive ready to sushinate eat the sushi And you do Insane amounts of it And it only costs you 18 on weeknights All you can eat sushi is the new black these days but this place serves the best I ve tried most of the sushi places in the area up to about 50 person and this one trumps all of them in quality and presentation You can even request your own modifications to the dozens of sashimi sushi and specialty roles Furthermore as one expects in a top notch action context there are futuristic gadgets I recently learned that Sushi Palace has installed a infrared device in the ceiling that measures the angle at which your tea mug is accessed When the angle approaches 45 degrees this is slightly horizontal indicating you ve had oh maybe five to six gulps a staff member arrives to refill your cup with more tea You will never be without tea even for a moment at this place The host is also great the place is hopping especially on weekends but he always has a moment to let you know how the waitlist is looking All I can say is I LL BE BACK 
-F0C0bskJGts_o9P1fUUbQ Princeton This is the ideal meet the parents restaurant in Princeton close to the campus housed in a colonial style brick building right off Palmer Square with a risk averse Italian menu that is sure to please judgy Grandma and nosy adolescent sister alike At least that s the vibe I was picking up at here I think it wants to be an earthy trattoria but it can t help but reflect its conservative clientele The hostess was a bit on the snippy side perhaps because she was hesitant to give up a table for two for this lowly solitary diner on his first evening of his Princeton business trip Nonetheless they seated me at one right next to a senior couple who kept staring at me on my iPhone to alleviate their boredom The crusty bread came quick with a pool of olive oil with a dredge of oregano bits swirling about see photo I first went with the 11 Rucola E Noci which was a good arugula salad mixed with marinated roasted beets goat cheese orange slices and toasted almonds in a cider vinaigrette see photo It was fine nothing outstanding and not quite fresh tasting enough to stand out more in this Californian s memory For my entree I ordered the 19 Garganelli a tube shaped egg pasta which came mixed with spinach Parmesan and sauteed mushrooms see photo Again it was fine nothing wrong with it except maybe a bit paltry in portion considering the price Meanwhile I was watching the pizzettes coming out of their brick oven and thinking that looked pretty good by comparison But that ll have to wait for next time because I have to show Grandma my dorm room and introduce her to my roommate Hey stash my bong away dude FOOD 3 stars hey what s good enough for Grandma AMBIANCE 3 5 stars casual and convivial SERVICE 3 stars everyone looks a little impatient TOTAL 3 stars like I said risk averse I m surprised this is part of the same restaurant group that handles the exceptional Eno Terra in Kingston 
-FjmwkxoE0H8qScdLiyN5Q Princeton Awesome breakfast place Great thing you can look forward to if coming in on redeye from West Coast Although their coffee isn t the best But the pancakes are and that s why you eat there 
-FPHUXM9UJ_514UfVwuY0Q Princeton Fabulous Filet and the crab cocktail a protein lover s delight I ve enjoyed this place since it opened and I have to say it s been consistant I ve always found the service to be wonderful and feel bad for the reviewers that were less than satisfied The ambiance at night is warm and inviting just like a great glass of the red wines they offer Happy hours can be boisterous so if you are looking for quiet chose chose a later hour Outdoor patio is a wonderful spot to people watch while drinking one of the unique beer selections they offer 
-fSEZvHdYCxfipPsAjtONg Princeton i always dismissed this place because 1 i m a vegetarian and 2 since i grew up in the area i have seen many different restaurants pass through this location seasons anyone my family and i went out to dinner here on christmas eve and i was pleasantly surprised although there were few veg things on the menu the waitress had the chef make me grilled tofu skewers with teriyaki sauce over sauteed vegetables and rice YUM i was not too impressed with the two different wines i had the malbec and a cabernet sauvignon but my uncle had better luck with his ketel one martinis he had FOUR my mom thought the chilean sea bass was excellent and everyone loved the wasabi mashed potatoes the owner manager was hanging around and seemed genuinely interested in checking up on tables to make sure they were having a good time overall it s a pretty nice place good decor and it certainly beats all the chains around on route one 
-GtSjvKOAQ70HEY1-Ychiw Princeton P F always holds a special place in my heart this was my first classy Asian restaurant At one point in my life I didn t know that Chinese food stretched further then my neighborhood china buffet And then 2 good friends brought me here You could only imagine how I felt when I saw those horse statues out front of the building I give this place 3 stars because I have since indulged in much better establishments particularly ones that are not chains However the food here is generally good Everything has a fresh taste and is presented nicely The service is usually good and the waitstaff puts on a nice little show for you if you tell them that Its your first time PF virgins well get a kick out of what they have to say They also have a pleasing drink list The plum wine PFX and the Plum Collins are a few must trys They even have a long list of Sake if your into that I always get a kick out of dessert so much yummie goodness I usaully have a hard time deciding what little Mini Dessert I m going to choose Come here and enjoy the food and the environment the decor is beautiful 
-GYjoBazy0jggvCwR6Z1tg Princeton The chipotle mayonnaise is outstanding and the beer is QUITE good Honestly some people would find a way to complain even if they had undergone a total complainectomy and six weeks recovery 
-hrDWqXXJlNbiRkOfo6WrQ Princeton I had lunch at Teresa s on a weekday in 3 05 It s a light filled and charming restaurant and it seemed very popular The food was delicious the service was excellent and the prices were moderate 
-hxqljjvzYZ35TgzFBgzYQ Princeton Arguably one the best Mexican restaurants in Princeton but still not fantastic by any means Their dishes are overly cheesy and sauced just like they do at the chain restaurants not authentic at all The food is pretty good just NOT authentic If you want authentic try Viva Mexico in Flemington They only take cash and parking is a pain I d rather eat at Taste of Mexico 
-iE21Qemhijsr8dF-iOP1w Princeton This should have 1 5 but I d like to play nice We ve decided that this is spice central for Princeton Thai Mexican Indian We took in a bottle of rum to mix with a diet coke and mango lassi Ordered steak tacos and chicken fajitas with green tomatillo and spicy sauce Well it s Princeton The tacos were deep fried as mini burritos with the unseasoned steak pieces inside Served on top a shredded salad with sour cream infused guacamole much to my dismay as I can t eat sour cream but this was his dish I m glad I noticed that the guac was a little too bright avocados aren t that white so we asked and were told what we thought was the case Bummer Chicken fajitas not the separated variety grilled on one side warm tortillas on the other but fried with everything on top The chicken was good but not Mexican Good cheese too but not Mexican i m really trying here The tomatillo green sauce was very good light fresh hot spice wise The spicy sauce grew on me but using dried spices which were still dry in the sauce bugged me I ve been too spoiled with Chicago and California Mexican salsas The food was good enough not great I couldn t eat the pan fried tortillas as they were greasy before even the peppers chicken and cheese were added fajitas don t have cheese usually It was tasty but I so miss Mexican food that I m entertaining the idea of going to Mexico Chicago or California to get my fix The people were really nice food was delivered to the table It cost us a total of 17 for 2 
-ihwtFyzYAdE57A45GEMaA Princeton I ve come here a couple of times brunch and dinner Service is friendly and the ambiance is great Attire is casual which I absolutely love It doesn t feel stuffy or snooty it s just a relaxing and comfortable environment The food is good and you don t have to pay through the nose for a steak My favorite thing on the menu is their Classic Burger one of the best burgers I ve had It s nice and juicy served with lettuce and tomato on a great bun not your typical soft hamburger bun Oh and don t let me forget the KC fries homemade potato chips that are simply divine 
-IZvuqxekWEvJqDw308daQ Princeton Good quality pasta The sauces are refreshing I like the set up of the store 
-jHC9vDC1XOK3s94BqmRHQ Princeton Yummy I come here with my family all the time every time we visit sometimes for lunch but most of the time for dinner We usually order a bunch of dishes just because there s usually about 10 of us But all the food we order is good I especially like their Nian Gao I can never find any other place that makes it this way in LA The decor is ok It might need a little updating but it s not so bad Enough space for small and large groups I want to eat here again 
-jqGsAn0a-x5k6jOJlbgNw Princeton I live and die by their rib dinner ribs with tender fall off the bone meat with a delicious rib sauce along with amazing fresh out of the fryer sweet potato fries 
-JT3HkMXAaFvSw1MvjED3A Princeton Lobster bisque out of this world Price was extremely reasonable This place is a hidden Jem 
-junSxB4GVUpBtUbf4pddg Princeton This is real Italian wood fired pizza Not a Jersey slice place but artisan pizza using ultra fresh ingredients Very similar to Nomad in Hopewell but not as crazy busy yet We dined on the deck here last night and really enjoyed it all The highlight was the pizza with prosciutto arugula and shaved parmesan It s BYOB so bring your favorite to enjoy Service was a bit of a let down as plates and crusts were left on the table way too long Not a big deal and we look forward to returning again soon 
-KJP9tcUEWbm2mQnWvhGSQ Princeton Only white people who don t know anything about real Chinese food would go to this restaurant and call it good 
-Kjr8TxR6WWE2_npknJdWg Princeton The Triumph Brewing Company is an acceptable bar It has good beers they brew themselves and good food all a little expensive Unfortunately it may be the best Princeton has to offer which is a tragedy This place would be great as an alternative to many other good bars but as the best Princeton has it s just not good enough The first thing is that it s crowded I went on a Tuesday night and couldn t find a seat and had to wait half an hour for a table Most good college bars are crowded but the layout of this place doesn t make the crowd feel like a communal experience Its bar area is long and narrow which makes it difficult to mingle The restaurant is broken up into levels so that you feel alone Feeling alone in a large crowd is not easy but Triumph makes it happen There s a good selection of liquor and wine I m a beer man so I went straight for the beer The wheat beer was recommended by people on this site I tried it and found it good The Irish Stout was okay but I m not a stout guy The Irish Red was a little too heavy for me I like Killian s Irish Red but this was darker and heavier The beers were a little expensive more than 6 per Frankly this is a lot for a beer and especially a lot for beers that are just good I would not go out of my way to drink any of these three beers again and if I went back to Triumph I would only order the honey wheat The food was good Much better than the beer I had the vegetarian chili and found it surprisingly hearty I also sampled the roast arctic char and the pumpkin ravioli All were good They were sophisticated dishes cooked well with high quality ingredients Let s be frank though They were the cheapest entrees on the menu and overpriced at that We ordered them because the real dishes were a lot more I don t look for expensive foods at a bar I look for greasy food that goes well with beer However if you want expensive food this place is not bad Overall I liked Triumph okay If I was in Princeton again I would go there Its environment is not good its beer is okay its food is good and everything is slightly overpriced 
-KoDDJMsrgGox98KHP5FLg Princeton This place is super deceptive due to the small door and huge area inside with multiple floors The service is a bit slow due to layout and just things take long but oh well I got the pumpkin beer which i was very happy with since it was pretty late in the season Everyone else seemed to be enjoying their beers They had a great deal on the flights and had many options I m not normally a beer person but id come back for beer and probably only that The menu was divided up in appeitizers paninis salads sorta sad looking and real food dinners The appeitizers were calamari which was standard the tuna raw which came out in small pieces probably more for 2 3 people to share and the crab tater tots which were also not enough food For 9 people 3 appeitizers was sadly not remotely enough One of my coworkers got the last salad which was a mix of walnuts apples cranberries and she got grilled chicken on it The fries you can get as a side or with burger was very good esp with the sauce similar to the ones served at TGIF chipotle mayo flavored The Tbone steak was over cooked look a bit dry too and the lamb was often cooked over or very well The Triumph burger was good but not as good as the one at salt creek grill by a long shot I did like how you can put mushrooms cheese good choices and other things with it The sliders also were very small even compared to ruby tuesday free sliders There was a german first on menu under dinner food that was very large portions 5 different types of sausages and sides that looked awesome The prices were reasonable between 9 and 29 tbone steak The hanger steak at 18 was suppose to be pretty good and the salads and burgers were 10 13 dollars with sides 
-KXX9-oWf2o4uNXiSrlK6w Princeton I went to Triumph last Thursday with some coworkers after work for dinner I had never been to this Triumph although I have frequented the New Hope location several times It was interesting seeing how each venue had their own unique style I really liked the vaulted ceilings and wide open space We were seated in a booth on the lower level I ordered the Bengal Gold IPA which was excellent Our group started with the Calamari which was quite tasty The batter was light and non greasy and the marinara sauce was better than your typical rendition For my entree I ordered the Fish and Chips I am a Fish and Chip lover and I was very happy with my order The fries were crispy and golden and the fish was flaky and moist Other members of my party had burgers and ribs Every meal looked great and there were no leftovers All in all it was a really fun evening and the food was very satisfying I would definitely recommend grabbing a drink or a meal at Triumph 
-KZIDiL6gd7TLMPY3j-Kog Princeton Authentic and tasty Chinese food Their Shanghai soup dumplings xiao long bao are AMAZING with a thin skin and lots of soup The skin is just thick enough that it won t puncture when you re picking it up but not too thick that it ruins the skin to meat ratio I have eaten plenty of XLB in my lifetime from China to LA and I d say that these rank pretty highly in my book We also got Loofah with gluten Pretty good but some of the loofah si gua didn t seem fresh It had an interesting side taste that I can t exactly pinpoint but it was sill good nonetheless Recommended Bean Curd Skins with mustard greens and soy beans Xue Cai Mao I thought it was fine but my mother wasn t a huge fan The bean curd skins were the kind that you could buy at a Chinese supermarket The dishes were kind of oily but nothing overwhelming and somewhat expected at a Chinese restaurant The service was fine and the decor was actually quite nice perhaps I m just used to hole in the wall Chinese restaurants Unfortunately a bit pricey but from what I ve been gathering that s expected here Pleasant first meal in the Princeton area and I ll probably be back to try the nian gao and chicken with water chestnuts So to sum up in four words GET THE SOUP DUMPLINGS 
-L0hL7VXjdQkCiq4_X6FoA Princeton Small bar area drafty patio and decent food 
-LqP7iNkVe3Oo6VW1voDjA Princeton I ve been to a lot of sushi places in my day Many of them have been better than this but many have also been worse I had lunch and sushi with a friend and for the money the food was okay It was definitely nothing to write home about The service was wierd and the ambiance off If you re looking for something nice try one of the other sushi places in town 
-LsgmAAJDKLdu_H9uqNN-A Princeton We made a reservation for dinner on 8 31 and tried elements for the first time we had a gift certificate What a wonderful dining experience The food was fantastic and the chef accommodated and surprised us with an excellent dinner one of us is vegetarian The staff and service were impeccable We also enjoyed four amazing cocktails We particularly loved the Privateer It was extremely generous of the bartender magician to share the recipe ingredients and musings behind this cocktail on his blog We were so taken by this tantalizing drink that we had to find and procure all the fantastic ingredients to make these at our home bar These will tide us over till our next visit and we re very appreciative Can t wait to return for more culinary and cocktail experiences we re fans 
-M3wRUMbDdGgYRH9XpyCpw Princeton This is my A number one choice for when I need to grab lunch in Princeton Their salads are great they ll make a sandwich how you want it and I ve been pleasantly surprised by their specials Plus the peach almond muffin for dietary reasons it would be better to treat it as a cupcake is amazing 
-mDKbCtnn79kKgV4OPF1yg Princeton Very good very large menu everything was excellent Matza ball soup is very good even has some extra noodles It s not on the menu but I wanted soup and a sandwich but knew I couldn t eat both so I asked for a cup of soup and half sandwich perfect The pickle bar is also fun There is so much more than sandwiches something for everyone A great to go area as well Highly recommend 
-meg1WiwgOsctPPEHHeTaw Princeton I will occasionally stop in for a quick lunch but the thought of the unfriendly staff here usually keeps me driving on by Lucy s food selection is pretty basic salads pasta dishes of course some nice bread

-mlQbzFu5cpxNfjImehGKA Princeton I am shocked that Iano s doesn t have more reviews GREAT pizza dough thin with the perfect level of chewiness and crispiness Clean and affordable And before visiting Iano s I could not understand why people love cheesesteaks so much Iano s made me a cheesesteak believer yum yum can t wait to go back next weekend 
-NFSA9yl7ChcynPlWzEqHQ Princeton Some weird insane compulsions at this restaurant I attempted to join 4 friends sitting at a table here for an early dinner The place was empty The waitress got offended upset and only said no no no with these huge wide upset eyes I mean just at the QUESTION she became visibly upset They could have said no without being jerks about it right None of us were from Princeton so I guess we didn t know the rules of the sushi place Do you go looking for rules every time you walk into a restaurant I feel bad that people in Princeton have to deal with some crazy people because there s just no other sushi place PS I have many asian including Japanese colleages and friends I ve been to Tokyo I ve eaten at a millions of sushi joints I m part asian I know how to conduct myself respectfully in public These guys are just self indulgently quirky and rude 
-NlRWAGkhD6DlalTfp5oMA Princeton Calamari fabulous Mussels average Paella horrible I ve been here a few times and they re consistently average 
-nRer0iE_i88saYqQuqSyQ Princeton food here is very good 4 stars because there s not much for kids to eat cash only and byob parking is always a problem 
-On2qKoBU-ZEepcP_8hzMw Princeton Conte s is not a pizzeria It s a bar that serves pizza That s a big distinction so lower those expectations Got them lowered OK then now that your threshold for quality pizza is lower than my self esteem in the men s locker room at my gym I can say this is good bar pizza the kind that goes perfectly with a Hefenweiser with a slice of lemon It s not a student hangout for the Ivy Leaguers Oh no This hole in the wall place is for the rest of Princeton the regular folk And they do come here in droves Coming in on a Tuesday at 6PM with colleagues the place was already nearly packed They already have the little pizza stands at the table to save time The veteran waitress who served us was surly but the beers came pretty quickly followed by two big pizzas one just plain Cheese see photo the other a combination special with lots of goodies on top see photo of a slice It s low maintenance food for a high maintenance conversation Nothing fancy The End FOOD 3 stars good working class pizza for the rest of us AMBIANCE 3 stars just a bar and a crowded one at that SERVICE 2 5 stars Joisey style manners TOTAL 3 stars nothing fancy but solid food to be had 
-ORu7EiC3DfZjeKOVQ5ulQ Princeton I regularly went to get pad thai usually or other stuff here and while they weren t great it was good enough to have for lunch I agree with other people saying it is kind of pricy The service is usually good 
-PALO6MUBB0ZtFFm6D8H1A Princeton I ve been visiting Hoagie Haven since I went to high school at West Windsor Plainsboro South Years later I m still addicted to the place Although I miss the Bengali guys that used to make my food without any gloves on this place is the greatest I wish the current staff spoke better english and were better at taking orders I am a huge fan of the fat cats and make SURE you get the buffalo cheese fries I can t even imagine how much more ridiculous Hoagie Havens business would be if Princeton had more night life Hoagie Haven loyalist for life 
-PEo-bsETZAMZiQMh5Wukg Princeton Sunday lunch Shared mezze sampler that was utterly forgetable baba ganoush red pepper black bean hummus all sadly lacking in flavor Things improved once we moved onto our mains Ricotta Gnocchi was delicious silky light little pillows in a cherry tomato pesto cream sauce The Orecchiette dish was superb with house made pork sausage escarole garlic roasted cherry tomatoes Parmigiano broth Service left something to be desired We arrived 11 50am were told by the tween hostess that it would be 10 minutes before we could be seated A couple came in as we were walking out got seated right away Waiter seemed surprised when I asked him to replace my glass of wine as the one he brought had a ton of floating cork sediment and was half the normal portion Wine leftovers from night before Sloppy 
-PVCcuUtebICDthMx_TrQQ Princeton Honestly I went here a second time because someone LOVED and RAVED about this place and it was horrendous The food was incredibly cheesy hello the flavor does not come from cheese alone The prices were HIGH given the type of food given here And no credit card accepted Wtf Bottomline this place parades as a hip cantina style restaurant and because it s in princeton they charge exorbitant prices Drive the extra distance to Jose Tejas in Woodbridge NJ 
-q3vYbT3L5PnFuKyZba_lQ Princeton Wow I ve been an avid Mexican food fan my entire life and have tried pretty much everything in the area including Philly and this place blew them all way I haven t Mexican this good since my trip out to San Diego and Kaliente still beat them out I ordered a shredded steak burrito with tomato rice lettuce onion tomatoes jalapenos refried rice and shredded cheese on a habanero wrap It was the size a small soccer ball and tasted amazing My friend ordered the chicken version on a regular wrap without jalapenos and raved about it This place completely tops the other two Mexican eateries in Princeton Two burritos and a soda was 16 44 and worth every penny I will be back again and again 
-qKkU4ODk_PVFdfkO-DRJg Princeton There are enough other decent restaurants along this stretch of Route 1 Take a pass on this one I wish we had Overpriced food indifferent staff 
-qRjH-lwyt85F905Ced8PQ Princeton I went to Mo C Mo C first time to try out the food I went there around 4PM and the place was nice and quite just the way I like it so I can enjoy my food I ordered the following as I was with 4 other friends Lobster salad Spicy yellow tail roll Sashimi deluxe Toro Yakitori And two other dishes I asked for Chief s special creation of mix rolls and sushi pieces for 3 people First the lobster salad was to die for It has this sweet dressing over the honeydew and lobster made a great combination in the mouth The presentation of the rolls and sashimi were absolutely beautiful that I felt bad to take a bit But I was too hungry by the smell aroma of the Toro Yakitory soooo we down everything fairly quickly The place is cozy and quiet and as it gets dark out the lightening from the window outside looks directly into the sushi bar very nice view Since i ts BYOB we had plenty fun on top of the great food The only thing I don t like is that it s get busy and quick I guess people find this new place fast 
-qtMKUffHsYWDA3cVt00FQ Princeton I was EXTREMELY impressed with this restaurant First of all it was packed which is always a good sign but ample seating so getting seated was not a hassle and did not take more than two minutes I loved the simple menu it was not overwhelming and everything on the menu looked appetizing Now the food was out of this world My girlfriend ordered the lobster macaroni and cheese which was phenomenal and I ordered the chicken dish cannot recall the name that was mind blowing The flavor of the chicken was so delicious and expertly paired on a bed of creamed corn and spinach On top of the wonderful food the atmosphere was great Live jazz on Tuesday nights and a great interior Not too loud so talking is not too difficult and the wine list was more than satisfactory I was very impressed with my experience and will definitely be returning 
-Sn46GU3FyGWOXetrzAMyQ Princeton i love it here the food is mostly Italian so i m not sure why Mediterranean is part of the name the penne a la vodka is beyond good it s also byob will come back again 
-sPHY-L0J-OPb8oEDMWpzw Princeton Great sea food at resonable prices Buy wine next door for byob An unpretentious favorite 
-sVClsz3zpdp2lmeA_2yXA Princeton Always inconsistent The owner is never around and the staff doesn t seem to care about quality Pizza can be great or just awful with burnt crust I would agree with previous reviewers about the quality of their pita sandwiches The falafel can be very hard at times to simply great other times 
-TGOmBlxZW-v3rfyp5TUQg Princeton Best pepperoni pizza of all time the pepperoni is so rich greasy and what dreams are made of I only get around to coming here once or twice a year when visiting the best friend s parents so we always end up getting a large and almost eating it all this is 2 girls were talking about Don t question it s appearance or the way they make you order wait around then sit down and eat That s just the way things are 
-TR5aFkYoA00jRrQoZmBCw Princeton My name is carved into many tables here I ve been going to PJ s since I was a little kid I love their pancakes and mashed brown 
-u1cEL6lRa2iykQrkJvPww Princeton I love the huge veggie sampler platter Entrees are large so if you can t eat a lot at one sitting be prepared to get the rest in a to go box Service is friendly maybe slightly on the slow side but I think that s because many items are made from scratch rather than just kept under heat lamps in the back The matriarch who presides over the dining room can be a little cranky Definitely recommended 
-u9Kel3UPMaMVOZzEoi3fg Princeton 4 stars because of what the yelp literally says Yay I m a fan It is almost surprising that a city like Princeton small but with a lot of rich people suburbians and a UNIVERSITY seriously doesn t even have a handful of dining options I guess that made the PF Chang an instant success when it first opened a little more than 5 years ago When I first got there from Los Angeles where PF Chang is just a good option I couldn t understand why I had to wait for more than an hour and a half for a table here I rarely reviewed on a franchise and will never do much but wanna write a good review about my experiences here because of the scarcity of dining options at Princeton I think the ambience is great for that price service is usually fine but could be a hit or miss During the numerous visits lunch dinner take outs late nights you name it my favorites were the chicken lettuce wrap mongolian beef dali chicken which I believe is off the menu now orange peeled beef chicken honey crispy chicken shrimp and the last but not the least the chicken noodle soup Ever since my wife bought it for me long time ago I am in love with it I guess my review could well apply for other branches in the US Still in Princeton this sure is a solid option for nice dinner 
-UGSkc5pB4Z4xsPdOAoSEg Princeton The key thing with Carousel is to arrive with the right set of expectations Compare this place to PJ s in your mind and you will be happy with it It s open far longer than merely for breakfast but I only go there for my Sunday breakfast with the fam There s something for everyone on the menu even the most discriminating of young sons who hates nearly everything unless it comes with fries and the omelets are very good Huge menu The decor is much less interesting than the old Carousel but they ve kept a couple of the touches from the old place to give it an explanation of the name which is fine as far as it goes Recently they ve been raising the prices and that better stop or they will price themselves into a whole different set of competition Less greasy than a greasy spoon more comfortable than a diner food for any taste and all at a semi reasonable price That s why I like Carousel 
-uhoJyI_TcWPb-ryNts1bg Princeton I have ordered from Da s several times as I am an employee at the YMCA the organization with which the restaurant shares the facility SInce the cafe is just down the hall from my office it is an easy way to scrounge up lunch or dinner if I forget to bring my own I m hard on Thai restaurants because I became a fan of Thai food while living in Seattle which has an amazing array of Thai options which unfortunately for everyone else has set the bar pretty high The things I ve ordered have been a little hit or miss The western menu is not really worth the time so if you must give them a go go with the Thai infusion menu Usually when I order Thai I go for curries without hesitation since they are my favorite I ve ordered the Panang with wide rice noodles a few times and that s been good The rest of the things I ve ordered from the menu I could take or leave it s fairly generic Though I have to say nothing I ve ordered has ever been from Da herself since she doesn t do the day shift I will herald the Thai Iced Teas because good ones are hard to find and are non existant in Princeton I used to order them regularly from Da s during long work shifts and one of the employees there used to make great big ones for me Since then they ve started making them smaller and smaller so I ve stopped ordering them I ve actually stopped going to Da s altogether because of an unfortunate customer service incident I m a huge stickler for quality service when it comes to food service so I don t really take bad experiences lightly and they will turn me off to places entirely This one involved a staff member refusing to run my credit card under the 10 minimum required I had no cash I was a regular at that point and he absolutely refused to do it and raised his voice to me in the process I ve seen no need to go back since then If you re desperate for a Thai fix in Princeton check it out Da herself is incredibly sweet and takes great pride in her restaurant and abilities as a chef She even offers Thai cooking classes through the cafe if you re interested 
-uIdK6egYB6j2XNQZRKlXg Princeton Great food Good fun Good prices 
-umwNJfp9XeMUH7SjRdQnQ Princeton The varieties of puri and chaat are outstanding here I d avoid the Indian Chinese fusion combinations and go for the rest of the menu This place has the best okra dishes in town in my view and the mango lassi tastes fresher somehow than the same beverage at Mehek Flavor of India and Ganges are my two favorite Indian restaurants in the area They are far better than Masala Grill Mehek and Kalluri Corner all on or right off of Nassau at Princeton University but they don t seem to get as much business as those three due to their locations Whenever I get a chance I ll invite friends to Flavor of India or Ganges and it s always a hit It s not as good as the Indian places in Toronto but this is as good as it gets around here 
-UO-30CndTaDa6CgmbLTmw Princeton The catering sub tray is awesome People loved it 
-V6vli_FxT3q2-ITaQJTdQ Princeton Doesn t quite have the magic of the Marketfair location but I m a fan nevertheless Sad that the Marketfair location closed I ve found myself in Forrestal Village a few times recently enjoying this TB It tastes close to the other location but just slightly different Still for less than 10 bucks you can get a delicious fast japanese meal Give it a go don t let the location fool you 
-VLCpo_RNrP_wuUXDoiHJg Princeton Yes unfortunately my weekend of sub par experiences and awful bars continues I was on my way home from Trenton this weekend when I got caught in the 100 year flood Ok maybe it wasn t that bad but it was pouring out I was having trouble seeing and I was getting annoyed so I decided I needed a beer I went on my phone and saw what was in the area and the Tap Room looked pretty cool So after parking down the street and sprinting through the pouring rain I arrived The first thing I did was grab some napkins and wiped my face down since I was literally soaked through my shirt Once I was done I put the stack of maybe 5 or 6 napkins down next to me at the bar Pretty reasonable thing to do right So the bartender walks up to me and I try to make some small talk Man its raining out hard I had to stop and get a beer Her response with a cold look was what is this garbage Really Is that really the way you going to start are experience I m not in the mood and I it s not like I brought my trash from home and dumped it on the bar It was a couple of bar napkins I didn t want to let that ruin my whole experience so I tried to move on She asked me what I d like to drink and I wasn t quite sure I asked her if I could try the Weyebacher She responds to me once again with an attitude what do you mean try Most bars let you try a small sample of the beer and if yours doesn t just let me know but I don t need an attitude So to finish my rant I guzzled me beer left exact change and walked out I am a great tipper I worked in a restaurant for 3 years This woman did not deserve a dime of my hard earned money On top of my experience the Tap Room seemed stuffy and unwelcoming I looked at the menu and it was over priced and nothing special I agree with Jessica other then the pictures of famous alumni on the wall this place makes you wish you never stopped 
-vVmGX8vK8MR9Q6QSPlnGA Princeton Yummy bagel croutons Very flavorful and perfectly crunchy 
-VyQY7Y0oTcO-H_Y04z8aA Princeton This restaurant is by far one of the best I ve been to in Princeton and I ve lived here all my life I was lucky enough to partake in one of the Chefs tasting meals at the chefs table where Chef Scott Anderson delighted my friends and I with the most incredible selection of presentations I ve ever had The servers were wonderful and friendly the meal was exquisite Chef Anderson came out personally with each course and the drink menu was just plain awesome If you have any sort of occasion I suggest Elements more on the expensive side but the best meal you ll ever have 
-w7fag31mryOHbpiBE6XqQ Princeton ZOMG This place is AWESOME It s an all you can eat sushi and kitchen items salads soups teriyaki It s only like 18 95 a head their tag line is to Order All You Can Eat But Eat All that You Order They re not into waste and obviously no take home Their sushi rolls are outstanding their butterfly roll is a mango roll with a sweet chili sauce NOM Great dessert roll Anything spicy tuna spicy salmon all nomtastic Points deducted because my husband doesn t eat sushi He ordered chicken teriyaki he said it wasn t very good Sigh It s a BYOB but they also give tea as complimentary Fantastic whenever I visit my friends who live in the area we always try to get out here 
-xenpapIkGXRCe_zk0kS0Q Princeton OK here is the deal with Pizza Star It s not the best pizza in town that title definitely goes to Old World Pizza over on Nassau street but that place is for fancy Italian plumber gourmands who can t handle the reality of American pizza When it comes to your classic positively dripping with grease pizza with a large surface area that necessitates folding Pizza Star is the place for you in the 08540 When it comes to ordering 900 pizzas for your kid s weekend crayola birthday bash or whatever Pizza Star is the place for you Pizza Star has been the go to pizza place in Princeton for years and you re only going to disappoint your party goers when you bust out weird ass pies from Contes or Mossimos or whatever other non Star spot That is unless you re paying the premium and getting the Old World Pizza but then they re probably going to be uncomfortable what with all that unnecessary extravagance Yay pizza star Also I have heard that they have many other items on their menu that aren t pizza but this may be a myth 
-xfTWSK9WNrScSRj9276rA Princeton As a Restaurant this is a great place to meet friends have a drink stay away from the 17 glasses of wine and then go somewhere else for dinner Prices totally outweigh the quality in actuality the food was equivalent to the Longhorn Steak House just a fancier atmosphere With all the choices in this area don t waste your time here 
-xGme0ftHjQS9Tfqu2Uqmw Princeton Amazing coffee sweets and ever some decent options for a quick lunch the soups in particular are good Always a good atmosphere if you feel like doing some work on the laptop but still want to be around other people 
-YNiGCRAXDhS-ppsrHn4hg Princeton Its just ok Its a nice place they run it very well etc but hte food is just ok Definitely a popular place though always very crowded requires reservations etc 
-z1wSPoMW9whenkmrj-yYg Princeton I m not certain that whoever is in charge of leasing Princeton commercial properties remembers that we already have four Indian restaurants in town Would it really hurt to change it up a little Despite my misgivings I thought perhaps that Tandoori Bite had something new and exciting to offer that the others didn t Dinner here was more expensive than I imagined on par with Masala Grill prices and appears to specialize in saucy gravy curry based dishes The food comes in 3 spiciness levels mild medium hot I ordered medium and it barely had a kick Kind of disappointing My mutter paneer otherwise tasted fine though had a pronounced layer of grease on top Sits pretty heavy on the stomach Perhaps I should try the lunch buffet So in summary Princeton Indian restaurants are a bit lacking especially compared with the more authentic offerings just a few miles east on Rt 27 Still waiting for the inevitable moment that yet another Indian place opens in Princeton and hopefully that one will actually be good 
-Z9BgifY9HULI5qyS9WNfA Princeton Blew way past my expectations of a burger place Innovative set up and the service was incredible Definitely comming back 
-ZPWnCc8BHDrGhcfPFKSfA Princeton I too have been coming here for years although it s been a long time since the last time Great spot for a casual yet good bite to eat Good burgers and we are fans of the Irish nachos Good beer too 
-_VP7A6fVEGMtAp9VSJhaw Princeton This beautiful Greek deli located on Witherspoon has so many delicious choices for lunch dinner I ve sampled many of their fresh selections but the falafel and the hummus stand out as my favorites There are no tables inside but a small counter with stools in the back I usually grab something to take home or eat on a bench nearby You won t be disappointed as everything is fresh and tasty and expensive They cater too 
0-i0_adKUKM66PfNUC_KXg Princeton We used to come here every now and then but not anymore The last time we were there a few months ago There was an unwelcome visitor came to our table A COCKROACH came to our table I understand this is probably not uncommon at most restaurants but seeing it LIVE is a different story I will not go back again 
0-TcQPqWNkXpy4CGfGEhlQ Princeton I am surprised that this place has gotten such negative reviews I haven t been disappointed the last 2 times I have been here I remember that the Beef house noodles were really good The sesame chicken had a funny taste to it like it wasn t fresh or something was in the batter But like what everyone else said I think you will have a great time if you stick with the noodle dishes 
00HMm1C27MnUP4IhR7SS8Q Princeton Sushi wise just ok i dont think i d ever go for sashimi or anything but the rolls were fine service was good byo dranks i d go again 
00txJQyKXauO5Enev79DNw Princeton I wonder if the denizens of Princeton are miffed that Yelp s highest rated restaurant in their fair city is this unadorned sandwich shop with a steady stream of undergrads ordering their submarine sammies to transport back to their dorm rooms I had been curious about the place on my last two business trips here but never found the opportunity to go until now I ordered half of a cold hoagie the Provolone Cheese Pressed Ham and Salami see photos What did I think It was exactly what I wanted Speedy service Dirt cheap at just 3 50 Sloppy with all the fixings piling out What I didn t expect and I believe this is the clincher for people is the soft fresh Italian torpedo roll that housed all the ingredients It doesn t look like the bread is baked on the premises but it sure tastes like it The sliced meats are definitely a cut above the machine processed cold cuts Subway appears to use and the oil and vinegar doesn t have a rancid after taste Besides I walked in and out in less than four minutes FOOD 4 stars the secret is in the roll everything else falls into place AMBIANCE 3 stars not sure what to say except the makers wear plastic gloves SERVICE 4 stars not much for chit chat turnover is their goal TOTAL 4 stars hey if I was a Princeton undergrad in the middle of finals and out of Chex Mix and beer this is where I d go too 
01t1DKhyp-Bnogs2aiadDw Princeton I LOVE HOAGIES Even if it will kill me Give me a Sanchez please extra dirty 
02JtpTMu1QOVx-o3LM4D-A Princeton This restaurant is bare and stark from the front but pleasant modern inside We dined in the wine cellar as we were a party of 9 The staff was pleasant and efficient The food was far too ambitious for the kitchen and seasoning was either missing or too heavy handed especially in the overly spicy clams with no other seasoning and the so called foie gras with sauces which overwhelmed the palate Snails in puff pastry tasted as if they had been dumped from the can some bland sauce circling the plate far away from the escargots Wines are quite nice 
02yoYni5VEnlpanbvitc7g Princeton This place should be called Nassau Sushi but for some reason or another Yelp refuses to change the name on this business If I could I d give this place 3 5 stars Mmmm I can only imagine when this place served both bagels AND sushi what a deal Would you like a poppyseed bagel with your fatty tuna Or perhaps sundried tomatos with your yellowtail How about some cream cheese with your eel Apparently the owners realized how unique they were and decided to drop the bagels instead they ve revamped into a place selling Korean and Japanese food I ve been here twice ordering from their Korean menu both times The first time I ordered the Dolsot Bimbimbap sp which is the stone bowl version of the veg meat rice mix The bowl was pretty hot but not hot enough to crisp the rice Quite disappointing actually I had been hoping for something not so soggy The bimbimbap itself was kinda eh as the vegetables couldn t muster a wimper and didn t really add to the flavor of the bowl What I really needed was hot sauce though I can t remember now if I actually got any For the price though I don t think I got a fantastic deal The second time I came here today actually I ordered the Kimchee jigae the kimchee soup mixed with beef and veggies Luckily this dish came out fairly tasty The rice they served was a little on the wetter side I personally prefer drier rice That way I can douse my soup all over my bowl and come with something not completely soggy Fortunately they ve retained the Korean tradition of providing free appetizers Expect some kimchee when you sit down and maybe some sour spinach D I really liked their cucumber ish salad Pros Korean food in Princeton Mmm Korean appetizers Cons A little on the pricey side drop prices a bit and you might get 4 stars Verdict Middling Korean restaurant in Princeton that might satisfy your craving for Korean favs Keep in mind their selection is a little on the weak side and their prices could be a tad lower 
03Z-Dx7IIkGHbpUx-0Cbjg Princeton Ajihei is probably one of the only authentic Japanese restaurants in Central Jersey It s what you can expect from a real Japanese dining experience small space authentic food and real Japanese green tea The food is beyond doubt the best of its kind in Princeton Other places such as Tomo Ichiban Zen MoC MoC don t even compare Sakura Express is a whole other beast and I assume that people going there know what they re getting into for ridiculously cheap sushi Always served to perfection Ajihei does not take any shortcuts Their ingredients are mostly straight from Japan Ajihei is slightly pricier than other comparable restaurants in Princeton but the quality is beyond comparison For similar sushi anywhere else the price tag would have been much higher I must admit what I am most obsessed about is their tea authentic powered green tea that you can taste the difference of Tea like this is pretty expensive and you won t get it anywhere else The only discount factor for Ajihei is their small space and its associated complications Staff are sometimes so overwhelmed that it s hard to get your tea water refilled or you order processed fast enough during peak hours Long wait times for a table and inability to accommodate large groups are also annoying Bottom Line best quality sushi in Princeton Small space hence long lines during peak hours no reservations accepted 
04Clp-Jgs2o-38Rx8tjeSA Princeton We have been here twice Both times we had salads and pizza The first time we recalled really liking the pizza and thinking that the salads were fine The pizza reminded us of the thin crust we ate in Siena This last time the pizza crust was burnt Some people may like that but it overpowered the other flavors The salads were tiny and the chicken had no flavor at all The restaurant feels very cosmopolitan and the wait staff is professional The wait for a table can be extremely long 
04rukel7bpug5qivmGCRZA Princeton I liked this place alot They give HUGE portions I actually ate my entire plate on one visit 1 1 2 lbs of ribs My bf was mortified at my piggish eating sooo good I ve also been here just to drink and always had a great time Laid back sometimes crowded Always a great time1 
0595osDe6UXSYDO_K3HqTw Princeton Didn t actually get to eat there even though the menu was very tempting There were 2 customers ahead of me they were together and 1 customer behind me Even though there were 3 people behind the counter no one thought to ask me what I wanted while the 2 ahead of me tried to make up their mind I left as well as the customer behind me 
05Qfj2l1DJfvPmMnrcnUYw Princeton Nice decor outdoor seating The pulled pork sandwich was 14 and bland at best I don t know why but bland seems to be the running theme at most places in Princeton and Witherspoon Grill is no exception update Really good crab cake but rather pricey at 16 To be honest I don t think I ll come back unless my boss is paying again 
06nwV1CUZ6SBrIHWCkDZqQ Princeton Lahiere s is closing next month or at least that s what the rumors would have you believe This Princeton institution owned by two succeeding generations of the same family is going extinct So go get your fill of duck and risotto while you still can My favorite part of the restaurant is the bar and the bartender a great character where we ve had dinner many times The Bistro atmosphere makes for a fun evening Lahiere s menu has needed refurbishing for years just like the rooms themselves but the owners have steadily milked the business for cash and I suppose anyone with half a brain would have seen the sale coming long ago It s a shame because the location is tremendous the main room is well sized and it has a liquor license These are the simple prerequisites for success in Princeton A decent chef a good wine list and pleasant decor would top things off nicely making for a place customers would come to again and again but not to be The owners just don e have their hearts in it anymore I guess So say goodbye to this venerable spot the good wines the great staff and the fun bartender 
06RYyw_tZAYACYqpHkLqUA Princeton I ve known this restaurant for years and according to regulars who have been there this restaurant has been around since 1997 Compared to Ivy Garden every Princeton resident who has lived in the area in the past decade knows that Tiger Noodles has stood the test of time while Ivy Garden has shifted ownership multiple times Currently as of this review Ivy Garden doesn t exist anymore and no new restaurants have moved into the place I have been all over the Princeton area for 10 years now and I can confidently say that Tiger Noodles is the best around I ve seen a variety of people come to eat here and whether you re a college student or just a resident looked for some grub this place is affordable beautiful outdoor seating weather permitting and good overall service Seems to be always busy and packed every time I step in Food is very good probably the closest you can get to the real thing in NYC Chinatown The owners of this place also own two more Ya Ya Noodles just off of Route 206 in the Montgomery Shopping Center and another Tiger Noodles in the Windsor Greens Shopping Center off of Route 1 and I ve been to those locations too and both off their own unique experiences too As for service I have never had an issue with the waiters or the managers they are always kind and remember me by name when I stop in I don t particularly understand why this awesome place gets so many negative reviews but I guess haters are gonna hate Must go if you are a newcomer to Princeton NOTE They do NOT take credit cards but there are ATM machines everywhere in downtown Princeton so that s not too bad 
0924CigTgL5T8-qTr0fowA Princeton I come to this place couple times a month although the service is not the best their food is always consistent If you don t want to wait 2 hours on weekends I would recommend showing up at 6 the latest if not you will be waiting for a while for a table I am not sure why they take reservations because they can never honor it on a busy night If you want decent sushi with the right price and lots of selections this place is for you If you are looking for five star services then you should look else where 
094PeGYgc71DjD0ygKCr7g Princeton Great service The food came out with good timing and everything was fresh and delicious We wanted to try out some side dishes and made that our appetizer We had the adult mac cheese and brussel sprouts with andouille Both were great We tried the potato chips which were totally yum as well I had the house salad I know I am boring but it was great and it was huge My bf had the Blackened Tuna sandwich it was tastey but he was expecting something else Over all I would say the quality and service is there The menu isn t very big but the taste it there I would def go back again 
09xXxOYeRrz_r1VnUALscg Princeton Hand and fist above most in the area which considering the amount of disposable income is pretty shocking The environment and decor were quite upscale and hip not a personal favorite but was done well for the style They have a great beer list for a restaurant It s not Eulogy or Monks but had a few good Belgian beers I was not expecting Staff was very attentive and pleasant not overly fawning or on the other side snooty which can be an issue for me as I do not dress to the nines to go out to eat Started with a Pork Belly appetizer that was incredibly moist and a flavorful blend of distractions around it I would go again just for this Had the Muscovy Duck entree which was three styles of duck breast confit sausage with a tiny cassoulet I ordered the breast rare and it came as such which is generally not the case It was tender and savory The confit was delicious and not over dry in the least The sausage was the weak point of the whole meal it was dry though tasty We had no time for dessert as some of the diners had to rush to an event but they brought out a nice plate of petit fours one of which was a fruit jelly my personal weakness Overall I definitely advise dining here if you are looking for a meal you previously would have to travel to Philadelphia to get On a side note we had arrived late and only had forty five minutes for dinner and asked our waitress if that was a problem and she did not in the least seem put out and made sure everything came out in a timely manner We in no way felt rushed or left behind Been back multiple times and just wow this is THE spot to eat in Central NJ There are also two grades of tasting menu one which is just selections off the menu and another which the chef cooks just for you I advise you take the time and have the latter 
0b50RxP52uwJTDEZy-U1GA Princeton Some of the best sushi I ve been able to find in the Princeton area Small place with simple decor but excellent cuts of sushi Some of the best eel I ve ever had so if ur an Unagi fan don t let the Market Price scare u off It s worth whatever the market is dictating Loved the tuna handroll always like when u can actually see the fish in a spicy tuna roll I highly recommend this place if ur like me are all about good sushi I had to open my own wine bottle BYO couldn t get take out on valentine s day but I m over it Service was friendly enough for me but place is small RSVP recommended 
0BBiT8OXPrCOnIoLP5GdgQ Princeton this place is overrated it s just buffalo wings If you don t like them you aren t going to like the ones here either Buffalo wing sauce tastes exactly as expected The only difference you may taste is the wings are crispier than usual Sesame noodles are just cold noodles with sesame and cilantro there is nothing special about it and it s certainly not worth mentioning as great would not come again 
0BPuIp6IIemeZAwYAP9SOg Princeton This is a wonderful restaurant The staff is extremely nice and helpful The menu is a little tricky as it s assumed that you know what s in a philly roll for example But outside of that they have a good variety of dishes from sushi to thai to malaysian food so it s really great I ve been here a few times and never been disappointed 
0czRZESrnAenizg_3q7YBA Princeton If you re not sure what to get I recommend starting with the roti canai pronounced chanai appetizer a freshly prepared flat bread which you tear up and dip into a chicken and potato curry I always get the penang char kway teow a seafood dry fried rice noodle contains shrimp and calamari among other things Other favorites the Thai basil noodle a little spicy the mango chicken and the very sweet and flavorful Thai style ice coffee or ice tea 
0dMN_oByLuHDVmLO2QPBjw Princeton Meh sums this place up The food was just meh I love diners and most of the time I can find something I like I went to the Princetonian with my brother and his roomate and we all had breakfast I ordered the challah french toast with two poached eggs The french toast was very bland and I didn t finish it The eggs were fine but the coffee was really terrible like it had been sitting out for some time The service was good but I left wishing we had gone somewhere else For the price they charge it wasn t worth it 
0EAOXNkEdel26eORVQXVvg Princeton Love Lucy s they also opened a restaurant in Rocky Hill 113 I think Great sandwiches fresh pasta and sauces large selection of dishes to choose from for take out and reheat for dinner There will be a long line for the lunch crowd the line moves rather quickly and its worth the wait 
0fgd8BUJR2F2Vsqkuogxkg Princeton We love the atmosphere the great beer and good food here I love the Irish Red Ale with a burger or falafel My husband likes the lamb chops The fish in the fish and chips was a bit too battery for me The restaurant is easy to miss the first time you go but it s next to Panera which is impossible to miss 
0G2chAzpxNhS4jc73QadJA Princeton This is just your basic American food place with a bar It s kind of like a TGI Fridays but more expensive Covered in old skool Princeton memorabilia unique forks 3 prongs very medieval looking decent service The portions are large but even still the prices are high for such basic unremarkable food The menu isn t very exciting or exhaustive I ve never gone there because I had a craving for it I ve gone because it s convenient and slightly less expensive than the better restaurants around I ve never been there later in the night for the bar scene though 
0Ga9ioL9Gswv0d9G10Eoug Princeton Expensive place for mediocre Chinese influenced Japanese food We had dinner once at this place and be warned that this is a tale of disappointments The high point of the dinner was walking into the door and noticing the design of the space It s nicely decorated The waitress who came to take our order shortly afterwards was stone faced and slightly impatient To her defense we were ordering one entree to share which understandably can be annoying The miso soup came out after a long wait it was lukewarm and extremely bland It was like having leftover from the night before The salad followed iceberg lettuce with large slabs of ginger dressing Standard fare for cheap sushi places but here Another extremely long wait Close to 50 minutes after we arrived our entree finally came It was doused in sauce another standard thing for really cheap chinese japanese sushi joints but again here For this price 20 Overall this was a sore disappointment Everything including the food is fancily presented but tastes even less than mediocre The cooking of this place reminds me of the late Ichiban Zen where mediocre MSG doused foods rule Bottom Line You re paying for the decor nothing more 
0GlKO5aVgtI8aERuIfOtjg Princeton 2 5 5 This place is incredibly expensive for incredibly mediocre food The bibimbap is okay but I ve had better Their sushi rice is very vinegary if you like that but their sushi in general is small and again just okay Anything with bulgolgi is overpriced and the meat itself is tough dry and flavorless Plus the amount of rice they give you with entrees is a travesty It s all conical shaped to be cute but it s barely a morsel and they charge you for extra Save your money there are plenty of better options on Nassau 
0glZ2eP1d_Nl3cKOKhgyGA Princeton I tried this place for the first time a couple of years ago while in town I am pretty sure I had ordered either cashew nut chicken or kung pao chicken and I remember it being good So being back in town again I ventured here with a friend for dinner We ordered the Seafood dumplings for starters These were pretty good I ordered iced tea to drink On the first sip it clearly tasted like there was some kind of soap in it I had to cancel that off my order and drink water I noticed on the menu they had Mango chicken Now back near home in Webster TX there is a restaurant called 888 Bistro that has really awesome chinese food The Mango chicken there is incredible and everything I ve tried not to mention the best crab puffs on Earth So assuming that Mango chicken may be somewhat similar here at Tiger Noodles and willing to experiment a bit I ordered it As another reviewer commented some things are apparently better than others The Mango Chicken blew goats Not even close to my beloved 888 My screaming plate of pathetic had skinny little slivers of chicken with about 10 billion hard french fry looking pieces of mango I could have built a fort with these things I ate a third grudgingly and had to stop Might be looking elsewhere for my Chinese fix next time in Princeton 
0hASL8-J3DelTzBxS-i9gA Princeton We really enjoyed eating at Teresa s and have made many visits There are many things to choose from but I love to get the salad pizza and a glass of wine Parking can be a challenge and it s often crowded but worth it 
0hjTRY0gAesASO76FRFFhw Princeton Tasty Great Malaysian food 
0hnuZ261HA_6Qv7NTm9cNQ Princeton try the raffaella white pizza roasted garlic mmmm mmmm good my new favorite 
0hQENXaD2WYhvQsmLydQmA Princeton Great place for Chinese food I ve been coming to this place for 3 years now and it never disappoints Very friendly and family owned Definitely a recommended spot one of my usuals 
0hx4aJh6J3cFfV3AM9Ey1w Princeton This place is overpriced and the crowd is all 20 to 30 somethings desperately searching for a good time in the middle of suburbia but I can t help it I love this place This is another example of knowing what to order Skip the high priced fancy sounding stuff and go for the sandwiches burgers and appetizers They re all incredibly tasty and the chipotle mayo that comes with the fries is to die for I almost always get the burger when I m here because it s heavenly Before I was 21 I liked this place a lot less than I do now but having happily turned 21 a couple of years ago I can finally drink here and my rating has definitely gone up The beer is unique and delicious and I love the seasonal beers The variety itself makes coming here a treat My boyfriend won t go here anymore because apparently he saw a roach crawling on the wall while he was at dinner and the management did nothing but look annoyed at him for pointing it out but until I have a bad experience I ll keep my rating as is 
0iD4qELmglvvsOjVDPBN-Q Princeton This place has degraded over time used to be reasonably sized portions and good service we came to Penang for lunch with a group of people the waitresses we FLYING by so that you couldn t even ask for a glass of water the size of dishes that were served would probably not even be enough for a 5 year old let alone too small for adults This was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT and I will definitely Not be returning back anytime soon 
0ID9-Ns77YuJztCSPctrVg Princeton Really enjoyed eating here during my years at Princeton I remember the times when I ate so much food that my friend had to carry me back home on his back I think I ate like 15 gulab jamuns after my monstrous helpings of curry Ahhh Kalluri good memories good times 
0IoPnhUpy4YSN1lL4jBA-w Princeton Went to tortugas w a friend for dinner Thank god for the company otherwise my 40 tip spent would feel worthless A few things about this joint before i head into my review It seemed like it was BYOB Also NO CARD SO MAKE SURE U BRING CASH My friend and i had no cash so i had to walk over to the deli about 5 min away towards to hospital to grab money from the ATM not cool Chips and salsa acc to their website are NOT BOTTOMLESS The first batch is complimentary So savor the free stuff Their new location is across the street from the old location Street parking Pricey Around over 10 for an appetizer Clean bathroom 2 floors Location Off the beaten path It looks like a real estate building in a residential area Its weird and took a minute for us to realize that this was the location They need a brighter sign actually they need a sign period The restaurant name is written on the door But i guess its good for patrons who want to keep this place a secret not too much the owners Food Not bad but definitely not the best ive ever had Im not a connoisseur of mexican food by any means but NOTHING compares to Jose Tejas Even on its worst day jose tejas i think in woodbridge knocks this place out of the ballpark That being vented appropriately the food was mediocre I got the chicken fajitas They give you three tiny flour tortillas with rice guac sour cream and chicken The chicken are the size of chicken fingers they are not cut up to be served in a fajita so i had to cut it up However it was spiced pretty well i just needed to add salt The rice and beans were good but i didnt like the guac I thought the guac was over processed and dint have enough garlic my brother s guac was better than this It tasted like it came off a shelf i hope not The grilled peppers and onions were really good as well Service just okay I was seated in a heartbeat on a table for 2 While i waited about 10 minutes for my friend to arrive i wasnt rushed at all There were 2 menus chips and salsa waiting for me I tried not to eat the salsa because i read on their website that the firest batch was complementary and the 2nd was about 3 which is the LAMEST THING EVER BTW Oh yea the pico de gallo salsa was too salty for my taste But it tasted fresh Service nothing special BOTTOM LINE You lost me at no bottomless salsa chips oh dear tortugas Get ur act together Also stop being so pricey Just because u are located in Princeton doesn t mean its cool to charge 12 for guac dip that s about 6 at on the border Cost us 41 for 2 entrees 2 sodas OVERPRICED AND OVERRATED My suggestion go to on the border if ur in a rush If you are planning a mexican dinner please please head over to jose tejas they seriously are the best 
0IUEjnmTiJnCXPk21TNoAg Princeton My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary It was an older crowd for a Thursday night Very nice atmosphere for a group of friends or date The food was just OK but generally satisfying The bread was stale and served with a bean dip That was odd Menu was limited Portions were large We ordered the bruschetta to start Bruschetta is pretty easy to make however I wasn t pleased with the way it was prepared no basil Really The corn chowder was really good I ordered my steak rare as I usually do but I guess it was my mistake because it came out raw and mostly inedible for human consumption I probably wouldn t come here again since it didn t really impress me for the price 
0J8m2JNwuCMpbRaHTcYs_A Princeton I wouldn t disagree with reviewers saying this place might have the best pizza in the town of Plainsboro which is a really small town by the way We usually had a late dinner take out of medium or large pizza with chicken wings around 20 bucks total I think they are pretty good The guys working there are pretty nice too 
0jD0EHkfU84S5KMgJzBIaw Princeton Avoid Food is meh and insultingly overpriced if you are any kind of conscious thinking lover of food Service is okay but slow I hear the drinks are very strong and well made but I don t know this personally Wait times can be absolutely retarded even if you have a reservation I d rather go to the food court and eat at Teriyaki Boy no joke 
0JiqK11sA1sDx0FvQkFo_w Princeton My wife works in town so i usually meet her after work at least once a week for dinner We have been visiting La Mezzaluna for quite a while now and are very happy with their food and service Recently my wife has had some dietary restrictions imposed that limit what she can eat being a carnivore myself I never appreciated the challenges people on special diets face when going out to eat The Chef and wait staff have been very accommodating to my wife never flinching when my wife ask to dismantle one of their wonder specials As for me I am a huge fan of the pasta with fresh clams in white wine sauce it is not on the menu but they will happily prepare it for you if you ask My favorite dish home made Gnocchi with shaved Black truffles 
0lE5GDTHwBaBVj7d0Ymnqg Princeton Had good seafood here 
0LgxTBDYzpoQ7UuJdtZQrw Princeton the service was excellent the atmosphere was good enough although too dimly lit the meals were very tasty the pricing was overboard it s simply too expensive like most places in princeton does affluence make people stupid apparently these same people own the fish market that adjoins the restaurant i went in one day and got 1 swordfish steak and 1 cod fillet the guy at the counter told me my total was 48 are they smoking crack in the walk in i told him to unwrap it and put it back on display i went to the shop rite and purchased comparable i swear goods for 23 jersey fresh farm market on rt 1 south in south brunswick by the old j j plant has EXCELLENT quality fresh fish and decent prices 
0lwkuYPAFBFb2lIZ-Hht3A Princeton Their lunch buffet is tasty and has a good variety of dishes I like the buffet because you can try a little bit of everything The naan is very good Not the best Indian I ve ever had but certainly a decent stop for lunch when you re craving Indian food 
0lWlIQu9DmVvVkB_qyB9bw Princeton This place has a really great outdoor patio and bar the atmosphere was my favorite part Overall above average food at a reasonable price but the parmesan asparagus side dish was exceptional 
0mmSIFy7oHYzTbcpYKOZmw Princeton I had Tico s Signature Panini here for lunch one afternoon and enjoyed it thoroughly The steak was deliciously marinated sauteed onions were fresh and zesty and the cheddar cheese was of good quality because the flavor wasn t overbearing I ll definitely stop by again next time I m in town 
0n3EyqEh-RXFFTVH0T5SmQ Princeton This is the biggest Panera I have ever been in They even have a private room for events Panera s food is solid and its one my favorite chain places We were here for breakfast we arrived around 10 am and they still had a souffles I have noticed that many other locations always run out of them around 9 30ish The service was great everyone was friendly and the place was super clean Actually this was one of the best meals I ve had in Princeton over my little two day stay there 
0n7K89ftfWicp4m0pZ3hXg Princeton Just because it s a local non chain place doesn t mean it s good Bucks County Coffee Co Such garbage Luckily Small World is one of the good ones I went here a couple times a week more or less for about ten years I probably had everything I was ever going to have many many times The drip coffee and espresso here are superior to Starbucks Anything that uses chocolate powder here is just not worth even comparing to pumps at Starbucks The iced coffee here is way better lest you need a 31 ounce version The credit card thing that s just never going to change I guess I certainly never would have went to Starbucks had SW accepted credit cards But they d probably have to raise their prices to cover the processing fees if they did start taking cards Not to mention the longer lines and increased time waiting around The whole congestion thing and line flow definitely an issue sometimes In general they re just usually so crowded It s definitely super loud in here I don t know how one could study here but people do If you re in Princeton and you like coffee this is the only game in town 
0NFVEQIScslTrOlfupNEBw Princeton Poor service poor food poor decor and expensive I think it stays open because guests at the next door hotel come here without knowing any better 
0nhW8h3JkLJIzzqVEwN0-A Princeton New Jersey Italian Reviewing only the take out sandwiches Surprisingly good We were hungry road tripping and escaping the Turnpike via Rt 1 Pulled in here in the snow following the garish PIZZA sign to the back of the plaza across from the Home Depot It turned out to be a real restaurant in the back where folks were eating lunch but we just got sandwiches to go I had the special prosciutto with cheese and roasted red pepper and my dining partner had something more boring off the normal sub menu Both were good though mine was more flavorful They put the subs in the oven which I didn t expect not being from the area It was very New Jersey You want I should take them out no no I ll wait that s fine Ok here puts sandwich on a paper plate stuffs it in a thin paper bag You come back soon Um ok But seriously the subs were good 
0O8BF4FH7pGu4bxZj902Ig Princeton I have been to KC Prime at least a couple dozen times over the past 10 years In my opinion I think that it is on the decline Their menu has not change much or at all in a decade and their specials never change My guess is that they had a good chef a while ago and eventually he left and they kept everything the way it was before he left My wife and I went to KC Prime last night and I was really looking forward to a good steak I ordered their cowboy aged ribeye which has been offered as a special for at least my last five visits It was not very good It was tasteless and very very tough The steak was not worth the 40 dollars that I paid My wife s meal was better but she order their apple desert and it was pretty bad She didn t even really want to eat it In summary the place is in the decline I ll think twice before returning 
0OmL3huDBZpnXBcIzplQUg Princeton They have the best buffalo wings and fries freshcut that I have ever tasted period 
0oSgHaCHm9z_AZMCHvGBIw Princeton The service and quality of the food is going down hill What s going on Also the happy feet behind me was unpleasant on a recent visit Mentioned it to the waiter and he shrugged and went away Switched sides with Jim and 5 minutes later there was another set of happy feet Will never sit at a booth there again first set 20 s 2nd set old professor type 
0p44cADDU9SkeUTCFYr0IA Princeton First visit to One 53 and we thoroughly enjoyed it Glad I made made reservations for Valentine s day dinner as clearly it was a popular choice Appetizer Salmon Tartare and main courses Yellowfin Tuna Seared Rabbit Loin were excellent Did feel that the cheese plate for dessert was way over priced for what it contained Only other detractor was that our server was not particularly friendly Look forward to another visit 
0pLM0oEjRxaSe2B67DTgmg Princeton I frequent the restaurant side of Cafe Colore every now and then The food is good and the service is fast and friendly during lunch time Today I had the lobster ravioli with mushrooms in a cream sauce I ate every last bite 
0pru5qDW8egK-9N6PrgD8A Princeton Liked the ambiance 
0pS1Z2Gm8mFIKjZwnoxRTQ Princeton Have gone back twice just for their burritos The burritos are great healthy everything is fresh and the black beans are amazing Not sure how they prepare them but they are the best I ve had I have gotten their fresh fruit smoothies too Pretty good Good service as well There is a 10 credit card limit but I have spent less than 10 and they still let me put it on the card 
0Q7diiKEONgY6sAPBWuirw Princeton My fiance s friend has his Indian wedding here The food is good the ambiance especially for the reception was pretty good The service people were decent The location is pretty much in the middle of no where so there isn t much to do in the area Overall not too bad 
0QeFExyayyD25sgVPMbeBg Princeton I was Googling this spot bc my bff is meeting me there tonight and low and behold I have been here before for brunch years ago and I the only thing I can remember is that the bread they serve you prior to your meal was pretty good Oh And the decor was pretty modern That s it 
0QvRfPP-G3wu6s8Cy1xLjA Princeton What can I say I have been eating here EVERY SINGLE WEEKDAY for the past 4 years or so L2 Gyu Don IS the best it s not written on the menu but you can ask for a spicy version of it if you like L4 Curry Chicken very good too I get this when I get tired of L2 which is very rare L1 Beef Negimaki is something you should definitely try once when you re in the neighborhood NOTE There is an amazing dish called Curry Chicken Don that is NOT on the menu You have to ask for it 
0r0uoxG5JcOOtxjpYBO9HQ Princeton Pretty average food I suppose the only reason it really have such positive reviews is bc there is a seething of breakfast places in downtown princeton Its definitely on the higher end of prices no where near Normas but still high for what it is Just don t expect anything above diner quality 
0rpIsi0tABvl2Nun5HlIfg Princeton Came here on a weekend night expecting a crowd considering the place doesn t look abnormally large It s a decent size inside but setup a little awkward with too much open space and a view right into the prep area Either way while every other place in the area was crowded no one was here typically a bad sign in my book Decent selection of food although my boyfriend and I were given menus with two different daily specials on them When we asked they said it was all special so that was a little weird I ordered the mango duck which was incredibly too sweet pretty much all mango syrup and a side of duck The boyfiend s sushi was amazing though Overall I d say just okay Probably best to stick to the sushi 
0S8chSDOyY-CqIbMyAVzVQ Princeton PROS good ambience CONS average food 
0sMCVrTROS_8cNNVTzB7yw Princeton Went here for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend Atmosphere and service are great We were seated outside The food was fresh but not up to our expectations given the reviews The grilled octopus was a disappointment There was no flavor and it was just greasy tasting I am not even sure if they used the proper olive oil since it was lacking in all flavors If you want to know what good grilled octopus is supposed to taste like go to Varka restaurant in Ramsey I suggest the chefs in Princeton make a reservation Also authentic calamari is floured not breaded Overall it was a nice night but I wouldn t go here again 
0ss1AeT5fxDALD23FnrH0g Princeton Decent burger but the chili and pasta fagioli were sub par The gnocchi was drowning in a thick cream sauce The service has to be better than the dolt who drifted back and forth to our table today The vibe is a charming college town feel I wouldn t recommend this place for anything besides pancakes At least the bathroom was clean 
0sws-FV5WRTl37w-cXzvuA Princeton Their cheese slices have never disappointed The fancier ristorante which shares the kitchen also has good food 
0TGXQ2Zq2a_aiq6G78F2Zg Princeton I ve only been here on the weekend for dimsum but haven t had a chance to order off the regular menu The dimsum experience was a bit disappointing as they lacked the traditional carts being pushed around The dimsum dishes were ordered off the menu making it somewhat of a surprise game when the actual dishes came The food overall tasted decent Flavor and authenticity wise I was not too disappointed The quantities and sizes however were a bit on the meager side especially with the sesame cakes being half the size of a golf ball The soy milk was a pleasant addition to the menu but they lacked the option sticky rice as a side The staff was generally friendly but we felt rushed and they gave us the impression that we were taking too long to decide Dimsum is a several hour event Other than that the quality of the food is not bad wish there was more variety and options on the menu I may be back to try the main menu but do not have high expectations 
0TutZ7SzNive5FSFSxw7gQ Princeton Incredibly expensive fresh fish without any clear reason why They re definitely not wasting money on floor space its really difficult so shop here because the public space is so tiny We headed here on a quest for something delectable for a special dinner expecting to pay a bit more than usual but also expecting to be able to discern that we were getting something special for our extra money Even expecting to pay a lot I lost my appetite reading the price signs stuck in the ice among the fillets and steaks We headed to WF which had most of the same offerings at much lower prices and with a lot more detail about each products origins than is provided at Nassau We ended up with a gorgeous Copper River filet which tasted that much sweeter knowing it came at a fair price 
0tW697ty3aT0GjhvoilWPQ Princeton I really enjoyed our lunch here It was a reasonably priced for fine cuisine and you won t leave hungry We had the tuna tartar which was excellent Elbow Macaroni Bolognese and Marinated Lamb Sandwich All were tasty dishes and the atmosphere was very nice The other favorable reviews are spot on 
0uey1jUP7-CU-5amahQBxA Princeton Ganges is great I was somewhat tired of the places in town Princeton where one indian place takes an hour to make your food and another is just so expensive and charges extra for rice and this place is right near my chiropractor so I m passing by once a week at least We ordered a ton of stuff since we had family in visiting and that s a great way to try a place out I was a bit taken aback by the RED colour of the Chicken Tikka Masala but it was YUM The food is noticeably not greasy and all the dishes were good all of the family was happy I recommend this place to all those Princetonians who are fed up with our in town choices Ganges is better faster less greasy and cheaper 
0UTGXd6-4R8v3l99TgTbrQ Princeton Why go to Grease Trucks when you can come here I have never had these types of non cold cut sandwiches before and could honestly say I am fan The sandwich combos are pretty good but pretty unhealthy After I was done I got the same uneasy feeling after finishing a hot pocket I did not find the prices to be too much considering how much you were getting 
0UUBxIM4jWiQF16CIWe4Kw Princeton This is a pretty cool hipster coffee joint It s kind of cramped but I ve always got my joe to go Coffee is solid and much more unique distinct and flat out enjoyable than national brand coffee chains Great stuff 
0uwl-XwDRz1Fl8xZIGiR9g Princeton west coast just can t do hoagies like the east actually they don t even call them hoagies i had the capicola ham salami provolone and the philly steak both were excellent i ve had the real philly steaks in philly and this one can hold its own although i like the ones in philly better you can t really eat inside so we stood outside chomping away unfortunately i won t ever be in the princeton area anytime soon maybe never i ll just pray that my son or daughter goes to princeton 
0V-Bg44QZ33mNUY2Av6ZQA Princeton I ve been here a few times The beer selection is pretty good and the prices are reasonable for Princeton I like the sandwiches and the fruit salad with goat cheese is pretty good The service has been good each time I ve been here and it has a nice ambience 
0VKS3IRk1ZFVt2Kf4lSzJg Princeton Loved the service Main course was tremendous Appetizer promised much but delivered unusual mix of crab meat carpaccio and arugula Fussy presentation for what seemed to be good quality food Thought drinks were overpriced given locale This is not Manhattan but they are charging Manhattan prices 
0vm6YAOIQJboCXUiAH6KSQ Princeton Some 25 years ago when I was just a budding geek the precursor ritual to an all nighter at the E Quad was to pick up a monster hoagie built to be nibbled on till morning Hoagie Haven could probably lay claim to a chunk of every engineering degree awarded at Princeton No visit back here has ever gone hoagie less and yesterday was no exception I had the large pizza cheese steak damn the cholesterol of which half was wolfed down in minutes and the other half took me dang near the rest of the day to finish Their half 3 80 is the same size as a large at any mortal sub shop while their large 6 50 is the equivalent of a party sub or fence post 
0w6SADnIcM7-KtJD4JLepA Princeton Jeeesh tough crowd These guys butchered the Triumph Not me this place is a little bit of all right It s basically your every day brew pub experience Don t know what i mean OK if your primary goal is to sample all their beers and then some they have a sampler deal which consists of a dozen or so beers in a small portion For me i found them pretty run of the mill home brews nothing special but good One criticism i agree with is slacker staff Man these guys are sampling too much of their own product Food is also nothing extraordinary but not bad 
0WAszex9-SdWuuAqX38TKQ Princeton We go to Chuck s for the wings They are okay I consider them small and dry buy others may use the word crunchy When you don t have many other options you take what you can get 
0wF90JLYC8ygzCpL-zBMTw Princeton Let s start out with an important fact for all its affluence and sophistication Princeton has always been a lousy eating town I don t really know why New Brunswick and Somerville topped it years ago So your choices are surprisingly limited You could do a lot worse then Winberies I used to go fairly often but it had been about a decade since I d been there I was pleasantly surprised The beer list while overpriced is very good Palm Southern Tier Sierra Nevada specialties Founders and more I had a good chicken sandwich which is all you want at times Occasionally I m still chastised for having a chicken sandwich in Rio when I could have had piranha but look it s just a white fish probably like tilapia My cohorts had lobster clubs and turkey clubs The fries were pretty good Service was friendly and fairly efficient I was happy imagine Sisyphus happy That is a solid recommendation 
0X7PSw3UDrpXwWTyj3W1XQ Princeton Slice between is not Old World pizza but really good yeasty crusty dough thin enough to not be doughy thin crispy pepperoni not greasy sausage sliced like gyros not as fennel like as I prefer Fresh mozzarella basil The veggies could have been cooked longer but it was delivered in 21 minutes to our house estimate was 35 minutes The shop is owned by the same people who own Hoagie Heaven George s and caters to the same crowd hungry students It was like good pizza by the slice which is usually reheated for the customer at the counter I think there are chairs a counter in the window but it s a take away place eat on one of the benches outside Denser more heavily topped than Conte s and not as spiced Also not at all like Pizza Star which has good dough but makes Chuck E Cheese like pizza Different from Massimo s Iano s also with good crust but somehow indelible slices of pizza It s not Italian style like at Teresa s or Osteria Procaccini super thin ample sauce light hand on toppings more like NYC style not as good as John s better than any of the Ray s The guy who answered the phone was excited pleasant We ll definitely get it again 25 for a large pizza veggie with pepperoni sausage mushroom delivered before tip paid with a credit card over the phone There were no red bell peppers as stated and it could have used some garlic We also asked for a menu which they forgot but I can pick one up whenever The website is currently useless and only asks for signups but also lacks a menu 
0xjkXrwncJ3JoLbGaDl-zA Princeton hidden gem best pizza i ve ever had in the USA the only downside is that it s a small place and they dont take reservations so i guess sometimes you have to wait 
0XkQ7jw_mfDS9ioZoElOYg Princeton Elements of Asia is def one of my fav restaurants when I am home It is probably the best sushi place in town 
0Xw0PV78eslxtUkxn118vA Princeton 3 5 Good food good beer and friendly Been here twice 
0y7o5CJ8e2RQY2yzibB7fg Princeton Meh That s really all I can say about this place We went here because every review says OMGZ BESTWINGSIVEEVERHADZOMG but they weren t They re pretty standard wings kind of one note We also had a fried clam sandwich which was also pretty unremarkable BUT The place is cheap the service is good and if you re looking for a quick bite to eat this place is right up your alley 
0YdHAc_BvxbMJRrHpAiV2w Princeton Excellent pizza the best in the area I have been going to this pizzeria for almost 20 years and I have yet to find a comparable one within at least 25 miles Its appearance is nothing extraordinary it s just a plain bar with small tables However the pizza itself is extraordinary and the service is very friendly They make a wonderful thin crust pizza with a selection of toppings You can expect a wait during dinner time almost every day but any of the regulars would tell you that it is well worth it I wouldn t pay for any other pizza if I were in the central Jersey area 
0yHAQbqZDmUiGQwxQAjiEw Princeton This is a reasonable dive bar It s most singular feature is that it is within walking distance of Princeton campus The beer is cold and cheap It has a junky but useable pool table If you re looking for these features the Ivy Inn will do the job 
0YUEcScel5_OLqdBQEra4g Princeton I always order delivery from Sultan Wok though I ve never actually been there Here s a few key pointers Takes at least 40 minutes for them to prepare and deliver your order meh Minimum 8 delivery charge 15 for credit cards Cheap lunch menu makes me feel like I hit the lotto They have their own car hehe Crispy noodles are pretty stale disappointing The wontons in the soup are GIGANTIC Holy cannoli They did let me substitute my egg roll for a spring roll I wouldn t get sushi from here it s more unauthentic than normal Pad thai is my favorite here Overall it s pretty darn good 
0z5iFEwhbVyDa-JBrPU2QA Princeton To me there is nothing more fun than trying a new restaurant and since I am a fan of Bobby Flay we had to try this new place which opened recently I am always silently inspecting eating establishments and this one looked nice and clean and I was pleased to see that everyone in the kitchen was wearing a nice head covering We ate at about 4 45 PM and there were plenty of available seats Ordering did not take too long and we both had the turkey burger called the L A Burger The avocado relish was very tasty and fresh and we also enjoyed the watercress which sat atop the burger We shared delicious sweet potato fries and were both very happy The only thing we could have wished for was a nice whole wheat bun That would have been a nice touch The music was raucus and much too loud but at a burger place I guess that is what one must expect All in all we enjoyed the meal and look forward to returning for more nice fresh delicious well cooked food 
0_tUsFe2EbsBp3_gdyobnw Princeton 10 degrees outside and in need of some comfort Asian food I found Shanghai Park in the area of course on yelp While I had learned to eat soupy dumplings a k a pork buns on the English menu since despite my half Chinese background I can t read the Chinese one at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia CA I had extremely high expectations for Shanghai Park s For 5 95 you get an order of 6 dumplings we opted for 2 The sauce that comes with it is similar to that of soy sauce with vinegar and strips of ginger Our buns weren t that hot when it came out and even when you take a small bite of the steam no steam would arise before sipping out the soup slightly disappointing Also ordered their singapore style noodles also lukewarm and the taste was really nothing special I hear that they have dim sum here on weekends too and I ve been looking for a place to have that in close proximity so I m glad to hear that I ve been trekking to edison and nyc Expect an upcoming update review on their dim sum soon 
10DFkUg4PSv2Mq_T0lym6A Princeton Best value for sushi in Princeton This is where I go when I get hit with that sushi craving but don t feel like breaking the bank They have a casual atmosphere with a TV and high tables You can tell that it s a very community oriented place where the owners remember their customers and are always joking around with them I love the sushi here because they are not cheap with the fish Sometimes if they have extra fish they couldn t fit in the roll they will just lay it out on top of the roll for you Their spicy tuna is much better than at other places I ve tried because they fill it with big chunks of tuna like tartare Although their salad bar is nothing fancy read iceberg lettuce the ginger dressing is SO tasty I always have to get a salad when I come here I think you can get a free salad with every two rolls you order 
10sBiSBbFgFNJIpq0tE-bg Princeton Finally a great space location and food in Princeton Been over a year since we went but I recall apps salads were strangely presented and fresh Can t wait to go back Went back in Jan Sat at the bar and had appetizers Configuration of the bar is great for socializing and meeting our neighbors we rarely see 
10V9mmrcQSy2ApC1Bx8Sgg Princeton Gross Overpriced nasty food and generally apathetic service but hey I d be apathetic if I worked there too If you re really into seafood go someplace else 
11CyrZHLNA4WUC0IquRIYg Princeton Eno Terra is clearly attempting to be a fine restaurant in the Manhattan style It has many excellent points including an excellent wine selection but is a bit overpriced and overall falls short of my expectations I ll start with food My wife and I were celebrating and we each ordered three appetizers or appetizer sized entrees putting appetizer sized entrees on the menu is a plus Our overall reaction was inconsistent Her carpaccio and my tuna tartar were both overwhelmed by the pickled vegetables Her local summer vegetable rissotto was her favorite course but note that the veggies were not IN the risotto they were placed on top A small point but important to risotto fanatics The risotto itself was very nicely done not easy to do My stuffed calamari was spicy and a complex mix of flavors but black olive tapenade was a bit too strong in the mix And the calamari was chewy Perhaps this is a preference but when you ve had melt in your mouth calamari it becomes the standard Final course was a squid squid ink pasta for my wife which she liked a lot Mine was the agnolotti with coppa stuffing This was exceptional The pasta is made fresh and is lucious The coppa filling was complex and satisfying Drenched in oil with pea tendrils on top Magnificent Service was not so great To us the first and potentially most important service check off is that our drinks arrive fast and before our first course The food delivery was so fast it felt rushed which suggests the crass American habit of maximizing table turns We asked several times for the wine and it finally arrived was good but I was upset by then This is a wine restaurant And we sat in the wine bar So pairing wine by the glass with a course shouldn t be hard to do But once again the new selection of wine for the 2nd course arrived well after the food Two strikes The wine portions were generous so we didn t each do pairings for the final course The menu emphasizes locally grown and raised food They even have their own farm The waiter was a bit too chatty and not confident in wine recommendations She recommended discussing wine pairings with one of the owners and we said yes but he never showed up She also told us how wonderful everything was which I find to be a negative Let me come to my own conclusions about the food Yes you can make a recommendation if I ask but don t gush about everything The space is very attractive The wine displays are very nice The bar is nice sized and there are hi tops and a variety of tables The space is bright and older people who have trouble in noisy rooms might find the main dining room a bit too bright There are separate menus for the dining rooms and the wine bar NOTE that in the wine bar you can order from EITHER menu but in the dining room you CANNOT order from the more casual wine bar menu Seems arbitrary and capricious to me We were given the dining room menu in the wine bar and had to ASK for the wine bar menu I knew they offered both because I discussed this during a reservation call and have eaten at several NYC restaurants with two rooms and two menus I can t really comment on the quality of the wine I don t really have an experienced or intuitive wine palate But the selection was large and the prices went from reasonable to expensive Come to your own conclusions They offer free valet parking which gives the place a high class or resort feel So overall we felt rushed the food ranged from ok to excellent it was fairly expensive the service was barely ok and they made too many mistakes But it was worth the visit I would recommend it without hesitation if you love wine if you re concerned about value for the dollar do lunch and go if you want some new flavors but are willing to take a risk that they won t work and can t easily get into NYC 
14KGVUgupT1cEsGrg-F9RQ Princeton Teresa s is a fun bistro It has an energy to it maybe its the tight quarters and the college town atmosphere but it is a fun place for dinner The pizza we had was tasty as were the sausage and beef meatballs Many of the dishes are organic vegetables or farm raised animals which is something you don t often see at these prices There is a long wait on weekends so be prepared However there doesn t seem to ever be a wait at the bar if that is an option 
14LntmIq-Q2hwwQ1N_Q-TQ Princeton Best vegetarian selection One of the finest places to socialize and just love the atmosphere and friendly A must and highly recommended Mexican Restuarant 
14YH89qucxXNTtVPXQowXA Princeton They are mostly famed for their plethora of decently prepared lunch items hot cold that seem to be popular for the I want to eat healthier but I don t have the time to cook myself set But as a health food store I find them to be a huge fail It used to be that they were 1 higher on 5 items but now they are up to 1 higher on 2 items not acceptable in my book Add that to often finding expired items on the shelves and in the refrigerated section as well as consistently being given an attitude when using coupons this place is not for me 
14YZEpAXF98wlApoEkVvQA Princeton The food was amazing My wife says it was the best lobster bisque she s ever had better than the soup she got at McCormick and Smicks a few weeks ago The service was fair and that is pulling the rating down Are they not allowed to pour our wine for us at a BYOB never had to pour my own first glass at any restaurant The fish was beautifully grilled and tasted fantastic 
15Nhs15_c-kKRU9f16jJ1g Princeton Came here for the first time for a friend s birthday last week Food was delicious and for 21 95 worth every penny especially because they let you order SASHIMI I feel like a lot of all you can eat sushi places don t have that option Also their rolls were pretty good especially the butterfly roll Also get the ones with mango don t remember what they re called hahh Minus a star because it was cramped and service was pretty awful 
17b9xXAYVJbf0cnykeGHUg Princeton I m a long time fan of Steak Hoagie The Buffalo Chicken Cheese Steak is the best you ll ever have However I have noticed the cooks are starting to skimp on the meat nowadays and the prices are rising In 2001 I would ve given this place Five stars 
18fZxKLjG9bDaKpP9y2EUQ Princeton Located a bit out of the way all the way down Witherspoon close to Princeton Medical Center is this tiny Chinese Malaysian restaurant that surprisingly serves up some of the best Chinese fare in downtown Princeton By best of course in the context of Princeton and its abhorrent lack of good Chinese restaurants I mean good If only Hunan was more centrally located on Nassau St I m sure this place would be buzzing To be honest I think the only reasons why Ivy Garden and Tiger Noodles still exist is because of its proximity to the Equad where the largely international engineering graduate students don t have meal plans and need to find places to eat every day I know this because every day the smell of bad Chinese food wafts through the building around lunchtime I digress Hunan s food is consistently good with few aberrations or atrocities All of the stir fried noodles both on the Chinese and Malaysian menu are pretty decent and I almost always order the eggplant and tofu in special sauce dish But warning Stay away from the pho Even if it s 20 degrees outside and all you want in life is a hot bowl of something True it s only 6 for a giant bowl but it was incredibly bland and slightly offensive in taste The mooshu pork was not my idea to order this was quite salty and the XO sauce that came with it was umm not XO sauce Whatever it was I didn t use it after my first wrap because it just accentuated the saltiness I ve taste tested most of the menu though and in general if you don t try to go for something wacky you ll be alright 
18H17pJeHeIKRHHsU8qg0w Princeton Not sure why this is listed as not being good for kids We took our three little ones for lunch and were surprised delighted to find high chairs and a suitable kids menu The grown up grilled cheese with Brie figs and tomato was delicious We were in from out of town but would definitely go back some day 
18yRidrpNmhBiutvbCLtFA Princeton Went to Elements for lunch to celebrate a birthday They had a fairly simple menu priced at 11 per course very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber From the first bite I could tell the food was prepared with fresher ingredients The roasted beets salad and the fluke were prepared beautifully and tasted even better My wife had the Peterson s burger which looked like a slider on steroids The service was very good the decor is lovely and the ambiance other than the cheesy muzak being piped throughout the restaurant was perfect for an intimate lunch Overall I would rate my experience at Elements between 4 5 and 5 stars so I ll give them the benefit of rounding up For a true foodie not a better lunch choice in the Princeton area 
19CpXVRL0OeQPSj5zl2YyA Princeton It is a Princeton institution and definitely a good place to go when you need something quick to grab I often go when I need to take something back to my desk to eat and don t have a lot of time The food is always good but rarely am I wowed and I always end up spending a lot more than I planned as they are quite pricey Service is always excellent and they will customize your order for you 
19IS2cU3R0lxmIpeHdSbGw Princeton My favorite restaurant in Princeton Their calamari is fantastic It s a really interesting mix of squid golden raisins pine nuts hearts of celery peperoncino and plum tomatoes I was expecting it to be fried I obviously did not take the time to read its menu description more carefully but I was still pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was I had the Conchiglie Balsalmico pasta as my entr e which was just as amazing There s something about the combination of balsamic and cream that just makes your mouth water 
19w7dWpRR6b6rzZ3zOxjRg Princeton The original store is based out of downtown Princeton This one is closer to the suburbs so they increased the price on everything The food is not too bad but you feel a little ripped off at the end 
1aoo6pnViNkJu3LM9r0tdA Princeton I really love Asian Bistro It s great quality food and good for it s price especially because food around Princeton is SO expensive One of the best deals you can get is the 11 99 two halves meal where you can choose two dishes you get appetizers It s a great deal for those who love variety I ended up getting the General Tso s Chicken and drunken noodles both which were delicious My friend got bulgogi so good as usual and japchae The fried eggroll was not as good so I d sugest getting the steamed dumplings Staff is really friendly If you are a student you get 10 If you tweet about them you get a free drink It s a great deal Definitely coming back There s a great variety of food AND ALSO the website looks amazing O_O 
1aoW6LTFftziOUHD_dixJQ Princeton Great service Got to meet the owner and had a great time Would recommend coming to this place 
1bLSJlViF_p8wjzf-s8g1g Princeton Great atmosphere Cozy bar area Great garlic fries 
1BRsn8knF3wCgmdzM7-EbA Princeton The pizza itself is 3 stars but let me explain this scathing review I decided to get a delivery for a pizza during lunch on relatively unbusy day I called in and told them my address The delivery guy had problems finding my address so I called him and tried guiding him through street by street Instead of listening to me he insisted that he would keep following the numbers which were out of order as I kept telling him and hung up on me I called him back trying to reexplain that the numbers on my street are out of order and he yelled at me and said he only had a certain amount of minutes on his cell phone Thirty minutes later no pizza I called back and he eventually found my house and shoved the pizza in my hands and said something like Stupid people don t know where you live I went to Magma Pizza sometime later that week and spoke to the manager who didn t offer any apology or explanation I ll never ever ever go back there again My biggest problems with this situation are 1 If you re a delivery man you should always have communication available with your customers in case of a problem as such You should not yell at your customer and tell them you only have a limited amount of minutes If you cannot use your cell phone to communicate with your customers as a delivery man you should not be delivering food on the go 2 If you re a delivery man you always treat the customer with respect no matter the situation This specific delivery guy needs a lesson in customer service and flat out integrity I wasn t even rude to him and he treated me with such disregard His behavior just shows what kind of an individual he is and that Magma Pizza hires workers with his character is disconcerting 3 The manager did nothing to remedy the situation He did not apologize or explain his employee s actions He virtually ignored us and then went on to put a pizza in the oven The stupid volcano oven Speaking of which it s not even that special And even though their pizza is actually perfectly fine Nomad and Old World and even Red Moon if I m in the mood for a greasier chunkier slice TRUMP Magma any day ALSO THE PIZZA WAS COLD WHEN IT GOT TO MY HOUSE AFTER THAT DEBACLE COLD PIZZA UGH 
1cR4wBtCbqaebqqA6ivfsg Princeton Good but nothing special Inside is very boring out dated I felt like I was in a Knight s of Columbus hall or something Prices are good 
1d6p562lUtXypyl36DGeVQ Princeton Visited April 2009 I stayed at the Nassau Inn across the street from Teresa On a whim because I couldn t really decide on what to eat we went to Teresa s I ordered the Minestrone soup and a cheese pizza pie My boyfriend ordered the pasta integrale EVERYTHING tasted delicious Maybe its just something about Princeton but I love everything about it 
1dc2URY-vxE_IYeHzA9s_A Princeton Great for lunch Had the lump crab cakes with Shitake mushrooms Sauce was extremely good Relative to the quality of food the price is quite reasonable 
1dVm4xzFb2svrpS0jWHjZg Princeton 2 10 a slice but amazing pizza the cheese was great It def has the brick oven pizza feel with the crispy to perfection think crust you can eat without it falling apart and high quality ingredients The people are super nice here too 
1Emgl7fWSkoT6O2J0Q1n7g Princeton Just had dinner there tonight My friend and I were looking for a relatively affordable restaurant for dinner and settled on this since i had hear great things from another friend Great decision We were promptly seated though there was not enough parking in the lot so we had to park in another nearby store s parking lot though the good service ended there Service was extremely slow and our waiter had a bit of an attitude Thankfully the food was so delicious it more than made up for the bad service I ordered the chicken parmesan with fresh pasta from local fave Lucy s ravioli kitchen It was A mazing just what I needed for the night After dinner we also ordered the chocolate bread pudding It was pretty good I can t rave about it as some others on here have but it was satisfying enough I guess the downfall for me personally was that the chocolate was a little too bitter for my taste and the pudding was a little too dry and not moist enough But delicious nonetheless I will definitely be going back 
1F2ooNIHrat5MuwdYaZRHg Princeton Good fries great fried calamari and great place to kick it What I like about the service here is that the waiters aren t pushy or intrusive even on a busy night 
1F8emYyPMYthRt_NbXX9aA Princeton Last night I tried Soonja s for the first time since the early 1990 s when I was in middle school and came here with my parents I hear it s changed owners since then and as far as I can tell they re doing well My two dining companions and I were eating a quick dinner before catching an 8 o clock show at McCarter Theater which might have had something to do with the packed restaurant early on a Wednesday evening Of us three I was the only one who ordered a Korean meal the seafood bim bim bop and I was very pleased with my choice It was a perfect portion the vegetable and seafood were very fresh and the rice was appropriately steaming hot The spicy sauce that came on the side gave it a nice kick as well The service was also friendly and prompt I look forward to returning again before another twenty years passes 
1Fcj-kea352y0B-FR5HCYA Princeton Ah My friends and I had lunch at this place a lot Seriously I always ended up having spicy pork which I think is the best dish they offer I also like their spicy rice cake Since they at least knew that we were regular we usually got extra kimchi they officially charge for extra for free I think I ve enjoyed eating lunch or dinner here Still I am giving only 3 stars because I heard that kitchen is not that clean from people who used to work there I had no problem from that numerous visits so maybe I m too worried 
1fEjXm9jzILRvqskGP5f2w Princeton My boyfriend and I have eaten here many times and their food is very good Last night we had a reservation for 8 00 but were not seated until 8 30 Five minutes later we ordered our appetizer and did not receive any food until 9 15 By that time we were starving and fairly angry as clients to our left and right who had arrived after us were already being served We were the invisible diners completely ignored by the staff Finally I asked what happened and our waiter said The sushi bar is backed up I looked over and found no one sitting there We are in no hurry to return after being treated so shabbily 
1Fh23_ow2ZVwIltZtolfjA Princeton I would give this place a 3 5 IF there was any other decent place around for middle eastern food but none exists So based on what I had tonight for dinner I ll gladly go back I got a shish kebab sandwich which was quite decent and a rice pudding which was delicious like really really good Other menu items were a bit overpriced but no too much Sandwiches are mostly 8 for their large size which was quite big The entree s were in the 15 20 range and the salads are typically 7 I was surprised that I couldn t have my dinner sandwich there as apparently sandwiches are only available for dine in before 4 PM so I had to take out Still good food Warning no discover plan to bring your visa or mastercard 
1fKuh2nxPJvob8Op-k2XqQ Princeton i ordered this for delivery to princeton for an event and the pizza got here 45 minutes late but to be fair princeton is dark and buildings are not labelled other than that the pizza was alright nothing special really it costs 12 18 pie depending on what toppings go on it i think it is little overpriced for what it is 
1FUQZbmlkg0sIN5BAn6qZw Princeton Most importantly this is the best coffee shop pretty much anywhere 1 star because the prices are damn near inane it s like 3 bucks for a cookie But just being in here makes you feel good love it 
1FZZsUfd4OnKop3oauk8Iw Princeton Wow What a sandwich This place rivals Ike s in the Castro district in San Francisco with the crazy ingredient combos and melt in your mouth bread except it s cheaper and decidedly more spacious I opted for the Mac Daddy and thanks to other Yelpers only ordered the half size Just enough to leave me full without feeling disgusting Yeah This place isn t for you if you re counting points watching your waist or minding your calories But DAMN it s a nice indulgence Next time I m in Princeton I ll definitely be back 
1G9wWVQx85Veuhif_yggLg Princeton I don t know who said this was like NY pizza Uh no way It was bland and tasteless They use fresh mozzarella slices which is great if you want gourmet pizza but it doesn t give you the real cheese to sauce ratio that a great pizza offers We ordered a whole large pizza so it was made to order But sadly it was very disappointing Also they ONLY take cash What s the deal Princeton Very tiny place with seating for three and a surly manager whose unhappiness comes out in the pizza I say pass I found a better though seemingly highly unlikely place a week later called Candela II in a little strip mall behind Quaker Bridge Road It s in the same place as the Dunkin Donuts This was NYC pizza 
1Grg2sYtNm4OuQLegGew_g Princeton It is what it is If you like this kind of place you ll love the Ivy If you don t you won t like it 1000 better since the NJ smoking ban I would really give this place a 4 but I m giving it a 5 to counteract the moron who rated the bar badly because he was dumb enough to drink and drive The very nice bartenders will gladly call you a cab I m sure 
1Gwa1-wm6FB3ZoZgR3COnQ Princeton Awesome food The reasons why I am not giving this 5 stars is due to its service Waited 45 minutes for our spring rolls but once the food came wow 
1h1NEqYav3eiOpKxlsW_Pg Princeton Triumph is a lot of fun The beer is really good they have an IPA I m in love with and lots of other brews to fit every taste The food is good the beer is better Though they do have a hanger steak entree that I really do like a lot But definitely the best beer in Princeton 
1h2KsMowNW_B0hMHZjsWGw Princeton This place is chock full of incredibly delicious things Almost everything I ve tried here from the tilapia to the pasta to the vegetable sides to the desserts has been delicious Even very simple dishes like pasta with olive oil and garbanzo beans is delicate flavorful and perfectly textured In the fridge at the back of the shop are ready to go takeout items including salads sandwiches pasta fruit and desserts There is a selection of homemade pasta and sauces And then two cases filled with meats pasta salads lasagna veggies and side dishes For selection and flavor I d give it five stars I m taking off one because it s pricey It s hard to go in within spending at least 20 30 This is a great place to pick up a ready made meal when you don t have time or to stock up for a picnic 
1HR4wDIPGg_bv038FA7T7Q Princeton We went to this place as this waitress standing outside was offering free croquettes to us and my hubby was in this mood to try a different cusine We saw the menu outside and it looked good and every item was around 10 15 But what we missed was that it was the lunch menu and for dinner the prices are much higher We went and saw that each dish was over 22 25 We weren t ready to shell out so much for some restaurant that didn t even look that fancy so we just ordered a salad and a dish called 4 cheese crepes SO we don t know what the waitress understood she brought 4 pieces of that item We were 4 of us We were in no mood to pay around 100 bucks So we explained to waitress what happened So the waitress goes and talks to the chef and a bunch of 3 or 4 people are looking at us and whispering some crap We were totally embarrassed Had they been a little understanding and gracious we would have taken the order But their behavior totally irked us off and we are never ever going to this place again They crepes tasted good though 
1I0z7LHziwxeW7YQMXO5pQ Princeton What a waste of a great location Poorly prepared low quality food served by people who couldn t care less Is it that difficult to cook a decent hamburger Why does the menu say home cooked turkey when the stuff on my salad is that shiny gelatinous factory made garbage The entire Nassau Inn experience is incompetent The owners need to get out more The place looks and feels like it s run by people who have been shut in since 1972 
1i9wvVyJn9BTK-8eqwuBOQ Princeton A really lovely place Eating alone is never the most fun but here they have communal tables or you can eat at the bar The initial service wasnt great but the waiter made up for it and I had a really enjoyable evening thumbs up from me 
1IpdCsmeuF-XFVJnf1lL5Q Princeton Their stuff is USUALLY good and service fast but I wouldn t ever eat there again My girlfriend and I both got food poisoning from their gyros I had one and put the other in the fridge 12 hours later I was sick Girlfriend didn t believe me it was the gyro ate the other one and 12 hours later same thing While it used to be my absolute favorite take out place in town George s isn t worth the risk of spending another three days unable to keep food or water down hovering over the toilet 
1itpUF7skIb7US-X6codfw Princeton A fun friendly bar right across the street from campus with decent burgers great Wed wine nights and inexpensive happy hour specials The food isn t amazing but it is good for the area and the service is usually decent if it isn t overy crowded which it will get on weekends Definitely worth stopping by if you re in Princeton and want a diverse selection of drinks accompanied by good food of either the lounge or sit down type 
1jDG17wH1SzlAVr5YXLPcw Princeton We went here for New Year s Eve dinner with our in laws and had a fantastic meal I loved the rustic decor from the start and the wine list was very good good selection of domestic and international wines I loved the Jersey Greens salad with local ingredients The venison was good but the vegetables with it were exceptional The braised pork farrotto was also great I will go back in a heartbeat 
1jlQcwQAIXv3x2bKuwj_bw Princeton I recently attended an event where we were served exceptionally good bread When I asked where it was from I was told the Main Street Bakery So though I had passed this place many times I finally made a point of stopping there Yum The bakery selection is amazing and everything I tried was delicious Cookies a raspberry almond bar mini chocolate bunt cakes salads There is also a nice selection of sandwiches soups and kids entrees with some items ready to go in the case Best of all the prices are very reasonable and service is friendly In nice weather there are a few tables outside This is a place I will be returning to for breakfasts lunches and baked goods 
1Jo7FbL_yiPn0UuFu8VtxQ Princeton Line took 20 mins even though we arrived at 11 45am Grilled cheese had no flavor They dont have a veggi burger on the menu The chipotle and BBP sauces were awful Don t think I ll be going back 
1J_eGG_WzdJPtnNTX2Pvrw Princeton Blue Point Grill has a great atmosphere it really feels like we re at the beach The clam chowder is AMAZING My daughter loves to eat the crunchy oyster crackers that have the slightest hint of saltwater My husband likes both the fried and grilled calamari My son has found interest in the lobsters in the aquarium He also stuffs his pockets with the colorful mints A great family seafood restaurant 
1K5Z0pv-Q2_ZRrlNmVBJPw Princeton Great place to get a sandwich Not for the health conscious Many of the special sandwiches have names that deal with health problems the Heart Stop the Body Bag and the Block just to name a few The bread they use is outstanding and they are not stingy with the sauces I made a special stop with some friends when driving down route 1 and they all agreed that it was the best sandwich they ever had If you go late night be aware that the grill will be turned off exactly at closing time no matter how long you have been there but they will make cold sandwiches until the line is gone 
1KivPHaLo3rtySpQf5bQkQ Princeton I thought the shrimp and portabella salad was tasty mixed greens plenty of portabella pieces roasted red peppers black olives and onions mixed with oil and vinegar Could have used a few more shrimp only had 3 4 and less oil but overall I was satisfied It was a little pricey compared to other options 12 but I wasn t in the mood for pizza pasta or panini Fries with my bf s panini were just ok plain and slightly mushy We stopped off of rt 206 in Princeton in search of a non fast food meal after a long drive from NY and ended up here Could have made a worse choice and certainly beat BK or McDonalds 
1Kk5D8sE6fCw-Bd6N8Po7Q Princeton ONION RINGS ARE THE BOMB HERE And so are the cheap drinks 
1KQnad0sLzmdrsgzex9krw Princeton I am downgrading my rating again after coming here today This place has really gone downhill compared to what it was like a year ago They now only give 2 naans and they aren t even fresh anymore Just dry nasty naan An indian buffet that doesn t always give fresh naan is horrible and really indicative of how poor their business is doing The food quality was still okay but the naan really made me regret coming here This place is now the worst out of the 4 indian buffets in Princeton Palace of India doesn t serve fresh naan but at least their delicious tandoori chicken makes up for it Tandoori Bite is by far the best followed by Mehek which is slightly above Palace of India Definitely stay away from this place 
1mZjVB1U2DPjWlOh2-Zn4g Princeton If you have never been to a Hooters then you just don t get it When we arrived this Hooters was located inside a shopping center and wasn t that busy We were greeted by many females with their Hooters popping out I like the idea that we get to pick where we want to sit I don t like the idea that we don t get to pick what girl serves us Our waitress fit the blonde stereotype perfectly You expect to have a good time at Hooters and she didn t bring her A game She also forgot a part of our order I wasn t impressed by her skills or her Hooters The food at Hooters is typical bar food After you eat here you can easily fall into a food coma I did love the buffalo shrimp so much that I had to order another round The loaded tots are good to share and you need to eat then with a fork I do love the fact that you have a roll of paper towels at the table The beer here is alright Our Hooters girl poured us glasses from our pitcher My glass was served with a crack in it This is a huge safety and health hazard The bathroom in the Hooters of Princeton is the dirtiest and most disgusting restaurant bathroom I have ever been in There was even poo on the toilet seat I would definitely try to find another Hooters to visit if you want to see Hooters 
1n-OvM_eRgJy8_goUFJ-mw Princeton This time I had the veggieburger sans sauce It was delicious crisp spicy and firm with fresh lettuce summer tomatoes and hot hot onions that made my nostrils burn I m gonna do that again soon The fries were pretty good too but I left half of them on the plate cause there were too many to be reasonable Also coffee was hot and Samara was incredibly attentive You win PJ s 
1N27iTI3jO_2V5yQIxvhFg Princeton Romeos added a nice outdoor seating area a couple of years ago which is probably its best feature The food in the restaurant section is pretty typical suburban italian fare I m not sure why an Italian restaurant that seems to be run by actual Italian people makes food that seems so dull maybe it s the market they are in Plainsboro isn t exactly Little Italy The pizza side of the restaurant is a little better but still just about average Oh well if you are hungry go to Romeos just don t expect too much 
1n2ZXT6DhGC6-G9ct1syew Princeton I rarely find myself at P F Chang s mainly because I try to eat at more indie spots but every time I find myself dining at one I am always very happy and this location was no exception The wonton soup was stellar I could see heading in for just that and some Sapporo and calling it a day we also had lettuce wraps which were really good but they always are and mongolian beef I am not gonna lie I have had better Mongolian beef but all in all I was a big fan the service was prompt the beer was cold and the food was delish If I am ever in the neighborhood again I would stop back in for sure 
1NzBjnRw5g6hxkKfox5jEA Princeton Good if you re in a pinch and in the area and browsing picking out goodies is fun but I wouldn t go out of my way to come here About 750 difference places to pay and only certain items can be paid for at certain registers so the whole experience is kind of long winded and confusing Very visually appealing setup and worth checking out at your leisure 
1ODk_O5GvZTjqs9LcRoVtw Princeton The Sushi here was decent Not the best I have ever had but for the area it is very good I went during the off time between lunch and dinner and therefore didn t have to wait I tried many different rolls and the ones that stood out were the Stacey Roll which I have had before at Kenji Fusion and the Salmon Skin because I have never had any Roll like it before The Stacey mostly because of it s sauce can stack up to Rolls at any Sushi spot But I found everything to be just good The price was reasonable The Decor is very modern and gives the place an upscale feel even though there are some dings and scrapes on the walls I have only tried the Sushi so I can t speak to the other dishes If there was a rating for 2 5 stars I would probably give it that 
1ODX-YUVN-UP53XOusf77A Princeton The falafel sandwiches here are off the wall It s a beautiful grab it and go store with tons of variety I also really dig the wide sampling of interesting drinks and sodas available Absolutely perfect for a quick lunch or picnic takeout 
1OQdaznkYrIbr-qR3VAvgA Princeton First time there thought to myself Hope this isn t a bad decision It wasn t however I ordered the pla lard prik white fish lightly fried with coconut chili sauce Very good but not as spicy as I would have liked The service was fast the bill cheap and the water glass full constantly I can see why some reviews are negative but I enjoyed my meal thoroughly 4 stars for great service and solid food 
1OuBl8RODxbxdKSZ0XvX9g Princeton can go toe to toe with anyplace I ve dined at in NYC and for us a neighborhood place which really treats you like it never had a bad dish wine list and cocktails are excellent and extensive Jeff is a miracle for wine selections and hosts tastings too 
1p6o167uNS5cwE35lqqLiA Princeton We love the quality taste and price Only drawback is no indoor seating 
1Q-4sSlEj4adEKybD70kQA Princeton Love this place very tasty entrees good salads and an excellent choice of good wines The pizza and wine tasting on Mondays is a treat Wait staff is well informed and pleasant 
1qEm7NiqRjm3ok4Z7A2D-Q Princeton are you guys all mental THIS PLACE SUCKS a few years ago my brother told me we should go eat there because it was really good and has a lot of food at least the second part of that was true my brother and i BOTH got diarrhea before we even left the joint uh oh it is way worse quality than any mcdonald s white castle wendy s etc everything is soooo greasy and the desserts make me want to vomit they had some cloudy white jell o cubes that looked suspicious they were also serving chicken feet i have to admit i tried them bad idea jeans yeah they have a great selection of horrible oily garbage maybe i should try the american food but like at that point why even go to a chinese buffet i agree with the person who said that it was hilarious but the food is definitely so so so bad 
1QfK4bSwsJ1TAxBelMIoXg Princeton I am an easy customer to please I overtip I don t ask for things made special for me I ve done the job so I empathize with those serving me That said my experience here was unfortunate Ordered the Epic Burger it wasn t epic Small with a poor choice of bun and accompanied by I kid you not about 20 fries We sat at the bar and I m sorry to say the bartender had no redeeming qualities You don t have to chat me up just be somewhat friendly pay attention to empty beer glasses in a reasonable amount of time The beer was decent 
1Qsv-viCLe35xDd8KBxxFQ Princeton The hoagies at Hoagie Haven are the best You don t have to travel to Philly for the perfect hoagie when you have this awesome place in Princeton NJ The hoagie roll they use for their hoagies and hot sandwiches are amazing It is so soft the texture is perfect It s all about the roll and Hoagie Haven is right on the mark They are also very generous with the amount of meat and toppings they put into their sandwiches Their hoagies are not for the faint at heart so be prepared to have your cholesterol checked before you visit this place This is the best sandwich shop in Princeton and probably in NJ They have a huge menu of hoagie subs and hot subs similar to the ones you will see in the grease trucks at Rutgers University These grease hoagies are also popular at Hoagie Haven The lines are long so be prepared to wait but they also close late if your looking for a midnight snack My favorite hoagies are their classic italian hoagie and they have the BEST eggplant parmesan hoagie as well 
1QUbA8MSqr_1i_KTSuciCg Princeton Make sure you don t order the peasant omlette unless you want potatoes with your potatoes you get more sausage in a jimmie dean sandwich and that won t cost you 9 bucks not worth it I really wanted a better experience since I like to support local business but this is not up to par for my standards especially with the price tag 
1QVgDWl9WTr2fgf6wTrIUA Princeton My wife and I went here for lunch We enjoyed the experience and the food While there is a glut of Japanese restaurants in Princeton including Sakura Express Moc Moc Tomo sushi and others the only legitimately Japanese restaurant is Ajihei whose owner is Japanese and worked as a chef for a pricey Manhattan place That being said my wife and I thought this was one of the best places we have been to The atmosphere is cookie cutter tatami fixtures but they accent the place well and give it a peaceful feel The food is generally served in bentou style lunch box settings more elaborate combos including tsukemono traditional sides or yakitori skewers The food is capable for the price I am not sure what Lu Y means by claiming the curry is terrible It s standard Japanese curry They are capable of making a Chicken Katsu correctly unlike Sakura Express or Tomo Sushi 11 as a bento with curry fish and spring rolls a simple salad and miso soup and my wife enjoyed her pick 3 for 12 lunch combo also including the soup and salad 
1rhrmKk6MB_vO_NIU2B09g Princeton Service can be very slow and inattentive The wait for a table can get fairly long as well Atmosphere nothing very special here Clean and neat Price much too high considering the quality of the food and service 20 40 or higher per person Food hit or miss some things are amazing others are sub par 
1rxn8_fmFrKRdzhICeVHHA Princeton Maybe I had too high of an expectation after reading some of the reviews The food is okay but nothing special 
1SlexGDknZA4_rpt7wDCyQ Princeton I don t think this place needs reviews since it was beyond capacity on Saturday nights If you ve ever tried the efes in new Brunswick this is very similar and that s a good thing for those who haven t had the other place Very surprised by the first review Granted service wasn t excellent but that s not their forte their food however should have compensated I would suggest he take another attempt their food is very nice and one of the very few turkish places in a 20 mile radius I also suggest people try Istanbul Cafe in North Brunswick We always order an appetizer platter at every mediterranean spot and a chicken kebab platter Here we enjoyed all the appetizers and a solid 4 Marinated and juicy chicken very well done about 15 minutes waiting The combo platter is good if you like meat since thats the focus but note the gyro meat is delicious Definitely stop by for either sandwiches pick up and go though For those eating platters have it nice and warm 
1sopjD7FbDXxgtVEq7EyRw Princeton I don t really understand the hype I have no problem with Small World except the crowds if you like a crowded atmosphere you might really love it here It s just not my scene They make a splendid spicy chai that will clear out your sinuses it s great 
1TChI1tU3QSITdd69VT29Q Princeton Taste of Mexico offers good unpretentious Mexican food prepared from scratch in front of you at decent prices The ambiance sucks the restaurant is in a strip mall with four tables and bar seating with a few outside tables when weather permits but the food is solid enough that we keep going back Due to limited space some things like the chips and salsa are clearly off the shelf although the entrees are all freshly prepared In particular the tacos al pastor are really good as are the enchiladas Don t be afraid to ask if you want your food spicier as the default is somewhat mild 
1tr1-Msr0F7JdrvTaknoIw Princeton So I met a few friends and had lunch here It s not a place I would typically eat 1 cause I m a vegetarian with the exception of fish every once in a while and 2 cause I m not a huge fan of BBQ taskting food aka steak house food but that is where they wanted to go so we did I had the fish special which was very good pricy yes but good I know this might sound weird but I love the decor of the bathrooms I know people don t go to a place based on what the bathroom looks like but I needed to say it The bathrooms are gorgous Dark wood and earthy tile LOVE IT Anyway so my friends love the food there and eveyone seems to like it so based on that and on what I had to eat I give it a 3 and 4 for ambiance and decor But keep in mind if you aren t a big meat eater like myself you don t really have much options except for like one or two things 
1tvxbB2153gQQR6fvfPukA Princeton Great thin crust pizza We went with sausage and red peppers and another with pepperoni Generous with the toppings and great flavors Sausage was a little spicy and had a kick You order first then get some drinks at the bar you sit when your pizza is ready Old school building but delicious pizza will deff be back 
1U-7QWepf5etf-R0othe1g Princeton Phenomenal meal here last week with a business associate The place was bustling the food was phenomenal the service was superb I loved this place and I can t wait to get back to that neighborhood to eat here again the food was VERY VERY VERY good 
1uNaOE7h9dhcSz27GaOZuA Princeton The hands down BEST vegetarian food I have ever eaten I got the curry supreme the first and only time I ve eaten there so far but had a taste of my dad s sweet and sour sensation and both dishes were to die for Most of the main dishes come with either taro spring rolls vegetable spring rolls with a softer shell than usual and brown and red rice both of which I had never tried before but they were a nice complement to my meal Hopefully next time I m in Princeton I can eat there again Thank you Zen Palate for expanding MY palate 
1vbTKrWbl6jfbiVsuohNyQ Princeton Omg i don t know if it was my selection of food that i chose but this was the worst chinese food I d ever had in my life My stomach aches at the thought of it I almost had to force it down 
1vOGG_riiCu_Te1OLPe4Mg Princeton I go to Small World everyday for an expresso based drink so I can t comment on the drip coffee Lattes and cappuccinos are fantastic and usually have plenty of rich coffee flavor The drinks are fairly consistent even with different baristas The staff are friendly and make drinks quickly and there is free wifi Almost always busy short wait though so I m not the only one who loves this place 
1vSWnsNFxnsssvCfKmaT_w Princeton The staff couldn t be any nicer and they have the most impressive selection of chips of any deli I ve ever visited but the thing that makes them really great They carry Lightlife Smart Deli vegan slices in ham and turkey Get a combo throw in a bag of Wise Onion Rings 
1VW3mxBpXqc6x4zrFK0woQ Princeton The bar offers a club like atmosphere and the big horseshoe bar sits in front of a large Normal Rockwell attributed it s unsigned painting of Yankee Doodle that s fun to enjoy while having a pint on a Saturday Afternoon Princeton is not a town of super great bars and this the A B and Triumph make the borough s first tier Reasonably priced never noisy or overly crowded it s a great place to go with a few friends The food here is pretty good a big step above pub stuff The composed salads are particularly nice 
1W4ciYghmIlgwUNA0ssP_g Princeton I had Sunday brunch here with my family The atmosphere is charming especially around the holidays if you like that ye old pub kind of stuff which I do It s tastefully decorated and cozy and the staff is very nice The food here is OK and my impression is that they are going for the gastro pub trend but it s more American B B hotel fare than English foodie style food The bread basket had too many overly sweet things and not enough savories and my Paris Brest Salmon with eggs was just ok What I would definitely recommend The eggnog New to the menu it is rich frothy and strong They make it with peanut butter which I found very interesting you can t taste it but the richness is there I think this place has a lot of potential but they need to decide which direction to go on the food Either keep it pricey as it is now and turn it up a few notches or make it cheap and cheerful I m not sure that I d go back for a full meal but I would definitely stop by in the evening for a pint and an appetizer 
1WHA0CqT8KX_AB9eCLWuJg Princeton Hoagie Haven is a Princeton institution Cheap delicious fast and greasy food Whether it s noon and you re sober or midnight and you re drunk Hoagie Haven is delicious I highly recommend the cheese fries or buffalo cheese fries buffalo fries or honey mustard cheese fries or any of the fat sandwiches George s next door usually does better hot sandwiches though better quality chicken at least so if you are going during the day it might be worth checking George s out instead Otherwise they have the same owners and make basically the same food 
1WJb78rjsqYFDzNWWqQc0g Princeton This is one of my favorite places in the Princeton area The outdoor Cabana is my favorite place to hangout being the only outdoor bar in the area for one but on top of that great frozen drinks and the food always consistent and delicious Try the mussels or the seared tuna i mean really I have enjoyed everything I have ordered The ambiance is very chill and relax so great for hanging out with friends I would definitely recommend Main Street Bistro to anyone looking for good food and ambiance The staff is extremely friendly and accomodating as well Never had a bad experience here 
1WJzCJ4BEi6zsd5GSiyVfw Princeton My girlfriend had the m nage trois vegetable entree The fried tofu and stuffed pepper were good I had the grilled shrimp salad Good flavor but for a entree salad it was a bit small Plenty of shrimp and other items could have used some more lettuce We sat outside in the patio ish area but the plastic sides were closed because of wet weather A bit humid and warm but understandable since it was not a real room Barely waited two minutes for a table on a late August Friday night at about 7pm Nice wait staff albeit a bit spread thin Nice touch having Hershey s Kisses instead of mints on the way out Would have been 3 5 stars if Yelp let me but I ll round up for this one 
1x7RoP8Xy5vR0EOwetsuiw Princeton I recently joined a number of my work colleagues for lunch at nearby Ganges Generally I have a pretty poor opinion of Indian restaurants in the area The food usually is pretty underwhelming bland and appears to be put together by non chefs cooks who know the ingredients but really can t cook well they can do just enough to get by I will say that my standards for Indian food are extremely high since both my wife I can really cook good Indian food We had about 8 of us going to lunch Kedar Danielle and I left the office on time and waited and waited and waited for the others to turn up Turns out Bill kept everyone waiting I would have just left him behind Anyway onto the food We did the buffet which is the typical Indian lunch thing The assortment wasn t great They had the typical chicken tikka masala which seemed watered down a few vegetable dishes tandoori chicken usually the worst thing to eat in a buffet and Ganges did not disappoint There weren t any lamb dishes what the heck They did have masala dosa if requested which we obviously did But it took them forever to bring out the right chutney I was done with my dosa by the time it came out Dessert was way too sweet as is usual with Indian desserts We ordered the chai which was excessively milky and short on spices The others seemed to like this place somewhat more than I did All I have to say is either they don t know Indian food or their standards leave a lot to be desired I for one will not return www foodielifestyle com 
1Xc1QGvW64v8jFrnYTlPJA Princeton If I was rating this place solely on dessert I d give it a 4 The key lime pie was phenomenal and the peach raspberry cobbler great But alas I m not rating it only on dessert I had the Gaucho Steak which comes with corn cakes and sauteed onions The steak was tasty but the portion was small Most of my plate was taken up by three corn cakes and a ton of onions The corn cakes were literally corn and batter that was fried into a pseudo pancake They were extremely bland The tiny amount of steak I was given for 18 was good The only reason I m giving a 3 instead of a 2 is the sole appetizer I had that was great Their Korean Short Rib BBQ sliders were awesome No complaints there That bumps them back up to 3 status in the hope that perhaps some of their other menu items are better 
1XNjbKts-Tzw2DmSHw9sIA Princeton I ve had better It was edible but I wasn t really enjoying my food here 
1YB-1gzVPQw9ecPg4fa2KQ Princeton After picking up a water heater in Whiting we were hungry Ganges was en route had a few new reviews and Indian food sounded good Very friendly service It was a bit chilly near the A C so our server turned it down I left my sweater in the car Jim ordered a lassi which was tangy and not overly sweet We were off to a good start The Chicken 65 was interesting and good bright red pieces of chewy but tender chicken with mild to medium hot pan fried green chiles and crispy curry leaves Not very spicy but good We are not sure which poori we ordered or received What we got were crispy 2 puffs filled with chickpeas and onion topped with crunchy noodles and a sweet and tangy yogurt tamarind sauce which we scooped up it tasted like apricot and honey over a super tangy yogurt This may have been Dahi Sev Poori with chickpeas instead of potatoes Then our usual lamb saag though with a side of roti instead of naan There is heat in this one it builds up nicely 50 of the dish was lamb and it was not as tender as some places a knife was needed but the flavour was very good We overate picking at it for another 10 minutes after telling one another we were more than full The rice was good neither dry and crumbly nor mushy The spicy mint sauce was excellent nearly as good as Taj Mahal s in Brooklyn Including tax but not tip 33 with a full set of leftovers The service is very attentive but not in your face The server s will come by when you appear cold you don t have to call them over When the plates need changing someone will show up Ditto for water We didn t have to ask for anything Even perusing the menus we took our time and once we decided we were ready the server showed up This is awesome There are also Indian styled Chinese dishes served here which have gotten press recently and intrigue me They re also open past 9PM Yeah Open Tue Thu 11 30am 3pm 5 30pm 10pm Fri 11 30am 3pm 5 30pm 10 30pm Sat 11 30am 3 30pm 5 30pm 10 30pm 
1yNzvZkV-51fgmAVEwmskw Princeton This place is pretty much a middle of the road neighborhood favorite It s a nice go to if you really have no other choices or ideas on where to eat drink since princeton is lacking in the latter The menu is american favorites and nothing extraordinary but nothing particularly bad the bar is ok small and cramped though when crowded One time me and my friends wanted to get drinks and one of our group wanted to eat so we were seated in the dining area But since three of us weren t eating they kicked us out into the bar area where my friend had to eat her bowl of chili holding it while perched on a bar stool It was pretty ridiculous so it s deterred me from bringing a mix group of people ie people who have eaten and want a drink along with people who just want to drink it s either or They have an excellent sunday brunch however 
1Ys8c815E-opWSuYdXzQyg Princeton I didn t know what to expect when I walked into ONE 53 for dinner I had read very little about the restaurant online and didn t do my normal drool ritual while looking at the menu Overall the dinner was a pleasant surprise The appetizers were fresh and prepared well letting the ingredients themselves shine on the dish The clams were fresh and the sauce they sat in complimented them well but wasn t overly complex The beet salad was fresh and simply prepared The entrees were similar in design simple and straight forward with no fancy sauces to mask the meats I chose the chicken milanese which was lightly breaded not too oily and a controlled enough cook to keep the moistness in the chicken A fresh tomato salsa esque sauce accompanied it The chef s preparation was smart letting the breadcrumbs and capers in the tomato salsa provide the right amount of salt The other diners I was with got the burger which was cooked with just as much care The standout component on the dish was the truffle mayo aioli Silly to love a sauce but this is worth sticking in your purse and bringing it home with you Overall ONE 53 is a great place that pays a lot of attention to its dishes the meats sauces and components on it Every addition on the plate is purposeful and meant to add a taste or texture to the plate which is how plates should be made 
1yxx-2hJLYy6zE45t3CtRw Princeton Great Food I love the udon the combo plates and the sushi rolls They are always very busy and are very fresh Food is a good portion too on the combo plates They deliver pretty fast as well if you can t make it out to them This place is a win in my book Great spot for lunch or a great home delivery place for folks in the area 
1ZVs3pBkB57AtdzfE1yNiQ Princeton Thought I d give them another try at my sister s urging so I reluctantly agreed The place was packed and we had to wait about 40 minutes for our pizza We ordered a mushroom and onion pie and when it came to the table it was well done burnt When I made a comment to the waitress she got all snotty and told us that s what we asked for We did not I would never ask for my pizza to be well done only a fool would The edges of the pizza were actually black She then again with an attitude told us they d make us another pizza but we d have to wait another 40 minutes I said no because number one we did not want to wait and number 2 I knew that that the guy making the pizza would slap his Johnson on the dough and spit a juicy honker into the sauce I asked for my money back and got it I left a nickle for the half drank soda s and a condom on the table as a tip I would never want that waitress to breed As far as I am concerned I d die of starvation before ever coming back to this red neck dump We ended up getting a great hoagie at a hoagie shop in Princeton I can see by their overall rating of 3 5 that I am not the only one complaining and they ARE NOT the excellent place they once were And to the clown who said this is not a pizzeria and is a pizza joint is full of it Some of the best pizzas in NJ are to be had in Taverns 
1_CTHSMIC70pgSTdpcIKcQ Princeton From the outside Sushi Palace looks like the kind of place where the food should kill you The stripmall ambiance does NOT inspire a lot of confidence but having eaten here 4 5 times I have found that I really enjoy the food I definitely agree with some of the other reviews that the sushi isn t of the highest quality even though it s always fresh and safe For example the texture of the tuna roll is weird because the tuna is shredded and kind of pulpy rather than a solid block of meat However the sashimi and fried rolls are good and they have some really tasty and creative rolls that feature mango and avocado Moreover you can always just pig out on seaweed salad miso soup shrimp tempura edamame and pork shu mai like we do the sushi is almost an afterthought sometimes 
1_pjvYL-0eDq9jN0d2uR4Q Princeton Nice atmosphere quick and friendly service The food is a bit overpriced but it s nice for a happy hour 
1_zI7ZxDM5ikb_un-PQm1A Princeton Most of the stuff comes with salad bar so you don t need to order an appetizer just to stave off any intense hunger We realized this too late While the salad bar is somewhat limited you can make something decent and they have pre made salads potato salad apple salad etc The dressings aren t labeled either This is pretty much what you d expected for a mid range restaurant chain it does the job of feeding you but the food isn t majorly impressive in any way Chicken tenders 5 pieces Ketchup Couple pieces of lettuce Not much more Just as good as any fast food chain Chicken cajun gumbo heavy oily The sausage is funny tasting The shrimp overcooked A fairly large quantity of food Salsa Guac the guac is a little homogeneous not enough of that chunky avocado The salsa is too chunky simple tasteless basically diced tomato onion cilantro etc Not like a dip at all Free cheesy bread balls these were actually pretty good The bread had a decent crisp to it warm and soft on the inside good savory flavor Artichoke dip a little heavy a little salty Lava cake not super impressive The cake was a little dry 
20kLF7Fi0js45_CxcVQhhw Princeton We ordered Spicy Maki Combo and a Nabeyaki Udon The blandest Nabeyaki I ve ever tasted Whoever cooked this soup obviously read the description somewhere and tried to throw it together out of their not even following some kind of basic recipe instructions It was so awkwardly made and just completely wrong that I ve erased the memory out of my mind It was closer to a chinese hot pot with cabbage and noodles and no additional flavoring They had no clue what is Shichimi Nanami Togarashi or have anything similar to it to flavor the soup and make it less gross I felt taken advantage of Spicy Maki Combo was slightly below average compared to sushi around the area considering the sushi in the area isn t very good though there are a few shining exceptions Urban trash sushi with princeton prices not sure how this place will stay in business 
20oBZ45yo0wa0w9TJMNF7w Princeton Sushi is good Insults are free cash register at Sakura Express I think many people now consider Sakura Express an institution of Princeton as it is known for its bargain sushi and its owners who love to tell dirty jokes on you It s true that there are a lot of regulars who love Sakura but the number of university students who frequent Sakura has nosedived since last year Prices magically went up 30 50 over the summer and for many of us who walked into Sakura the first day back on campus ready for some good grub we were quite simply hit by sticker shock My friends walked out after seeing the new prices unable to comprehend such madness I suppose most would still consider Sakura a bargain but I long for the days when I could get 3 rolls for 12 now 16 a gyu don for 5 50 now 8 50 and a salmon teriyaki for 6 50 now 10 00 The food is and always has been generous but that is not to say the quality is good If you want quality go to Ajihei I still don t advocate Ichiban under any budget circumstance But for a budget sushi meal I infinitely prefer Teriyaki Boy The rolls at Sakura are messy with rice bursting out of its seams Moreover the pickled radishes I had at the salad bar today tasted like they had gone bad or been marinated in alcohol I love that stuff and I had to throw them all out How do you f up pickled vegetables Teriyaki Boy offers better made rolls and unlike Sakura prices haven t changed in the past 5 years Side note I would avoid kitchen entrees at T Boy though I suppose Sakura will continue to thrive despite the hike in prices since patrons are usually well to do residents supplemented by new waves of unknowing freshman Eventually old farts like me will graduate and nobody will remember the good ol days so I will immortalize it in Yelp 
239sJ63H0Lc2pmlF6hq9WQ Princeton Amazing Indian food Best spinach dal and dahi sev poori that I ve ever had My husband had a lamb dish that he immensely enjoyed The naan was also excellent I know it s just naan but I ve had bad naan before 
23A0Kc7CQtPx_o2faENIoA Princeton Went there for lunch for our anniversary It was WAY overpriced and worse yet I walked out hungry due to puny serving sizes I ordered the deckel for 26 the best part of a rib eye steak What came out were three tiny pieces of meat each the size of my thumb FOR 26 I complained to the waiter and the manager came over to offer something additional Nice gesture but what is this let s make a deal Besides I am a firm believer in restaurants especially high end ones putting their best foot forward So they wound up NOT bringing me any sides on the house nor even trying to make it up to us with a dessert on the house we ordered and paid for two desserts Besides the taste of the food was only ok Instead I suggest saving money having equally fine cuisine AND leaving on a full stomach by visiting Eno Terra in Princteon Kingston 
23xjJHSW5ENwZ8j4wboSmg Princeton This place isn t much to look at so get your food to go That being said the food is amazing One of the best cheesesteaks I ve ever had and probably the 2nd best from NJ White House in Atlantic City would be 1 The prices are more than fair and the portion sizes are huge An order of fries easily feeds 2 people Next time though I ll skip the extra peppers and onions on my cheesesteak Wasn t really worth the extra couple of bucks since I barely noticed them 
24wsea35vu7hs9WmKmOt8w Princeton I heart Teresa s It is one of the few restaurants in Princeton that is casual fun classy and AFFORDABLE all at the same time And it s absolutely delish Whenever I want to have a nice dinner out without breaking the bank my friends and I inevitably gravitate towards Teresa s charming friendly and totally delicious pastas pizzas They have two kitchens one open where they make all of their pizza and another in back where they handle all of the other foods If I m feeling broke I usually go for the pizzas as they are definitely on a lower price spectrum than the pastas The pizzas 9 13 are thin beauties with a slightly chewy crust with fresh high quality toppings Sometimes I wish the crust were slightly charred a la Old World but that is more a personal preference Usually though I go straight for the pastas 12 18 My favorite is the Conchiglie Balsamico a deliciously creamy dish with a tang of shell shaped pasta with slivers of asparagus and tender chicken It s a dish with innovative flavors though the sauce may not appeal to everyone I suggested it once to my mom s friend who wasn t a fan but everyone else I know has liked it I also like the Linguine Vongole and Penne all Arrabbiata with more straightforward flavors but cooked very well none the less They also like to use organic ingredients so don t be surprised if you see Raised Right chicken or Simply Grazin beef I think it s a little snobby but the names themselves are pretty humorous in and of themselves Also if you like nutella the dessert pizza is yummm Sure conceptually the dish is ridiculously simple but can you make a pizza crust like Teresa can No probably not In short while in NY I would probably rate Teresa s a solid 4 this is really as good as it gets without breaking the bank at Princeton 
24y-wk3YeQVXSbMubeCdhw Princeton I should confess that I am currently sprawled out on the sofa in my hotel room holding my tummy and making happy yummy noises This is due to the fact that we wandered into downtown Princeton tonight and ate dinner at the Witherspoon Grill The WG as the locals call it is located next to the library in the quaint little town surrounding the famous university Reservations are required for inside seating but they have a nice covered patio space which allows for al fresco dining Live jazz was playing inside so the ambience was quite nice despite the oppressive heat humidity My business partner and I took our clients to dinner and between the five of us we happily mowed our way through appetizers steaks chops sides and desserts over a leisurely evening Our server was terrific making many helpful suggestions filling the glasses and bread basket and enhancing the dining experience without disrupting our business conversations I started with a cup of lobster bisque which was perfectly seasoned with nice chunks of lobster meat in the soup That was followed by the dry aged strip steak seared on the outside for a nice crust and then pink and juicy in the center Creamed spinach for the side with a healthy dose of garlic I m not normally one for desert but our server recommended a vanilla caramel ice cream sprinkled with sea salt which was made across the street at an organic sweets shop The bill for the five of us was 250 which included the tip Certainly not an outrageous cost for such a terrific meal Great place for a dinner date or an expense account treat insert happy yummy noises here 
28DFLF0ufm1iZt6mGLo3VQ Princeton Elements was recommended to me by a good friend He would be pleased and not so pleased with my experience I had lunch The appetizer was really lovely a Dandelion Gazpacho which came with a preserved lemon ice cream hazelnut bits cucumber shavings and rosemary flowers Spectacular It was bitter and smooth the flower flavor was so delicate and gave the dish a great green snap The hazelnut added a little crunch along with two very crunchy croutons With this I had a glass of the NV Zardetto Prosecco which went perfectly as it was dry Then came the main course pork belly with shrimp The small variety of shrimp were perfectly cooked The spicy sauce was very spicy and the little on the plate went a long way There was a cashew butter sauce as well which had a nice cooling effect However I didn t understand the pork belly at all Most people love the crisp melt in your mouth quality of pork belly This was not crisp It was not seasoned It was like a lump of fat on the plate hard hard to chew not heated not easy to cut with the knife provided Such a shame I would give this restuarnt another chance Sous Chef Mike Ryan is part of the Williams Sonoma Sou Chef Series and I just got his recipe for Mushroom Soup which I can t wait to try Also the waiter rushed me out the door I hate when that happens So two bad marks on an otherwise great visit 
28UpfZDyuxAP3dz98f_XYg Princeton My wife and I have been recommending the Blue Point Grill for years The seafood is fresh and the prices are reasonable It addition the place is BYOB When dining here we usually start our meal with oysters which are excellent We have dined here over the years at least a dozen times Myself I usually opt for the Branzini which is a mild Mediterranean fish The place is rather small with seating outside during the summer when the weather permits Sometimes they also have small groups of musicians playing outside So you can enjoy a bottle of wine while waiting for your table Parking is usually hard to find on the street but they have a small parking on the side between the restaurant and the Ivy Inn which is next door The Ivy is a dive bar but you can get a good cocktail here before your meal Once seated you enjoy a great meal without being rushed for the next seating 
2A9Y3J2UIQi7DlTNTcAgOA Princeton Boring run down typical cheep chineese food service was slow at best We had to ask for more tea since after the food was delivered they never came back to the table Go elsewhere 
2Azc--Jtqb-Aj1qKTRT3Mg Princeton Very pleasant experience What you see is what you get Yes the price is on the high side but the quality and guilt free feeling you get after eating the pizza is worth the premium Would eat again 
2B2_LeFL7o_Qsj7dHXPecw Princeton Tasty and good A bit pricey 
2B3Vzn_AVR4-KW8jWb1iyA Princeton I work in town and have just started going here for lunch Although it is pretty crowded during the lunch rush it s perfect for a late 2 00 lunch I m hooked on the Pizzettas especially the one with Arugula Prosciutto I would highly recommend them if you want great food at a reasonable price 
2BkmyzwdEI8UVjCO2eXXFw Princeton yumm great chicken gyros under 5 cheese fries sandwiches and tons of other food they have a pretty cheap and fast to go their cheese steak is huge they have a decent drink selection and you can sit outside after you get your food on a nice day on the benches 
2brFXEBGBE9kmuNhIbx6Vw Princeton I think J B Winberie s was the very first restaurant I visited in Princeton some 20 years ago while there visiting former student It struck me then as it does now as the quintessential Ivy League college town eatery pub somehow exactly what you would think that would be with lot of wood and that pub in the cellar sort of feel Was back this time to visit yet another student so we stopped here for a quick meal on a Sunday evening Split a great salad and had a fabulous burger that was juicy and loaded with things that are particularly good for you The menu is quite extensive but with so many artsy restaurants in the neighborhood this doesn t seem like the place you d want to go for chicken cordon blue Not sure that was on the menu but you get my drift A really good sandwich burger and beer place is what THIS is 
2ClIBsWLfj_E15lePLxiIQ Princeton I had heard from several people that this place was really good I had lunch there on a Friday afternoon around 2pm and it was wonderful This place offers a much more refined experience than your average pizza shop It is relatively small however they offer outside seating in the back on the patio which is quite lovely The variety of choices is very nice and especially the fact that the owner seems to go out of his way to use ingredients that are natural and organic as much as possible My friend and I shared the Antonia la Caprisiossa pizza my half without the salami along with the heirloom beet salad Fresh crispy and delicious Along with Blueberry ice tea and a lemonade our total bill was 35 Service was really great and quite friendly Recommended 
2dLn6PZJaUqZViK1DHap8Q Princeton My husband and I ate here almost every Friday night this past Summer There was no wait then but we ve been afraid to try it now that the students are back in session The sushi quality is superb The kitchen can get backed up but the wait staff is lovely I m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the decor is lacking and the menu has no variety Given the setting it s a bit expensive 
2do-SE2Q3uFPNNrmpL-aXg Princeton I might not be an expert on Japanese food but I ve tried many restaurants in the area and this one cannot be beat in my book Maybe it s not authentic but I love their chicken teriyaki and they boast a huge menu of sushi that covers the gamut The staff are friendly and the sushi chef is a pro not to mention interesting to watch and interact with 
2EEifvHQqUwYA3Y4pVWphA Princeton wow The best Homemade pasta great food romantic and great wine list Love it 
2eLsbKIX0LerVrQwH2z4FQ Princeton This place isn t anything special but we find ourselves going there a lot because its one of the most convenient when walking around Princeton its not toooo stuffy although its still in Princeton so you know never have to wait for a table and for our single friends there is usually a crowd of other singles for them to mingle albeit cramped mingling with Beer isn t too expensive appetizers are good for vegetarians although I don t think I ve ordered anything but apps I like the cheese dip with apples Overall its a pretty casual place thats nice and centrally located 
2eQz7y4wtdhSBv3yhxf6eA Princeton Everyone s always talking about this place so I decided to finally try it I was expecting to be bedazzled by a sub but ended up being disappointed by a mediocre cheesesteak I don t get why this place is so hyped up I mean i ll try another sub next time perhaps one of the more famous ones but I m not a fan so far Maybe it s a Jersey thing 
2es3-bgTb5fYb8CMjR2HfQ Princeton Best restaurant in town and around Great food great staff Their cheese steak and wings are bomb 
2etLyfji3kY9VTh0UoVQxQ Princeton Main Street Bistro has been a longtime fixture at the Princeton Shopping center and continues to provide very good dining at a very fair price We go often to MSB to avoid the higher priced mediocrity you ll find in Princeton Favorites here include the lamb sliders really excellent the monthly changing of the menu to include new dishes outside dining in the warmer months and the new cabana bar to enjoy a drink or more 
2EvnNfRvIbKzWtvSbLA3ZQ Princeton This is my favorite steakhouse in the area I can honestly say I ve never had a bad meal here I usually get the prime rib and the KC fries are really good too The ambiance is nice as well Quiet and kind of swanky It s not the cheapest place you can find in the area that s one drawback I guess But compared to other high end steakhouses I prefer it 
2f23GlATB4KKhbQSL6Mo6A Princeton WOW what an experience The food and spirits were amazing Had the watermelon salad and morrocan scallops which was incredible For dessert had three tiny scoop of the most unbelievable bent spoon Creations Thought I had died and went to heaven Was not your run of the mill check either 125 00 for two with 2 drinks All in all a gastronomical treat 
2f_XKFMP7oiYIeBm7zsrqg Princeton 24 7 good coffee good drink selection salads sandwiches and pretty much every grocery item you can normally think of May I add that the hoagies sandwiches here are ridiculously good and cheap and they pretty much have everything you ll need including random items such as batteries and bug repellent It s a one stop shop with delicious hoagies Try one if you re in town 
2g0PDwuc1mKkIs_fij3jIA Princeton Nice servers but painfully slow Food is good but relatively overpriced fOr the area 
2gaIFNc2i-uz7AMVWLomHg Princeton Love their food stylish interior and the service is always great Love it here 
2gzJBxOO9NzVcBMtyEZO-A Princeton Pros Bartenders and Waitstaff are excellent Menu is dynamic and usually done well Managers seem to care which matters Obviously the alcohol is a draw but the food and open face chicken sandwich and calamari especially are brilliant Cons hard to get a seat they can get real snooty about bar area stools requiring full dinner orders Hostess quality is as bad as the bartender staff is good amazing to have such a disparity Price can vary rapidly across the menu Still a decent place if you have a reservation or can somehow catch it on a quiet night Decent people watching at worst part of a great princeton bar crawl at best 
2H6BBD0ylFGXQRgkfs376A Princeton The name of this restaurant kind of misled me to think of what I would imagine this place to be I thought this place was a noodle specialty place selling udon ramen wonton etc Instead this place is just a standard low end Chinese restaurant The place is not all that clean Waiters are rude and you feel rushed Food its meh All in all just a standard Chinese restaurant nothing special Don t waste your time here unless you are in the mood for cheap Chinese food FYI This place accepts cash only 
2hbrgmJaJKEVDlKjHNs-gw Princeton When you are in the burbs it s so hard to find a good restaurant among the landscape of chains I have been coming to Sahara Restaurant since I was little and it was my introduction to Middle Eastern food Perhaps my 4 star rating is slightly bias because of this connection to it but I still think the food is rather good I actually would probably rate it lower if it were the same place in the city but given the lack of good eats around here they get a boost I have never had a bad meal here but I dislike that they don t let you order sandwiches later in the day and that it must be platters Sometimes I m just not that hungry The decor has barely changed since I was a kid I remember they renovated at some point but it doesn t look that much better 
2hIwlEEBGkUUan_mOjGJVA Princeton Went here once a few months ago and was not impressed at all I thought the food was mediocre Not only that but I was baffled when the bill came and it was around 150 for two people A BYO sushi place Really Way over priced Well last night we made the mistake of giving it another try and ordered a couple traditional entrees a couple of apps and one roll for takeout The Spicy Roll was awful and laying in a mayo sauce The chicken in the chicken lettuce wraps looked like ground up dog food with unidentifiable things added in Fried tofu pieces I suppose 90 later for a typical Friday night in and I ve finally learned my lesson We won t be back I m sticking with Yummi Sushi 
2hpeUNnM99PxJzkPWxlvwg Princeton Good selection of snacks pre made and made on the spot For newbies you order sandwiches with the touch screens They also have TP and other necessities if it s an emergency and you can t make it to the grocery store I used the ATM here all the time because I wasn t charged by PNC or my bank for withdrawals When my boyfriend would visit me in Princeton Wawa was a must stop on the list so he could get a Buffalo Chicken sandwich The coffee is pretty darn delicious From 6 9AM It s pretty packed with the work crowd either catching the train or working at the university I m also a fan of the slushes and their selection of juices and iced tea This place is PACKED late at night as students return from the eating clubs It s also pretty busy during the lunch rush Be prepared to wait a bit longer 20 minutes for your sandwich during the busy times In summary Cheap good quick food 
2hQ-NjsU15wJYP6s3KqzKQ Princeton Let s get this out of the way I don t like chain restaurants generally I avoid them If there are more than 5 6 of a place I do not eat there Until on a trip to California someone took me to a PF Chang s for dinner Wow Best chain place EVER I loved the food Then I tried the one closest to my home in Princeton home run Outta the park I ve eaten at a couple more all consistent and excellent I m a fan this is a great place to dine Highly recommended 
2Htn4OeujGpgtZ5dX3G03A Princeton I have a hard time rating Chinese restaurants because I so rarely find them to be distinctive from one another I was pleasantly surprised walking into Shanghai Park as small door gives little indication of the spacious well lit interior I had heard they have good bubble tea here so I ordered a Black Tea w milk right away I was not disappointed The tea was sweet not watery and the bubbles big and squishy The meal itself was unremarkable as a majority of American Asian cuisine tends to be It was satisfactory for a casual dinner amongst friends but I wouldn t take my grandparents here on their anniversary Although I will be back for more Bubble Tea 
2hWLd4ZPdvk4JtYUlHq7lg Princeton Best steaks in the continent carne asada 
2I9xSncVoLLyMpa9f6rPIA Princeton This place is weeeeeeak Food is bland It is NOT a taste of Mexico I could make better food on my own at home Chips were saltless Salsa tasted like spaghetti sauce Guac was made fresh was the best thing but was nothing to write home about Don t waste your time or money on this place 
2IRSrwsCSFfmQZAyjxHJ3A Princeton A family visit to Princeton yesterday How could we have not stopped in for some of the best Pancakes around So glad we ate here yesterday The taste texture and everything everything about em From the Buttermilk pancakes to the Fresh Blueberry Pancakes to the Bannana Pancakes all 4 of us were in agreement the best Not our first visit won t be the last 
2J5wxMjU9d68JvxToUpmUA Princeton I saw a review for KC Prime and decided to jump in with a quick one from me I rarely eat red meat but when I crave it this is really the only place that will work I ve been here for dinners weekdays and weekends with my family including a 2 5 year old at the time friends and business Always good Service is attentive but not overbearing Good portion of veggies on the side with my steaks I don t think I ve ever made it to dessert that will have to be a goal next time I go Our table was always ready within 5 minutes of the reservation time and if we decided to stop at the bar for drinks first they held the table for us 
2jLkwK-ZUYD-7ohAtpUWxA Princeton Went here for the first time a few days ago walked in and got a seat at the bar right away We ordered food to go the fish tacos were SLAMMIN Definitely would go back again for the food The beer was good and the waiter was friendly Overall chilled out environment but might be different on busy nights weekends 
2jOilMd04yX7DSB5zWivZA Princeton Don t know why most reviews give this place such low ratings I ts not great but it s definitely decent Been here a myriad times and never was disappointed Yes it s not a great place but it s most solid with good food and drinks 
2jU0j9dEUL3fgwi47Miplw Princeton On the positive side the food was very good but maybe we were more hungry than usual and the service was fast It s a small restaurant with a good decor The menu has lots of words to explain each style of cooking you can get a good education on Indian foods and their origins by reading the menu On the negative side the bathroom was absolutely filthy much like a nasty service station bathroom that s never cleaned The toilet seat was broken trash basket was overflowing paper towels were on the floor and your feet stick to the floor We were one of the first customers at this restaurant on this day so one cannot blame the state of the bathroom on it being used by a herd of pigs just beforehand Hope their kitchen is cleaner than their bathroom No liquor license so BYOB 
2kb8bXIvZod33p_4kdgp8w Princeton The lobster mac and cheese is the only way I will ever eat lobster And I don t love lobster You need to go here And they have arguably the best gourmet burger in the area Service was good prices were expected to be high the wine selection was nice I had a wonderful time Go there if you wanna cheat on your diet with your girlfriends and some drinks 
2kc2sImbzuQ3zuM5y8S0YA Princeton I think people actually live in Small World every single time i step foot into this coffee shop i see the same regulars just in different clothing and sometimes at different tables My goal to achieve that level of regular The staff is veeeery nice and friendly And they are talented too they make an amazing cappucino My favorite times in small world are either when i m reading a book in some secluded corner or listening to live music with a few other people while drinking a cup of joe And indeed it is a small world because everytime i go in i see someone i know 
2KNVY6c8SZUdljqyPnWHuA Princeton Some people say that this is too formal but I would say it s somewhere in between casual and upscale The best time to go is on Wednesday or Thursday night when Arturo Romay is playing guitar Sit near the bar and have a glass of wine or a cocktail Call me before so I can meet you Mediterra has an excellent wine list and friendly bar staff If you re not up for a meal their appetizers are quite tasty Another wonderful place is to sit outside day or night I know people criticize their food but I have never had a bad dining experience It s a good date spot because the lighting is flattering I once saw Gov John Corzine here on a Sunday night with his posse before his accident 
2m37yfmWydxacRPfxad7FQ Princeton Let me start off by saying that I ve been to PF Changs in general probably 8 9 times in the past After last night s experience though I think I m done This place is too trendy pricey and overrall full of itself to get my money any longer I went with family last night and it was for the first time empty I can only hope people finally realized it is not as good as the hype and the trend is dying down Having had good experience with their fish entrees I ordered the Ginger Salmon Considering it s name I thought it would have a ginger flavor Nope it didn t The waitress took it back and upon the manager s recommendations they put in an order for the Grilled Salmon asparagus something Now why they couldn t just redo the Ginger Salmon I don t know The manager brought the new one out of course everyone at my table was already done eating apologized and told me I will love this new dish and it is full of flavor Umm nope This one was the exact same as the last one except they grilled the crap out of it Ugh What is going on with this place Usually everything is salty but at least that is some kind of a flavor They took it off the bill which was nice it was an 18 50 entree with no flavor but come on I don t recommend this place considering it s not authentic everything is crazy overpriced the staff is slow and drinks are ridiculously priced too and apparently their cooking staff and management are idiots My bf loves this place but after this he can go there alone Oh and I agree with another poster Instead go to Sunny Garden which is a short walk away behind the Pep Boys That is a great place for authentic Asian fare Screw PF Wangs 
2n4HeFSMCrbb3BZkvYxCbQ Princeton I went here about a year ago and by the looks of the reviews not much has changed The place was attached to the hotel which always seems like it s not going to be as good as it would be if it was a stand still place I had gone on Valentine s Day but late around 8 30 it wasn t that busy and we had a reservation It took 10 15 minutes to sit and another 10 minutes for the waiter to come over for our orders I remember the food wasn t even that good for the price and it took FOREVER for our food our waiter sucked badly I thought it was an more upscale place I was wrong We had a coupon for a certain amount of money off if we spend like 100 and they told us that they had to put gratuity on it because of the coupon I m pretty sure that s bullshit he just wanted a good tip which he did not deserve I left feeling like it wasn t worth my time I wouldn t recommend this place There are much better places to eat that are just down Route 1 Especially if you re going for steak it s not worth it 
2N73Qm_9KbUk1jlLjBIxCw Princeton It s a greasy sandwich place Check that It s THE greasy sandwich place I m completely biased in that I went to Princeton and my formative Haven experiences were spent largely intoxicated Simply perfect food at 1 59am they close at 2 If it were possible to give bonus points for being optimal drunk food I d give them to the Haven I still live in the area and still have the opportunity to have a nostalgic hoagie every now and then Even sober they re great They re not haute cuisine They re great crappy sandwiches if that makes sense In my 15 years of Havening I ve only had about a half dozen things on the menu First of all contrary to some other reviewers opinions if you re getting a cold sandwich you re wasting your time Because I m old I ve been thoroughly scared of the new offerings Sanchez etc Cheesesteak Pizza cheesesteak Bacon cheesesteak Hot pastrami Chicken parm and the omelet subs That s it For 15 years on and off a greasy hole in the wall has had me happily coming back for one of six sandwiches I think that s telling enough Just get everything on whatever you order if you re new There is a good natured soup nazi vibe in that the other customers ll get pissed if you don t keep the line moving Rightfully so The hot gooey goodness of any of the hot subs will totally disintegrate the bread in about 5 minutes Time is of the essence If you want a fancy expensive sandwich and I have no problem with that there are about a dozen places in town you can go If you want satisfying gullet filling greasyness Hoagie Haven is the only game in town 
2nc2Hexf5i0MCElq_UURag Princeton Excellent service and superb food The restaurant is a little noisy but the quality of the food compensates for this 
2Nq__JTxM77tgY0qPlTSVg Princeton Best Mexican in Princeton I wouldn t say it exactly satisfies the craving but it quiets it a bit Pretty good mole sauce rice and beans generally large portions Solid but not authentic enough I do like the casual atmosphere and it s actually a relaxing walk from downtown on a nice night 
2N_UuLABu4KNdivfPQbetQ Princeton I like Asian Bistro it is the only Korean food in the area 10 mile proximity I m willing to pay for and outshines its older sibling Nassau Sushi in taste ambiance and staff friendliness There is a bountiful photo menu most of which looks good but I find the Korean dishes most appealing Besides food there is a pretty awesome soda selection including sparkling spring water way to go far out of reach sodas and free barley tea It has an interior I appreciate and outside seating too if the train tracks don t bother Keep this local gem alive visit soon 
2o20EX34Mzff2b34I6H1SQ Princeton Caveat I am a black coffee purist so I cannot comment on milky lattes and other such coffee beverages As for their coffee however I think it is great Don t tell Starbucks but I have been cheating on them more and more lately I love that the Starbucks on Nassau St got a Clover machine recently and have been enjoying the reserve coffees there but Small World s coffees are just as good House blend is a reliable go to Also enjoyed the organic love blend I usually take my joe to go so I can t say much about the atmosphere Typical coffee shop in a college town I suppose Staff are always friendly This is a great place to get a cup of coffee when the Starbucks rut has you down and you can t stand the line 
2p9CNrw45AQoJjxzDTdUow Princeton This place was an amazing find off the beaten path on the outskirts of downtown Princeton NJ My wife and I found this place and gave it a shot over the other Italian places in our area WE WERE AMAZED AT HOW GOOD IT WAS Everything is great including the romantic environment and music Its an open kitchen so you can see the cook and the rest of the staff moving around Make sure to get the chicken parmigiana its the best in all of NJ 
2pjRCIrJX_jFTyluV2zENQ Princeton A veritable pantheon of Italian culinary delights It certainly took me some time to get a full appraisal of all the terrific options Everything looked fresh and delicious and I settled on a sandwich which was sliced and made to order Some of the best mortadella I ve had since living in Italy My family had been driving a half hour to our preferred Italian deli but we might have a new place 
2pXQsgN_8-NLLMSuJRo4lg Princeton A breath of fresh or at least coffee filled air in Princeton Affordable down to earth and filled with yum A bit noisy if you re on your laptop but hey at least it s not aseptic I just wanted to use a big word so all these Princeton people think I m smart 
2RGqO-qFNYHAXVDX0wFh_Q Princeton Love this little place It s a manageable supemarket without the weird vibe of many health food stores Full of just plain good stuff They stock a lot of local meat dairy and produce and point it out A must stop for locavores 
2rU9V7vy8EGt7_tTfAywMA Princeton Dinner at the Bar Review Came here after a coworker a former Princeton ite and another coworker suggested this place as a place to catch AP on MNF Rollin Han Solo style I sat at the bar the pre game show was on with no sound and a Jammin slow jam playing in the background By Jammin I mean completely inappropriate for MNF No worries though the bartender turned up the volume on one of the TVs so balance but not hide the jammin slow jam in the background Ordered the Mediterranean Pasta with Chicken Muy Excellente I must say Quite enjoyed the penne pasta with chicken olive oil capers sun dried tomatoes and olives Was kind of sad to hear after I was drinking my Guinness that they had a 3 Tall Coors Light special I guess I had to be a local or at least just smart enough to ask do you have any specials to find out what they re specials are I enjoyed my time there could see myself venturing here if I was a local 
2TQYrBUrXMCT-et_EJy0lg Princeton Cockroaches As we were mid way into the entrees we saw a cockroach on the wall right next to us Disgusting The restaurant s response was worse than that if possible The server was a nice kid who asked if we want to move etc but in spite of the fact that we literally left our meal mid way and still hungry they decided to present the bill to us anyway Of course no apology The manager owner lady was perfectly terrible about this she refused to cancel the bill and in fact insisted that the kitchen was clean and that we should pay since get this we didn t find cockroaches in our food Naturally we just left but left a tip for the server since he had been helpful The manager owner lady ran behind us outside and continuing her rant told me that she could bet she could find cockroaches in my home ABSURD To think that they want to charge 15 20 for their entrees Gordon Ramsey would shut the kitchen down in a minute We spent the rest of the evening terrified that we might get food poisoning UPDATE I received an email from a person claiming to be a former server in this restaurant He claimed that the owners keep all the tips and nothing gets passed on to the waitstaff If you needed any more reasons to avoid this place 
2U5qQ9WnfdQq9k5B0ipfnA Princeton Seen this place many times while in Princeton but never had a time to try it out Finally got a chance to try their lunch buffet with my sisters and a friend this weekend Pros Pretty big selection Most other buffets have more customers yet have a much less options Goat something was very flavorful Delicious rice pudding Kheer Only ever been to one other indian lunch buffet that served rice pudding and was very pleasing that this place offered it with the buffet package AND it was one of the best I ve ever had Good naan and replenished our supply frequently For 9 99 person it s a good deal Cons All meats with the exception of the goat were hard and overcooked No flavor penetrated the outer layers Tandoori chicken was the worst I ve ever had Extremely dry and no flavor what so ever Green chutney was bitter This one waitress was so inattentive My plate was empty and sitting in the middle of the table for 15 minutes until I finally gave up and just put it under my other plate She came by to restock us on naan and refill water but even when I asked her to take the plate she just walked away And there were only two other tables What was up with that All in all this place was okay I ll stop by if I m ever craving Indian food on a budget and happen to be in Princeton But only if Palace of Asia were closed 
2U8_pt8tnAdi-uhWEev_SQ Princeton Been coming here for 17 years the gold standard for wings as Tastee Subs are for subs If your from Central Jersey you exactly what I mean 
2u8_RQ5KhMuC4wyklidFyg Princeton Prior to ordering we were asked if we had a Groupon which we did We ordered Vegetable Samosas Chicken Kashmiri Zafrani Vegetable Biryani Tandoori Shrimp and Garlic Naan The samosas were perfectly prepared and served hot The chicken dish was OK lacking flavor and a very small serving size The biryani dish was average The Tandoori Shrimp was terrible chewy overdone and small serving size The menu listed the price for this shrimp dish at 14 95 but we were charged 15 95 The garlic naan had too much raw garlic Groupon adds an 18 tip which considering the mediocre food was more than generous We left a few extra bucks for the very kind waiter but we ll never go back We also notified the owner of the price discrepancy with the shrimp dish He acted surprised but I m not convinced he was 
2uaHm5vQfAGFhMpGjB-c7w Princeton My first 5 star review We tried to make a reservation for Saturday night but they were booked We walked in and found out the outside tables are for walk ins if available After about 1 2 hour we were seated very easy I am a NYC foodie and seek out great food experiences I can say for sure that this was one of them The shrimp dumplings warm goat cheese salad and buffalo rock shrimp appetizers were great for the 4 of us to share and we loved them Our entrees included seared scallops blackened redfish triple tailed snapper with capers in a lemon butter sauce and crab cakes All 4 of us loved EVERYTHING including the sides mashed sweet potatoes french fries rice and baked potato Perhaps the best crab cakes any of us have had and trust me when I say we ve tried them all over the east coast Service was solid and not rushed We brought wine since it s BYOB and skipped dessert because we were all just too full We will absolutely be going back hopefully soon 
2uz7vOqo7TXuHehW783Ghw Princeton I went here with a group of 8 for a friend s birthday and we had an excellent time When we arrived for our reservation our table was ready with the menus sitting on the table I was happy to see that they were prepared for our arrival and we didn t have to wait at all A great start Our server William was extremely friendly helpful and kind the entire night We always had our water glasses full and the service was definitely outstanding We started off with a stuffed mushroom special and the calamari The calamari was lightly fried and not too greasy Both appetizers were very good For our entrees we all had something different I had the trenette linguini in a tomato basil sauce with vegetables The linguini was cooked perfectly al dente and was quite delicious My only complaint was that my dish was a little cold as I was one of the first people to receive my meal but I imagine this would not be the case if I went with a smaller group My friends had the chicken marinara rigatoni pork ossobucco pappardelle and fettuccine Though I did not get to try everyone s dish they all seemed pleased and content with what they ordered I would strongly recommend this restaurant as the food was outstanding and the service even better 
2V70FU9wr6Va3FWBf3N8Xw Princeton I went with my wife and it looks like 5stars and the service was But the food was tasteless I was very disappointed To me it tasted like the noodle packs you buy in the frozen section and make up in 15 min First and last time I will go maybe I got them on a bad day I don t know but I think there are better choices around 
2ViOH-rsEsoZNViMc9z4Gg Princeton I used to work here as kid in the 70 s Prices went up servings got smaller and quality of food left Princeton If you want to spend 20 for pancakes it s your place I was employed in every job this place has so I know it from top to bottom Not the same PJ s as back in the day The line used to go down around the Garden Theater And they would wait for over an hour Was tempted it to give it a one star but it s not that bad Carve your name in something when you get your seat 
2VsSkRCRQuH0fLz_MZ0rkg Princeton My favorite hoagie joint 
2WnXcGQdiVA1RRhleyWSyg Princeton All I can say is Hell Yes I don t need to speak about the food just try it yourself If I had to decide between Red Lobster and here you can believe I ll be rolling over here 
2XKvWN_h1E3u-wYo3eZe8w Princeton This was the first last Chili s I am going to visit Maybe I am bias b c I am a city guy but it was a chargin experience for me my friend But i guess franchises aren t suppose to blow your mind just barely meet standards now The food was sub par service was good despite the waiter forgot my sauce tequilla lime sauce for my entree Thinking back on it now it adding the sauce made my shrimp entree worse Their beer selections were wide but the beer I ordered was another letdown down guess it was in the fridge too long Two thumbs down But service was attentive 
2XmhoZ7SMs2SN9o43tlKWA Princeton The sushi is amazing I came to this little unassuming restaurant with my grandmother who had been there twice before for the sushi She walks in says We want sashimi to the host who seats us then has the sushi chef come over to talk to us He asked us what kind of fish we liked if we liked it sweet or spicy or sour then recommended some wonderful dishes The Seafood Parfait was delightful and the Hot Lover roll is to die for The fish on our sashimi platter was so fresh and tender it was fantastic And on top of that he made us this adorable sushi dessert that was really interesting and tasty This restaurant might be in a strip mall but their sushi chef makes this place one of my top picks for sushi 
2yIA3Aq-J8vg_n_iufiahg Princeton When we were first married we went to Ruth s Chris for each anniversary No longer newlyweds we went back last weekend to celebrate again Very few restaurants live up to your memory of them but this did Everything from soup to dessert was delicious 
2yokBJYiJLpTKNbP_L-qcA Princeton This busy restaurant on Witherspoon St is definitely worth a visit if you re in Princeton They serve an eclectic mix of meals and all are wonderfully prepared The wait staff is attentive The decor is very pleasant for a great dining experience Please visit but forget to BYOB 
2Yo_reeMkXj7WWiDSnbCEQ Princeton Teresa s uses fresh produce to make simple yet interesting Italian cuisine The bread comes from the Witherspoon bakery and is excellent served with a herbed olive oil The wine list has a good price range from very affordable to some better bottles Service is good and its always busy Note that you can t book We ve never had to wait long at all but have only gone in groups of 2 or 3 A larger group might be a problem 
2YXcOBQlssDFbP2KysyHhQ Princeton another east coast chinese restaurant you know shiny food with same old taste i went there with a friend who s visiting her cousin in princeton we got general tso s chicken and chicken in garlic sauce both dishes were nice general tso s chicken was crispy and tasty and the chicken in garlic sauce was tender they didn t blow my mind though the portion was much larger than tiger noodles AND more importantly they didn t use as much MSG as tiger noodles so on your way to tiger noodles you should stop a block early and eat here instead the food is cheaper and better and contains less msg and the eating area is more spacious 
2z0X7a5MChUPadH4U2uD_w Princeton I ve been here numerous times and we have them cater lunches at work often Food is excellent some of the best in all of Princeton The service can be slow sometimes but their just getting it together Lamb kebabs and chicken kabobs are awesome Hummus is solid 
2zCilMYLy3Ax924iA6Hnqg Princeton WHY another Princeton Sushi Restaurant FAILURE There is barely any sushi which is what i came here to eat and the food they have is bland I tried a dish my friend ordered and realized the trader joes section of Microwave yourself dishes are better tasting How sad that another large space has opened up and has misled sushi lovers everywhere to believing that this is step up from Ichiban 
2ZDKLk2098Gr3nw709PfeQ Princeton Happy with the service and the Sushi very rare to find both at the same time in NJ It is my second visit will def recommend it 
2ZnFLpqUeM84gfxA3Z014w Princeton This is probably the best all you can eat sushi in NJ PA Not only is it priced right the food is outstanding Their list of rolls has all the standard fair plus a few interesting varieties There is a great selection of sides apps as well as awesome chef specials All of the seafood is super fresh I agree with other reviews that the service can be a bit slow during peak hours but try to go a bit early late and you won t be disappointed Another great tidbit is that this place is a BYO so grab a nice bottle of wine or some great craft beer and you ll have an amazing night out This place is great for taking medium sized groups and sharing a large variety of food 
2zT3hkU7v9a81JA6YmFM7Q Princeton I read that this place was featured somewhere online as one of the top places to go in the country for pancakes I think it was also on the Food Network but I could be wrong about that Regardless I couldn t imagine it being in the same league with Norma s in NYC the hands down best place to get blueberry pancakes but I was willing to give it a shot I love pancakes My boyfriend disagrees with the list He lives here I don t when in DC we go to The Original Pancake House talk about FAB pancakes We ve been dating for over a year now and for over a year now I ve been wanting to try this place We finally went this weekend He was experiencing a weak moment The place is small and packed to the gills we had to sit at the counter The service at least ours was extremely friendly and efficient The decor is typical of any greasy spoon including the sign posted in the service station asking the wait staff to push selling the subs Think Mel s Diner and you ll know exactly what I mean Now onto the food J shorthand for my boyfriend s name ordered the pancakes eager to prove his point with sausage and extra bacon I ordered scrambled eggs scrambled dry with swiss and whole wheat toast Ordering scrambled eggs in a diner type place always produces anxiety for me because I HATE HATE HATE runny eggs This is not a problem at La Croix in Philly which happens to serve the most divine scrambled eggs ANYWHERE yes scrambled eggs CAN be divine My eggs arrived on a plastic plate no HUGE surprise I moved them around with my fork J awaited my verdict he knows how freaked out I get I smiled They were PERFECT This was a pleasant surprise And they actually had Chollula hot sauce I prefer never to eat eggs without it My toast was of the multigrain variety and it was superb a complete departure from the wonderbread esque wheat toast I ve had at other establishments But true delight came in the form of a potato mash that accompanied my eggs with a definite southwestern influence I had to fight to keep them to myself So far so good J waited patiently while I ate nibbling at his pancakes sausage and bacon Secretly he was dying for me to stab into his pancakes he loves being right And of course I did JUST that One bite and I knew exactly what he had been saying all along THESE WERE NOT GOOD PANCAKES They were rubber disks with faux maple syrup Awful Now if you want to experience pancake Nirvana I can recommend two places for sure and they are both already mentioned in this review All of that being said this is a decent local breakfast place and the epitome of a greasy spoon with prices suitable for any budget The two star rating is due to the incongruency of the restaurant name with the product for sale Pancake house Not a chance And in case you disagree the pancakes are made from a pre packaged mix Even I make pancakes from scratch and I don t charge money for them I actually think it is absurd that THIS establishment is even ALLOWED to own the pancakes com URL It s an insult to pancakes everywhere 
2_BpL4W5f8TbwEQAX_spGw Princeton Went for a family dinner here with our 2 and 5 year old for our anniversary The experience was amazing Picked up wine a liquor store few stores down BYOB food was amazing Kids loved it also which is not easy to do Octopus appetizer was brilliant My wife who is as picky as ca be when it come to seafood loved the place And the wait staff take the time explain the menu if needed and are chef adjusts where possible to accommodate By my take one of the best seafood place I have been too in Central NJ I wold rank on top of my list A must go Highly recommended 
3-egJUinmYxl42b9ZJBriw Princeton it will always be busy here don t really plan on getting much studying done as well but the coffee is good i have had their chai once great chai if you love spices but i like things on the sweeter side comparable pricing with starbucks down the block but also offers more seating note closes earlier than starbucks so go here during the day 
30j7TzThpDpmz6nv8Hn9CQ Princeton The Ferry House used to be our favorite restaurants notice the term used to My wife and I had been a pleased customer of this restaurant for about 6 years dating back to 2004 We can always count on an excellent meal every time we visited We noticed the quality of the food and services had declined in recent years due to change in management but our most recent visit in July was the last straw The night started off fine with our waiter giving us the dinner specials but everything went down hill once the order was taken We spent half of our nights swatting flies that were buzzing around our table we did not see our waiter again until he came back to take our dessert orders not once did he come back and asked how our food was We had to request a different waiter to open our wines that were on the table on multiple occasions The icing on the cake was when I asked him to put a birthday candle my wife s birthday on the dessert another waiter brought out the dessert and just threw it in front of my wife and walked away I am not sure what our Waiter s mentality was maybe he thought this is a party more than 6 I am guaranteed 20 tip and I don t need to pay attention to their needs He can t use busy as an excuse because the restaurant was half empty Overall he was rude inconsiderate and certainly do not deserve the gratuity that was indicated on the check The food wasn t as good as it use to be and it tasted extra disappointing due to the horrible service we received I am not sure what changed throughout the years but this visit had certainly been our worst This was our favorite restaurant in Princeton and we often recommend friends and family to visit this restaurant when they are around town After our most recent visit I am afraid my above statement no longer holds true 
31-mlE4JUheItdUZjyjMPw Princeton it s hard to screw up your experience here because they will let you sample their soups so definitely take advantage of that and make sure you order what you find taste delicious I really like their new england clam chowder The soups comes with a bag of small biscuit crackers personally chicken noodle and lobster crab bistro is a meh for me here Their soup menu changes everyday you can go search for them on facebook and see what soups they offer they post it everyday on there They use whole wheat bread for their sandwiches which is nice if you like eating healthy I ve only had 1 of their sandwiches it was the vegetarian one that started with a G It just had tomato cheese lettuce and this vinegar dressing I found too sour Eating a sour sandwich is just weird for me 
31a8Auu_ss0QcDYk8YJNjg Princeton Had lunch here on Saturday The outdoor seating area was filled so we ate inside The service was attentive without being intrusive There was a nice selection of oysters which is always a plus My steak sandwich was exactly that steak A nice but not overwhelming portion The beer selection was good as well the dead guy ale hit the spot This place looks very well run and has their act together which counts for a lot Recommended 
32OZjRQrjx3fbmqtecT6Gw Princeton no increase in rating yet but yet implies that there will be a next time Nassau Inn management contacted us and refunded us the full price of our stay plus offered to make it up to us with a complimentary night at the hotel including dinner AND breakfast at the YDTR i gotta say THAT S customer service I m impressed 
32Ub6v6Cggy3oKxEmNF2hg Princeton my intended and i went in blind after seeing the sign from the street we were starving with limited time the order board makes it easy and the toppings were right on this was a tuesday and after ordering we noticed a sign that read two for tuesdays or something of that nature basically we could have ordered another for free no one said jack shit so i called the guy on it and he said it was true and that he could make us another i said we were running late and that i d stop back after our show for our other pizza he didnt think that was a good idea worried as we read the previous yelp reviews turns out it was pizza and was good but the service thing kinda made me sad later i cried while in the fetal position laying in a puddle of my own sweat urine and tears 
34afeaWJtcFN5ARTaF4k-g Princeton I really am not a fan of Americanized Chinese Food because sauces tend to be gloppy and heavy I generally choose Thai Japanese or Korean over any Chinese restaurant Shaghai has proven to be an exception to the rule Not everything is fantastic here but most things are very good The service is pretty terrible but I ve never had a bad meal so I m willing to forgive that Contrary to a few of the other reviews I ve found the food here to be as good as most of the restaurants in NY s Chinatown 
37hhqG_b5_IIwGYclgcEgQ Princeton I have been to many Pengangs NYC New Brunswick Boston etc the food here is consistently very good Everything is seasoned very well fresh and spicy There s plenty of seating and the service is pretty fast Sometimes it can be hectic and wait staff get a little confused best Thai food in Princeton area 
38e9zuw0gjicnADCfVz3Yw Princeton This is definately my favorite Hooters I have been to Friendly staff The food is amazing It s the usual Hooters food They basically always taste the same from place to place but I have noticed that I do like the food here a little than the other s The atmosphere is great though and that s what matters in a place like this 
38iWlRCAT-mYAgZTBPhzuA Princeton Not the best often but healthy choices and you know what you get 
38Z6uAO3PJ1cJAVupF-Xjg Princeton Celebrated two birthdays here last night and so glad we did Our second time at the restaurant was as good as the first Great service by Nadia and staff The filet mignon prime ribs lamb chops and red snapper were all delicious Since I mentioned we were celebrating my mother s and my birthday they brought two brownies with ice cream on the house for dessert which I thought was such a thoughtful thing to do This is exactly why this restaurant is so packed on a Sat night at 7 PM they aim to please and listen to their patrons I m a lamp chop fan and KC Prime is definitely on a par with the steakhouses I love in NY Del Frisco Sparks Rothman s Rare 650 Capital Grille Will definitely try their Sunday brunch next 
3A4nul7C3SOw4B5fxh6FqQ Princeton I remember waiting for this restaurant to open and was very happy when I finally got to eat there Route 206 not a great road to drive on in general especially with the awful traffic 24 7 Elements is about a good 20 minute walk away from Nassau Street I think this restaurant would of done a little less successfully on Nassau Street personally because of all the competitors but that is just a personal opinion Anyway I thought the prices were not bad for a restaurant with such prestige Elements With affordable prices the food stands up to it s expectations 
3AaEjGvMCIRNzrYJb3NjsQ Princeton At first I was disappointed to see that Ajihei left which was a yummy Japanese restaurant But then my husband and I decided to try Kaliente one night as we had a craving for good Mexican food which is really non existent in Princeton We were pleasantly surprised by the delisciousness of the food as well as the prices I had the combination taco plate and my hubby had the burrito We ordered it to bring home and even after a 15 min drive home the food was still incredibly tasty and worthy of such a rating 
3aTzL4DG4ch03SPd1qvu1w Princeton Amazing Steak cooked to perfection Family style sides amazing Great atmosphere Had the steak shrimp recently and OH SWEET GOODNESS Can t wait to go back there 
3aZUFzBcaGdzedyl1JOmCw Princeton May not be truly authentic Chinese but it sure is yummy This is an excellent place to take your family or your partner s family on a special occasion I ve heard fantastic things about the lunch buffet and the sushi but sadly haven t been able to try either yet All of the food I ve had here has been excellent and the prices very reasonable for value recieved You re going to pay more than you would at your typical take out place but then again the food is much much better and so is the atmosphere 
3Be_jMvweVx_z7k3DTyylg Princeton The atmosphere is really amazing Great for dates or a group of friends Loved the live music and the patio where we ate Came here with my boyfriend and two friends If one word could describe our waitress it would be disoriented I ordered sparkling water and she had no reaction as she poured most of the contents of the bottle onto the table instead of in my glass Half way through our meal she also asked if there was a fire across the street There wasn t and there was really no reason to ask I think our dinner would have been better without that awkwardness The food was OK Fried calamari was not good Skip it I ordered the Paella That was also not up to my expectations Paella isn t a dish that chefs should alter but it was and the result was sub par from authentic paella The place is nice I would give it another shot just because of the atmosphere 
3C-v2E9jVD5o7xdocNgKzw Princeton My family and I came here to celebrate my little cousin s first birthday party We had about a group of 60 people and were in the banquet hall The hall was decorated very nicely and looked classy As soon as you walk in there is a big statue of Ganesh which was very nice The food however was not so great They make a variety of dishes from pani puri to idli and dosas and the obvious punjabi dishes For a restaurant that has great variety it really does not excel in any food from any region All of the food is pretty bland I had the paneer tika masala which was loaded with paneer but had very little taste in the curry I also had the Gobi Manchurian which actually was pretty good The rice and dal were mediocre and the Naan was too crispy at some parts and too chewy at others 
3c11eYQBp-pSOSbKB7TV0g Princeton ONE OF THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES The Sandwiches are great although pricey I have never been disappointed with the food 
3chl5es3bVxBZC5XTRd-iA Princeton I 100 recommend the garganelli The mushrooms and truffle butter are delicious The wine list and atmosphere are very nice Everything I ve tasted here has made my taste buds sing 
3CQSqGZILQE90e_VZrXuqA Princeton I felt duped Stopped in the other night with a buddy of mine Ordered the nachos and was talked into the large order My thought was how much more could the larger order be if the small one was only 7 or 8 bucks Well when the bill came the nachos which sucked by the way as they were nothing more than a mountain of burnt cheese some beans and some variety of meat were 15 bucks Really That some coffee drink and dessert and my bill was over 30 bucks For that amount of money there are much better places than the tale Food has sucked for a while anyway We are taking a long hiatus from this joint If we ever return at all 
3cWFO5tsTYHKwIsLBF_jdA Princeton One word to describe this place consistent They have CONSISTENTLY managed to mistaken me as a Chinese person the past 3 years I have gone there So maybe in their disappointment service has CONSISTENTLY been horrid They have been short with me every time I go Very rude So I be short with them too 1 order of Soup Dumpling at 6 95 CHEAP 1 order of soup spicy cabbage or shredded pork with hot peppers are the default ones Eat and bounce But to linger on the food It s okay I have had better I have had bigger and tastier soup dumplings but this place is certainly more CONSISTENT in what you expect For that I give it 3 total stars for this place 
3CyYuWMKSwFrxkE3l3DFYQ Princeton This is my go to place for a good vegetarian meal if I m in downtown Princeton The owner is really nice and gives you a warm welcome every time I usually get the falafel or the tomato mozz sandwich with basil I also enjoy their fries a lot 
3d9A358Ob_UdkLMCpracng Princeton Love this place You have to know what you re coming for If you re looking for precise execution carefully orchestrated flavors ultra exotic uber fresh seafood and little bit sized works of art you re not at the right place so don t come and be disappointed If you re looking for no frills sushi joint that services up really tasty fresh sushi sashimi rolls I never get it but their teriyaki looked awesome too and don t need it to be so refined this is your place It s sushi comfort food a lil messy but so yummy you salivate just watching them make it I actually moan a little but I try to keep it quiet P and so satisfying you leave in a food coma A food coma how many sushi places can you say that about Only place like it And of course for it s portions it s cheap The portions are so generous it s downright decadent I watched my friend pick up a slice of salmon sashimi from their chirashi and it can easily make up 2 maybe 3 pieces of sashimi back home in NYC Their rolls are so chock full of stuff whether it be fish spicy tuna avocado or what not that yes sometimes it bursts open I see others spicy tuna roll and the chef just throws an extra heap of spicy tuna on top of the roll just for kicks I got a ankimo monkfish liver sashimi 2 pieces that would have easily made 4 actually 5 because he finished off his ankimo on my order and just gave me the remaining piece pieces and both had a healthy scoop of ikura on top And considering ankimo is a bit more exotic than the run of the mill tuna and salmon it was fresh and tasty too No the ikura is not Ushiwakamaru fresh and sweet but it was as good as any average even expensive sushi place and it was just thrown in as part of the ankimo As I said love this place 
3DdmsSWlVcG7zULGkGkUoA Princeton I ve eaten here twice both times for lunch I ve had different sandwiches both times and was very pleased I love the fries and the sandwiches were both unique enough to make an impression This is a great place to go for a quick work lunch in Princeton 
3dMenhBxN9laEgf78beZAA Princeton Nice place we brought our own wine as that s the way they do it here The service was fantastic and we got really good recommendations from the server The Grilled octopus appetizer was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious I had the mixed grill with Sea bass and another fish both of which were perfectly cooked My sister had the scallops which were super excellent So succulent The rice and potato were good and the side of broccoli was good 
3dVkqCLbHxgFFJKzsX6T0w Princeton Some restaurants are popular in spite of their location and or tradition others are mainly because of that PJ definitely belongs to the later being on Nassau Street and directly across from Princeton campus Familiarity and or quaintness appeals to the loyal and or curious weekend morning crowd There is not much distinction a restaurant can add to the familiar pancake but give PJ some brownie points pun intended for being creative like with its sampler blueberry raisin and banana the least favorite based on the collective family member opinions 
3f-A8YBm0tuulZvIXURGTg Princeton Very expensive for what you get The fries here are very good and crunchy The beers are about 5 and the mojitos are about 12 Unlike many of the other reviews our large party received excellent service 
3FbuIcl40iQuTfkK-fiKhw Princeton Come for the beer they ve usually got quite the spread though they do run out on certain offerings a little more frequently than I like From ambers to lagers to stouts to IPAs this place has got it Personal favorites Pumpkin in the fall Rauchbier smoky flavor depending on how the brew turns out it can have a smoky campfire like taste or it can taste like bacon Weird I know but downright delicious For around 10 12 get the tasting sampler 7 5 oz beers Boom Food here is hit or miss Whenever they get creative with their menu I feel like it is an epic flop The standards however are generally good burgers sandwiches apps aka bar food In short come to drink and don t expect a 5 star dining experience Check out their location in New Hope too they have outdoor seating there right next to the railroad station 
3fIFr_JbuDBJ3ENetCcUuw Princeton Princeton is so charming but the restaurants here are sub par the Bent Spoon is excluded from this claim As another yelper mentioned my friend called ahead and when we got there on time we still had to wait about 20 minutes at the door and I wouldn t have minded so much if the hostess wasn t so snooty Our server was very nice but not as attentive When our main dishes came out none of the empty plates were cleared I had the Farrauto salad made with spinach Gorgonzola cheese toasted pine nuts it s hard for me to resist pine nuts my dad makes such an amazing broccoli rabe and pine nut pasta and chopped apple cubes The dressing was a creamy balsamic vinaigrette I thought it was a little bit overpriced but each ingredient went together well and warmed up my palate for my pizza I chose the margherita pizza It was well portioned for one person simple and delicious I must say no match for my beloved Nomad Pizza Company right down the road in Hopewell NJ but yummy nonetheless The cheese is not very salty and I like the dough a little chewier The server was honest to tell us that the NJ wine on the specials list was not good so we chose a California Cabernet I had one glass too many My friends enjoyed their pastas the Penne all Arrabiata and the Penne Integrale 
3Fvc88NnewPooc0yYT3Tdw Princeton I d give Triumph 3 5 stars I think the beer here is overrated for a micro brewery I ve definitely had better But that said the tripel is delicious although it s not on tap often and the wheat beer is good It s a bit pricey for bar food burgers fish and chips etc and they aren t outstanding for the price The atmosphere is fun but it s always loud and crowded I ve been here to both drink and eat For drinking there isn t much room to sit let alone set your beer down for long even on weeknights For eating it s not the place to go on a date if you want to hear each other talk If you re lucky you can get one of the booths or a table upstairs which are more isolated 
3h8VcM7qlH5YeF_Yu5RZtQ Princeton Very inconsistent Was excellent when I dined in August Then returned in October and ordered the same items The NY strip was stringy and not worth the money Two tenderloins were cooked well over done and were gray and ruined What more can I say a steak restaurant that couldn t consistently cook great steak We did return three steaks and the replacements were good but the damage was done It was a busy night and the kitchen was not up to task I expect better and I have had better at the exact same restaurant 
3Hch-zGoWmAjf9vnn5-_vA Princeton I have never been for their pizzas so I can t judge those but their cheesesteaks always make me super sick Pronto Like walking down Nassau Street fast I thought it was just a fluke at first and went back a few times since they used to be decent Nope something def wrong there Maybe their other foods are better 
3HCLEAmtcLHYs5UqWfiXVA Princeton Don t miss this hidden gem in Princeton it s a subterranean treasure of all good things Italian My mother and I stumbled upon it on a foul weather Sunday night when we were cold tired and hungry never a good combination We were delighted to find a warm and inviting dining room and bar area and were greeted warmly and shown to a table From the mini garlic rolls and olive oil olives dipping sauce to the excellent chianti we knew we had found something good Our server was very friendly and was able to give us great reccomendations When I am away from the East Coast I crave fresh pasta and vodka sauce so I had the stuffed rigatoni for my entree It was absolutely perfect house made al dente pasta stuffed with ricotta cheese sauteeed with baby spinach and topped with a creamy vodka sauce These little pillows of heaven were just what I needed to warm me and comfort my palate My mom had a white pizza with rosemary very tasty with a thin crust and just the right amount of charred crackly bits to keep her happy For dessert we split the tiramisu It s an untraditional presentation in a martini glass but the dessert is just what you would hope for cream espresso soaked ladyfingers etc The place was packed by the time we left which was a good sign and many people were obviously regulars The prices are a little higher than other places around town so the only university students there are most likely with their parents A best bet for a home made straighforward Italian meal whether you are a local or a visitor to Princeton 
3hQCKvC4nWHXm7mVyo5E_Q Princeton Have only been once but it really blew us away The restaurant is gorgeous We were there on a snowy night and it was so warm inside with a fire blazing Food was very very good with the cheese plate as the standout A little out of our normal price range but can t wait for a reason to go back 
3I29I-X9Vu36VgYA9A4xpw Princeton Went last night Saturday March 7 5 45pm reservation My daughter was at a friends so we had the open early time slot My wife made the reservation the night before Funny Salt Creek Grille didn t have anything open at that time Personally I would eat at Ruth s Chris over Salt Creek anytime I ve been to Ruth s Chris in NYC Palm Springs Scottsdale and Philly so I am familiar with the concept and the execution We drove down and parked nearby rather than do the Complimentary valet parking The 1 minute walk to the restaurant in 60 degree weather was not an issue Ruth s Chris built this restaurant on the site From the outside it looks a bit like a converted bank I found the inside decor handsome appealing and pretty much what I expected The bar area had some interesting lighting We were seated right away We were seated on the bistro type seats on the left when you first enter the dining room There is a bench on the wall and tables for 2 and 4 The other diners are fairly close by but not uncomfortably so One thing I found a little disconcerting some of the younger folks there were in T Shirts and Jeans The older couple seated on my right were wearing jeans and looking a little disheveled I had on the uniform khaki s blue dress shirt blue blazer We were seated then greeted by a server offering either sparkling or bottled water which I believe was an upsell over the tap water I just went for the bottled but I wasn t here to cheap out Our server was phenomenal Best service I ve had this year Ordered the B V Reserve Tapestry Vintage 2005 For Ruth s Chris version which was quite good and value priced at 50 Their wine list is both extensive and tends toward the expensive They provided good bread on the table For an appetizer I got the Wedge of Lettuce salad my server mentioned it was really for 2 but I wanted it Comes with Bacon and Blue Cheese crumbles I took half home for lunch today My wife had the Tomato and Mozzarella cheese appetizer Both were excellent My dinner was a perfectly cooked petite filet with creamed spinach and potatoes lyonnaise My wife had the veal chop with the two types of peppers Everything here was flawless Perfect timing perfect execution Dessert was berries with a custard creme which was very nice and I had a Grand Marnier to finish the night Price with a 50 bottle of wine and everything 200 left a 40 tip They are sensitive to the economy do check their value priced menu with appetizer entree and dessert its on the inside of the left cover of the menu Our waiter explained that option so I was pleased with that Bring the kids Maybe If you have a well behaved 10 year old who can hang for a high end paced dinner service yes Otherwise consider your fellow diners In summary a really nice high end night out not trendy or the latest hot new place but excellent food and service for the price point 
3ie9W4n9gOu-wKSOjBb-ag Princeton Easy to find and get to Plenty of parking spaces Good food Service was good Line was long Saturday night party of 3 at around 8PM waited about 1 hour Not as bad as Outback Realized later there was a sign that says Call ahead for waitlist Will try that next time Menu had lots of choices Salsa and Chips were good Margarita was good I had the Enchilada trio Good Note Everything was good but nothing was great or excellent Would I go again if invited but I don t think it would be the first place I would think of going to for dinner in the Edison area But that is the beauty of life being able to continue the search for the best food in each category throughout the world Andale Arriba Arriba 
3Ik3lLXuCHutBcoe9_06Mg Princeton I came here with a couple of teammates after the Mercer County Dragonboat Festival Almost everything else in the neighborhood was completely full or overpriced Granted to begin with we had a motley crew of just over 30 We had found seating at this seafood bistro that was far too expensive and then tried for a TGI Fridays that was too packed Then eight of us headed out for Chili s once we called and found out they had seating After finally finding the place we were seated and we were served drinks in a timely manner However the wait for the food was a bit too long I ordered a margarita grilled chicken with black beans and it was a little small for my appetite It was cooked well though I guess I should have ordered another side since I was still largely hungry The others ordered steaks burgers and wings They seemed to enjoy it though one of my friends who ordered a burger said it was too big to finish I guess we should ve swapped orders For what its worth it was overpiced The food was hardly filling and I remember shelling out 18 or so Service was too slow for my tastes and I regret paying with credit At least then I could have given them a lesser tip 
3Ik7Nlp0hYli1M_knVXRXA Princeton WHATTT I m giving this place 4 stars WHY cuz some of the waitresses there are just awesome and we go there mondays for MNF They give out sliders with fries during the kick off and half time The drinks are strong the waitresses are amusing and the tvs face the large table we reserve Its right by the marriott and other hotels in the area so def its worth going there We are a bit of a loud crowd but they are really nice to us The salad bar you can get to go for 8 or even make a meal out of the sliders The frozen drinks are great and they make a mean milkshake By far this is the best RT ive been to and they keep it clean and fast service 
3IT-z_2m3JPcbN6IjPdK-g Princeton Couple buddies went on a Saturday night Yes it was cramped but I rather be a little cramped then waiting for people to finish eating All three of us thought that our food was good just not spicy enough The service was decent and the prices are reasonable We were seated as soon as they made room for us We were promptly brought water but didn t see a server for five minutes At that point they wanted us to order The food was prompt and they consistently filled out glasses and brought us everything we wanted I thought the place is worthy of a repeat visit 
3J2wN8k3a85zMinnlGUYPw Princeton Slap your mama fresh Bent Spoon ice cream for dessert Bring extra bottle Can t miss Blue Point they have a Yelp Sticker on the door You go here and you realize just how long it has been since you ve really had good seafood These guys do it right with some 25 varieties of fish offered fresh in various forms of preparation on one side of the menu and appetizers ranging from Portuguese Sardines my first choice and of course no longer available to several versions of calamari and 16 types of raw oysters a seafood lovers paradise My girlfriend s pistachio crusted trout was amazing and huge I would not want to run into that sucker in a dark alley and it came with the best mashed sweet potatoes I ve ever had My Bouillabaisse was outstanding Their dessert menu had lot s of tempting options including fresh ice creams from the bent spoon http www yelp com biz the bent spoon princeton hrid 4oe0KcEnscAd 3k1fDuQWQ I say bring an extra bottle because it is BYO and they don t take reservations So get there early enjoy a few glasses while you wait and get ready for a great dinner I cast my price range vote at the with the warning that one could easily get over the 30 a person mark 
3Jlh0xY-h5aRISnjOy_a5w Princeton 5 for one slice of house pizza Rip off doesn t even begin to describe this 
3kP4YP0WWgc-eAkYzEcmPw Princeton My friends come here for the cheap margarita night but that s about it The bartender is always quick friendly and helpful The food is too expensive and boring The salad bar is okay but salad bars kind of gross me out so count me out of eating here for probably ever 
3L12KFmNzqxlnjAVc2MWIQ Princeton Went for brunch No reservation but they take phone call for you to request a table My friend called at noon and we got our table at 1 15 so shortened our wait by about 15mins I love the open kitchen in the middle of the dining floor Space is tight so be ready to sit close to your neighbors Got the Uovo pizza personal size with jalape o tomatoes and over easy eggs on top It is my brunch combo dream Thin crust and super crispy as if it is deep fried A few people on my table got the lasagna Bolognese and they all wiped their plates clean They use OGBF took us a while to figure out what it means org beef grass fed Ha Service is prompt and friendly Be ready to pay Manhattan price But I think it s worthed Negatives They serve only wine Princeton street parking can be a nightmare at times 
3MSW-KDXAgzZgjYA_AwY4g Princeton Fantastic find in Princeton Largest selection of fresh fish and oysters I have ever seen particularly for such an unassuming place Outdoor dining was great Service was exceptional Can t wait to go back 
3nAFyKsMVU7fhUVYRi7IFA Princeton As always in Princeton the food is expensive but bland and okay Expensive overrated nothing great Without the rich demographic in the Princeton area restaurants like Witherspoon Girl would never thrive 
3NgQfIq2GNKIRpSYZezkJA Princeton If you absolutely must eat Hoagie this place is FOR YOU Near cult following by the Princeton High School crowd and other Hoagie Haven junkies While you are there grab a few Hoagie Haven t shirts as presents LG XLG XXLG Cash only 
3NKwKwM9xe6l10dmXEfECQ Princeton I was craving Korean food and was too lazy to drive all the way up to Fort Lee NJ My friend heard about this place in Princeton that offers both Japanese and Korean cuisines Neither of us have been there so we decided to give it a shot Upon walking up to the place we saw some outdoor seating and some customers sitting outside The location is kind of hidden and not a prime location if I were the restaurant owner It was also not very busy for a Saturday night We were seated promptly and given glasses of iced water The iced water tasted like tap water and I immediately ordered some ice green tea to quench my thirst It was so hot outside The green tea was ok and tasted like it was from a powder mix The place has two eating rooms which would be good for small parties i suppose The service was pretty good and fast Besides the nice bathroom plenty of indoor and outdoor seating good service I have not much good things to say The food was ok but I felt the Korean cuisine all tasted the same The bulgogi had a lot of vegetables in it something i rarely see and the chap chae looked and tasted the same as the bulgogi dish we ordered except it had baby corn and vermicelli added to it The two dishes tasted pretty much the same I probably would never go back to eat their Korean food I think next time I ll have to drive up to Fort Lee as I know i wont be disappointed My friend had a raw fish salad that was supposedly pretty good I didn t try it as the Korean dishes were too disappointing I probably wouldn t bring any of my Korean friends here as i m sure they wouldn t like it The only Korean dish that looked authentic to me was the stone clay bibimbap i ordered I ve been to better Korean Japanese cuisine places and expected better from Princeton 
3nO2pTP-wl4eOlW9vnk1Cw Princeton Blue Point Grill is one of the best restaurants in Princeton and the Yelp reviews were spot on Most people reviewers liked Blue Point We did A couple people complained that it was noisy inside it was and delightful outside if the weather cooperates We sat outside between a German family pondering applying to Princeton and a family with Jersey Shore voices Nice touch of Americana The off the point reviewers were easy to filter They said you could buy fish cheaper at a fish market and cook it at home so they had to downgrade the place Well yes eating at home is cheaper BYOB is a benefit and it s as cheap as drinking at home Our waitress was articulate funny and made good suggestions Great fish well done not the cheapest night out we ve had but good value Blue Point Grill gets 4 stars because there are other places around the US that do it better and there s the noise inside Were this rated compared to the best of Princeton then 5 stars 
3o1TBu4pvCsJuMQf6VG-aw Princeton Excellent food excellent service Fish fish fish if you do not life fish go someplace else BYOB No reservations we came at 5 pm on Saturday and IT WAS CROWDED we walked by at 10 pm and there was room in between 5 pm and 10 pm it was hell if you did not have a seat already we did Definitely worth coming here for a good fish dinner Street parking good luck 
3O34kRWAcIu-EviL34urQg Princeton Another pedestrian Central NJ Diner The decor is decidely bland A measure of a diners food is the breakfast potatoes These were flavorless colorless and cold At least they didn t burn the toast 
3O3R8Jng_KWzejxjafAtjQ Princeton There aren t many places in the area that have an intimate atmosphere good food and where you can gorge for under 100 I always enjoy the sushi here as well as the curry shrimp dish It is very awesome that it s BYOB as well On the negative side the service is usually pretty inattentive I like that they don t rush you out but it is annoying when you need water napkins silverware or soy sauce and are forced to get up and take it from another table or stalk a server 
3OFz2_cQN3FQ0pPsJZS8Lw Princeton Certainly not a vegan shop but the owner was happy to chat about vegan soup options of which she always has at least one offering As a bonus the ingredients are listed right in plain sight I tried the tomato eggplant and it was delicious I don t even normally like eggplant Extra credit because the staff is very nice but be warned that they REALLY don t like when people use credit cards for small orders 
3okpTMEjupK0R5n4we3ZLQ Princeton 3 5 Stars Absoultely love the Haven Great sandwhiches for an even better price You really cant beat it for lunch or dinner and absoultely wonderful as a late night stop Service is quick and always perfect 
3Ops3p3vaRHIh2tQDDzowg Princeton I always had a craving for Joe s Crab ESPECIALLY after watching the countless commercials on their steampots The one where the people s hair are flying in a tornado So I came across this location closest to NY to try their seafood We had such a great time It reminded me of my trip a few summers ago to Daytona FL Our waiter stringed Let s Get Crackin bibs around us The waiters and waitresses perform a few dances to Cotton Eyed Joe Cha Cha Slide and other 80 s tunes which was pretty entertaining It s a very laid back and mellow atmosphere For some reason it was everyone s birthday About 8 cakes were brought out and announced to everyone while belting happy birthday tunes Unlike the typical dining leisure this place really brings out the relaxed and fun side of us We shared the Great Balls of Fire for an appetizer jalapeno shrimp and crab balls with cheddar sour cream was really good It also included a side of fries I had the Ragin Canjun steampot 1 pound of dungeness snow crabs shrimp potatoes fresh corn and sausage all spiced up cajun style My husband had the Key West Chicken glazed with mango jalapeno sauce with crabmeat and rice My sisters both shared the Bean TownBake for two 2 whole lobsters 1 pound of clams shrimp sausage fresh corn and sausage My brother had the Samuel Adam s Steampot 1 pound of Alaskian King Crab 1 pound shrimp potatoes fresh corn and sausage flavored in Samuel Adams and a bit of Old Baye seasoning In the end it was messy and good ole fun We were trading here and there to sample our steampots I think the overall experience is a lot better than Red Lobster More seafood and a table full of shells laughs For dessert we shared the Key Lime Pie w whipped cream and the Sea Turtle Sundae Chocolate cake a la mode topped with caramel and candied nuts Key Lime was definitely not as good or famous as Daytona but it did the job It s def worth checking out esp for a night out with friends or a casual birthday dinner 
3PBA9coAmCFrG26tiAC7Ow Princeton I go here all the time It s a great place to hang out with friends or to do some pleasure reading Not really enough room to do real work or have larger meetings though 
3psgEEaaWb_wuGXFtNwxoQ Princeton Will gladly pay what they are for pizza here Wonder why I hadn t tried this yet and called for Dominos twice Shame on me 
3PXBfwiqOYtqGx3rD-LvCA Princeton Recent glaring inconsistencies in the information provided by employees regarding available vegan options at P F Chang s has caused me to question their commitment to abiding by dietary restrictions I urge all diners to check with their server manager and even corporate before consuming anything questionable 
3Q8Q498L_RcPffrjdnlU3Q Princeton It was Sunday night and I wanted to try Italian one more try before giving up on NJ Italian forever Yeah I made fresh pasta every day in an NJ Fine dining restaurant for a few months so I have high standards Initially we wanted to go to Eno Terra however it was booked out The atmosphere is nice decor is welcoming the menu also looked very good and varied while being cohesive There were spanish portuguese influenced dishes as well as very Mediterranean dishes but nothing WAYYY out there We had a party of 7 We shared all our appetizers Mussels Shallot garlic cream saffron tasty sauce mussels get cold really quickly so they got to our table sort of warm but they were cooked well and pretty plump not over Dipped tons of bread in the sauce Octopus salad Tiny fried potatoes capers nicoise olives paprika and a bit of octopus It was tasty but capers olives salty briney as hell and there was WAYYY too much of it for the rest of the dish Lost some stars here Bruschetta Terrible Bread was fat the house bread smeared with pepperonata which tasted bland and old and just soggy and boring Little quenelle attempt of ricotta with a leaf of parsley on top didn t save the dish Thick soggy old bread with tasteless crap on top Yellowfin cevichle Not bad Fish wasn t too oxidize old fresh tasting and well seasoned Red onion and peppers were cut very irregularly should have been a simple tighter brunoise or an uniform small dice at LEAST Looked like a mess but tasted pretty good Buffalo Mozzarella Very tasty Seemed like fresh housemade mozzarella too Blanched broccoli rabe roasted red pepper seemed jarred but still tasty and a nice vinaigrette Very tasty dish Entrees 12 oz ribeye with truffle butter falafel cauliflower gratin Ribeye was really thin unfortunately but still well seasoned and flavorful The thing was probably mid rare but it rested to almost a medium well unfortunate The falafel tasted good but seemed out of place and the cauli gratin lacked seasoning Salt cheese cream all lacking Bland as hell Osso Bucco Served with Couscous and dried apricots almonds and herbs VERY nice dish Fresh and very tasty osso bucco Almond Crusted Merloza Didn t taste much of this one but it looked good but relative to everything else it was a small portion The fish was very cod like Well seasoned Salmon Pan seared on one side ovened and finished with a salsa of sorts Very flavorful and served with potatoes whipped with some nut and stone fruit similar to the osso bucco Nice dish Well cooked salmon Scallops 3 Hefty 1 5 2 oz scallops which were cooked and seasoned VERY well However the cauliflower puree was cold and crappily plated over some wilted romaine or something but it had a nice cold but very well seasoned lentil salad Also a few parsnip chips which were done quite well Nice dish needs re thinking on the puree Pastas Orrechiette tasty shell pasta with housemade sausage and other things Not bad at all my younger brother finished it all Fettucine seemed pretty fresh The pasta had a few noodles that were stuck together so it seemed like freshly boiled and slightly oxidized in color which made me feel like it was fresh made maybe 2 days old though Good bite to the pasta itself but could have used more salt The entire dish was a mess though Slightly overcooked haricot verts chunks of canned tomato tough to chew braised short rib it was tasty but I only had like 4 5 bites and I m a BIG EATER Disappointing Desserts All desserts came with a sorbet or ice cream which was freshly made in house I liked that The Marscapone cheesecake was REALLY nice with strawberries and a jam lemon sorbet Pear Tart had a great crust but was not as tasty as I had hoped Baklava which was tasty and a honey sugary mess as baklava often is All in all not a bad spot Good decor decent but inconsistent food some dishes being well thought but others just really really shitty Going to try Eno Terra next 
3qGzhMQxtrgTONJ7urb7sg Princeton Delicious pizza in an relaxed laid back atmosphere Best of all they have a bar so you re able to properly enjoy what I think is the best pairing in the world pizza and beer Went here for my birthday with several friends last night My initial choice for the evening was Nomad but with our larger group 12 my friend suggested Contes For a Saturday night and with a large group we didn t have to wait too long As a newb I didn t realize that you had to order before you were seated maybe because it was Saturday so that delayed us putting in an order getting seated as the waitress didn t come back for another 5 minutes after leaving us They have Peroni beer which I adore We ended up by the end of the night with 5 pizzas and many many beers and glasses of wine We got a plain pepproni sausage and mushroom pepperoni and mushroom and peppers and onion The pie is reminiscent of one of my favorite bar pies from North Jersey Star Tavern Among 12 people our total bill before tip they made sure to tell us that tip wasn t included was around 288 bucks We also ended up staying up to 10 30 and there were a couple of other patrons around It s a great place for a casual dinner especially if you have a bunch of people they are pretty accommodating 
3RG4H8jKwfd4-x8LF-5JtA Princeton beer is good get the honey wheat only thing is they use to have a really good bar menu but they changed it nothing is good i hope they realize this and bring back some of the old items At least they didn t get rid of the Triumph Burger which is pretty good 
3rGB_6KQMd1FE5NF84gkzQ Princeton Coffee made with love is something that will get me to drop 5 on a latte Small World Coffee serves their coffee with a dash of love in every cup It s fun it s funky it s fresh it s local and it s worth every penny I was surprised and delighted by the details they took care to see if we wanted to have our order to stay or to do I was served an iced latte in a glass cup it was like home but better because I didn t spill coffee grinds everywhere The facilities were clean the baristas were really friendly and practice safe food handling and the coffee was great If I were to move to the Princeton area this would be a go to coffee shop for people watching caffeinating getting work done and having a coffee filled home away from home 
3RZHRu1KagDi772IqsjgxA Princeton I m not sure when this place actually closes as they are always open and PACKED after the bars let out at 2am Fast cheap and delicious are the ways best to describe Hoagie Haven especially if you re here with the after 2am crowd Definitely nothing wrong with this place highly recommended 
3Sj3S0kBXZCiqFlMQPZY-Q Princeton Restaurant is very dark tho the candlelight ambiance is nice Waitstaff seems unenthused and sometimes annoyed but were attentive enough Food came out slow for early evening on a Monday Food is all right but definitely overpriced Silverware was dirty 
3Sw-wIf_prlf-CMQjLSq2g Princeton Go to diner type place in Princeton The place used to be more fun when the writing was all over the walls tables and ceiling The fun giant sized breakfast characters were awesome There was a renovation and all that charm was erased I ve been back once since that happened and it s not the same for me The food is good but it was the ambiance that made it fun 
3tDpVbX5---dS1HWWjUz4g Princeton My first time here for a quick bite to eat with my 3 year old Adorable place Huge Tons to pick from We had silician slice and I haven t had silician pizza in years but I will be having it again soon It was SOOO good and crunchy crust and hot Its nice they have tables inside to sit at for a few minutes Will definately be back again 
3ThNQHRZRRQG3MvrFbZ7sA Princeton Great food eh service I ve never had a bad meal at this location or the Edison spot I love the Fried Pearl Noodles Pad Thai and Chow Fun I keep going back for the delicious food Service is never consistent Sometimes they give us a hard time about taking credit card payment they don t come to take our order within a reasonable amount of time 15 minutes is long for people on lunch and more than once my food or my friend s food came out and the other person sat waiting for more than 10 minutes Then there are times when everything goes smoothly Go figure Princeton s service is not nearly as bad as what I experienced in Edison 
3UAvFj8F4fkfd41AGl8fmw Princeton I ve been here thrice The food comes quickly and tastes real fine there seem to be many negative reviews on this site but i like this restaurant YAY I m a fan 
3Ue5ll4X-l82KN7iZexOEQ Princeton I love eating here so much The food is really authentic and the price point is awesome The dimsum is delicious Since I m chinese I know that this place is super authentic Also service there is really nice as well It is a place I go with my friends all the time The food is just so amazing Last time my friend and I got MUSHU meat in a wrap Trust me It is to die for Best chinese food around here Go give it a try you won t regret it 
3UJFNOzsWaoed8OgHH0o-Q Princeton my thoughts on eating sukiyaki if you are as hard on your liver as I try to be sukiyaki is a great hangover cure infact i think it might cure everything you can eat it before an exam and after a party you can eat it when you re sad and it will make you happy you can eat it when you re happy and you ll be nourished you can eat it with friends you can eat it alone and feel like you have a friend lovely service fresh ingredients this place would not get five stars for gourmet flava flave in san francisco but in princeton it is my sukiyaki staple 
3URG0ct2E6Mkquh-S_TpqA Princeton Open late huge menu good prices good food My wife and I have started to eat here often since moving to the area and always enjoy our meals ok I didn t like my pancakes that much there but my wife thought they were good Our only real disappointment has been with the mousse based desserts They aren t bad just not great The sandwiches burgers and french onion soup are all excellent and I am looking forward to trying the Greek and some liver and onions Some of the best french fries you will have and a nice coleslaw as well The staff is friendly and the owner manager is almost always there making sure you are taken care of 
3V-0DeGrQzskInXCn1gPvg Princeton A lunch staple in Princeton you can always find a good burger sandwich or salad on the menu Sometimes the specials are hit or miss Not bad for after work either spacious enough bar to hang with some friends and have a drink It can get crowded at times so you may have to wait for a table 
3vdpJeWBvfn6sTVWd4kjug Princeton I d give this place a 3 5 so I optioned up The place is gorgeous and service is excellent We were there for a company dinner and were able to try most of the appetizers and a lot of the red sangria Sangria Mild but good I m used to a more potent blend but was thankful that it wasn t as we were on company time We had our own room in the back which was beautifully lit warm and inviting Bread basket all were perfect We alternated between the baguettes and italian bread slices but also loved the crostini Charcuterie plate Yummy although the meat slices were odd The chorizo should have been in smaller cuts the ones we had were 1 x10 slices and the jamon was too thick as it s drier than prosciutto it really has to be sliced ultra thin Appetizer salad this had fennel blue cheese figs and a few other items No one touched it until the others were gone but then we devoured it Hummus spreads plate one of the other guests mentioned that it was the best hummus he had ever had The olives on all of the plates were excellent Pork rilette shredded pork confit served with crostini which was divine Terribly rich but oh so good Then the mini casserole with chickpeas garbanzo beans duck and a few other tastes rich and lovely My husband ordered the whole red snapper and was offered with or without head and tail he got it with both but it was served de boned It was so perfectly cooked that we were surprised that the fingerling potatoes it sat on were under cooked If you are adventurous try the tip of the fins or tail it s nice Crunchy and flavourful Just don t go too far as then it s just indigestible bones I opted for the Pinchos and Oysters The oysters were salty Not saline or buttery just salty It tasted as though they salted them which is so unnecessary and was a bit much for me The mignonette was a bit too sweet also The pinchos were the most beautiful I had ever seen served on knotted bamboo skewers The shrimp abolutely perfect and with a mild tang from the balsamic vinagre The beef incredible The Griggs chicken Tough and dry I was disappointed as I had wanted to try the chicken from the various Griggs farms town boroughs etc The dining experience was professional and even even with a few disappointments All 12 of us were served at the same time with hot food When drinks were needed it took no more than 5 8 minutes Presentation was amazing everything looked so pretty as though it was prepared for a photo shoot So yes although I adore barbeque and fisherman s platters served on styrofoam wish it were paper I too can be swayed by picture perfect servings yummy food and excellent service Some quality control is needed or at least when it comes to the chicken and the jamon but they did a great job 
3VZrUmSRW5QopcZwJ5F66w Princeton I happen to really like this place When my boyfriend lived in Princeton this was our go to spot We tend to eat vegetarian here so I can t really comment on the meat end of things But the red curry mango tofu have never let me down the tom kah gai is usually decent the service is quick and maybe I m used to surly living in Philly and the prices are cheap They accommodate groups and don t care how much alcohol you bring in Also nice plus the bathrooms are always clean 
3wVSp7-aKwTG2q2lIQgMcA Princeton What can I say Masala Grill is my temple for Indian cuisine I ve never had a bad meal here and my wife and I eat there on a regular basis I would recommend the weekend lunch buffet which offers a bounty of unusual dishes that most would not usually order when out to dinner And that is essentially why I love Masala Grill Their menu offers diners something different in order to capture the true essence of Indian cuisine Everyone starts w Chicken Masala when they first try Indian food That is A But why not go to Z If you want to find out what is between A and Z eat at Masala Grill 
3xvBHjZdQL4ZGbcqnjsh6w Princeton I went through this phase where I thought I didn t like Korean food I think it stems from a bad experience I had at a Korean BBQ place a few years ago Then recently my cousin suggesting going out for Korean food Though I was hesitant I decided to go along with it b c I m not really a picky eater And despite that previous bad experience I still loved kimchi Then I discovered what I had been missing Needless to say I m no Korean BBQ expert However I loved my meal at Nassau Sushi I m giving it a high rating because it s was good value 60 for enough food for four people Korean food tends to be on the expensive side and I do think it s because the entrees absorb the costs of all those complimentary little plates they put out As Nassau Sushi they only put out three little plates which is fine by me plus a miso soup The soup is very tasty but the mellow flavors don t really mesh well with the zing of Korean food so I would drink the soup first and then move on to the apps instead of nibbling here and sipping there Korean food isn t veggie friendly pick another place if you re going out with your veggie friends We tried the bulgogi which some of the most flavorful beef I ve ever tasted Next was the kimchi bokum bob As one of the other reviewers mentioned there wasn t much beef or kimchi to be seen and it s not served in a stone pot but still it was so good We also had one of the stews which wasn t as great and a pork dish which was really good 
3z2Xp91eqA-oTtk1xxRTQw Princeton What a disappointment We decided to stop in and try some beer and perhaps grab a bite to eat We sat at the bar on the lower level and the barmaid could not have been less interested I ordered the Honey Blond and my BF ordered something different I don t remember what and he stepped out for a moment The beers were dropped in front of me and before I could even ask for a menu Caitlin high tailed it back to the boys at other end of the bar The only reason I know her name is because it s on the receipt I was kind of hungry at this point of the day and now pissed off at the lack of service so we paid for our beers and left The beer wasn t even that great I m no beer snob either But I know what honey tastes like and it wasn t in whatever beer I was poured 
3zanGf8YifdUzEFHDnPAgA Princeton Stay far far away from this place if you are looking for a venue for an event The management is rude and will dishonor your contract to save a few bucks here and there So it doesn t matter what you have written on your contract they will do what they want and when you call them out on it they have nothing to say and no way to compensate you for anything Instead of apologizing like a normal professional business would they make you feel as if you are the one that has done something wrong Not worth the hassle Never again 
3zKTitn3MbY5h86Y_spHKA Princeton Just went to PF Changs again last night and I have to say the food was tasty This place is crazy busy all the time and thank goodness that there always seems to be room at the bar My favorite item on their menu is the chicken lettuce wraps and the staff is always very attentive and friendly 
3zYV7F-VEPn-V-2cjLJgTw Princeton I had the same experience this past Saturday night when we happened in at about six The hostess told us the wait was an hour and a half As we said no thanks and turned to leave she yelled out Just so you know if you want to come back on a Friday or Saturday night you need a reservation Very loud and very rude 
3Z_0sdOCWOrM7iCkiEzSgw Princeton I don t know much anything about beer but the reviewers here are being way too tough on the food I think it s great and I ve been to Triumph with a variety of different groups at least a dozen times over the years and am ALWAYS quite satisfied All the appetizers are super scrumptious I have enjoyed the fried calamari and the little pizza thing I forget what its called many times I ve had pretty good burgers and oh yes some truly excellent fancy style mac and cheese I don t think it was on the menu I was just hankerin and I asked and they made my dreams come true The service is ok the place looks cool with towering ceilings huge metal vats o brewin and an extremely long narrow shape it used to be a bowling alley Once I m 21 for a while I ll be able to assess the beer and barness of the place but from the looks of it it s not the best place for meeting nice normal peoples just come for some good moderately priced food and get the beer sampler that thing looks like fun 
3_p6szBWKQl9O0fKKa9QUQ Princeton Had a group of 7 people and the service was good I like the atmosphere of the place especially the HUGE fireplace at the back of the room Nice to sit around with a cold beer and good conversation Discliamer Food is a subjective thing like art What appeals to me may not appeal to you If something I ve written intrigues you take a shot and give a place the benefit of the doubt You probably won t be disappointed The food varied in quality I started with the French onion soup Nothing remarkable but good I could get the same soup in the same bowl at a hundred different restaurants The big hearty burger was char grilled a big plus and is a generous portion It was cooked exactly as i requested was crusty juicy meaty and well dressed An 8 on a scale of 10 I asked for grilled onions and should have been more descriptive as I got sauteed sweated onions Caramelization on the onions would have provided deeper level of flavor and probably a higher rating The Nassau chicken wings were average not great but certainly not bad Wasn t a fan of the dominant Worcestershire flavor in the Buffalo style and the BBQ wings were a little too gloppy Portions were generous The sweet potato fries were good a little on the thin side and if a thicker cut had been used would have made the fluffy inside that much better Lastly desert was good We split the pumpkin bread pudding cranberry apple crisp and the butterscotch pumpkin shooters All were very good I travel to Princeton at least once a year and would go to the YDTR if I craved a burger a cold beer and a warm fire So long from Texas 
4-qXPZ8isPRGKKOHsQ7xag Princeton Small World has been around for quite some time and for good reason they serve great coffee Desserts and snacks are also available any time of the day but they re a little too pricey for my taste I knocked off a star because they don t take credit cards C mon who doesn t take credit cards these days 
4-sVtg7bG302uR21pUgp6Q Princeton First time I went here was in Virginia either Chesapeake Virgina Beach or Norfolk Either way it was really good Tried the one in Jersey first time I went the wait was insane and my sister and I had to leave The second time I went we went early got seated and enjoyed ourselves The steam pots are delicious Been here a few times since food is always great but I only get the steam pots 
417HSKDniNAp9wDwx1AzCw Princeton Okay I haven t tried the wings but this is the place to get the best philly cheese steak and chilli dog in Princeton And for cheap prices which can t be said of any other eatery in all of Pton I also just heard the story about the Menendez brothers owning the place Apparently they bought it with the inheritance money they collected after their parents died i e after they killed their parents The reason they bought Chuck s is that the place was THE hangout and they wanted the pride of making it their own Excellent stories make food taste better so I can t wait for my next visit to Chuck s 
43N24323AGlOp0_yDlxfug Princeton 12 31 2011 Lousy service inhospitable staff and incompetent management I told the bartender I wanted to buy a drink for two friends before happy hour was over expecting to pay the happy hour price The bartender never said anything and charged me the full price for the drinks Upon my protest he corrected the problem but his attitude was the issue His attitude conveyed to me that I was a pain in in the a On another occasion I ordered a steak The steak was very good and should be for the price but I had to ask for salt and pepper Problem is I was half way through my steak before the sever got around to bringing the salt and pepper Any decently trained server would ask upon serving the food is there anything else you would would like Or would immediately recognize that they didn t bother to set a proper table or provide the most basic service Management doesn t bother to train the staff in the basics Beyond that the staff lacks any sense of friendliness and of being in the hospitality business Again it s a management issue At the end of my meal I asked for the check which I paid for in cash The server gives me what I thought was a receipt however when I looked closer it said balance due I called the server and the manager Elaina over to discuss the error I asked the server in the managers presence Did I pay the check To which he replied Yes So why does my receipt say Balance due Neither the manager or the server apologized for the error but again treated me like I was a pan in the a and they were annoyed that I should even bring their error to their attention Without immediate staff and management changes and improvements I think they ll be out of business in less than 6 months 
43TjzxqXsinOJryWwTC86Q Princeton Good dishes Crab Rangoon crab cheese mix is pretty tasty Double Sauteed Pork spicy pork very tender Also has mushroom green pepper cabbage Beef with Snow Peas and Mushroom beef is tender flavor is nice with the snow peas and mushroom Shredded Pork with Bean Curd my favorite dish and very cheap for lunch special It s dry bean curd dofu gan in chinese with pork Also has green peppers onions and scallions Amazing flavor Beef Stew Noodle Soup spicy Beef nice and tender Soup broth is delicious General Tso Sesame Chicken both comes with 3 pieces of brocolli Great for pairing up with another dish that has veggies I d stay away from Mapo Tofu way too much MSG Hunan Beef weird flavor and Chinese Curry Chicken nothing like Japanese or Indian curry Just weird in general I wouldn t say Ivy Garden or Tiger Noodles is strictly better than the other Both have their specialities and you need to figure out what s good for each 
45hMGIavhpLmRLbHX01NyQ Princeton Pros excellent margaritas the food is decent and consistent between visits Cons quality of service is unpredictable and sloooooow bathrooms are often unacceptable Avoid them at all costs In short I do occasionally enjoy OTB especially when I know they won t be busy 
467dy_Pa5aEMcAUauYdzjg Princeton I come to Mediterra every few weeks and sit at the bar which is always great the bartenders Byron Jose are attentive and friendly I recently met the bartender Tony who is also a great asset to Mediterra I ate in the dining room last week on a first date and was almost as happy as I am at the bar I ordered the squid ink pasta which looked much better than it tasted It was cooked perfectly but the sauce was just bland Our server wasn t very attentive my date had to ask for water when there was none left in the glass she didn t check back after the food was delivered for quite some time and I was waiting to ask for salt and pepper to give my food some flavor we were given dessert menus then watched our server walk by several times before coming back to see if we were interested little things like that nothing bad enough to ruin the night Three stars for the bar atmosphere their wine list is great I enjoy their tapas at the bar 
46Acd9WJxTNqbYKU_o_kzw Princeton The food was excellent It seemed fresh and tasty I would strongly recommend this restaurant 
46svN1vFGvaXj0tpSJ4_fw Princeton I was a bit saddened when I heard it was closing but I ll write my thoughts anyway I felt the restaurant was solid but French themed anything seems questionable anymore in NJ From food to wine people in NJ seem to avoid anything French probably for the wrong reasons On one occasion I had a special dinner with Eric Dunham winemaker from WA and felt extremely pleased with my overall dining experience That was a one of a kind intimate experience with special attention paid to us When I went for a visit with my other half the service was not sharp but the food was great They went French American at some point but I feel like they needed something more Joe Christen is a super nice guy and I wish things would ve worked out better 
47MWenlwxu6mfaOXUH5ZBQ Princeton The best Chinese in the area hands down Sesame chicken spinach fried wontons bliss My only complaint is that they don t deliver to Hoboken 
47oT1UFIgZaGoEr6zz3PYw Princeton I ve been eating at PF Chang s all over the country for last 15 years including the Princeton establishment since it opened a few years ago I was there this week and shocked to see their portions which seemed to have reduced to less than half of its original dinner portions The portions were significantly smaller for everyone in our group They had also skimped on the sauces and the plates almost looked empty Incidentally the prices remain around the same or gone up a bit I understand restaurants have to cope up with rising prices but food service business is competitive and there are many other fine Asian restaurants in the area including Elements of Asia which still serves excellent food at 10 15 lower prices and without skimping out on the portions 
48EdbDuPuUGSCyOg__lsIg Princeton Gyro Extra tzatiki Yum 
490lxmXH3JDSKw3Ci2qgRA Princeton It is definitely one of the good places in Princeton Princeton does not have good Chinese restaurants at all I am sorry to say that So when we missed Chinese food we used to go to Penang though it is not a Chinese restaurant Clean good service and good food Good for a group too 
4AVHbSUgoWs8uFA6MSt0Xg Princeton When I lived in Princeton this was by far my favorite Indian place for dinner much better than Kalluri Corner down the road I stopped by this weekend for the lunch buffet 9 95 which is an incredible deal Aside from the usual assortment of pakoras veggie paneer and meat curries and desserts this includes fresh buttered naan baked in the kitchen and brought out to order as opposed to the dried out naan sitting in a tray The level of spiciness for the buffet is probably at a the tail end of medium I have low tolerance for spicy food and this was about all I could handle I did like the saag corn though kind of random but surprisingly tasty My chief complaint was the deceptive placement of mango lassi servings in the buffet as it turns out those cost an extra 2 50 they were nicely done though thick smooth creamy and not too sweet Also I only had one plate full but for some reason I was sooo stuffed that I had to skip dinner that night Bleh Tip There s a to go basement shop under the main restaurant you can get a lunch box featuring either veggie or meat curries and rice On sunny days it s a great place to pick up a bite to eat outside Tip 2 You get a 10 student discount here 
4bPnurWrUaimomNTzBp_fQ Princeton Seriously don t come here for brunch with a group of 5 it is an awkward number they do not know how to accommodate for and you will be waiting in the cold for 45 minutes with an impatient hungry father pacing the block Once inside the service was quick and our coffee cups stayed full The food was satisfying but no wow factor mom makes pancakes just as good Brother branched out and got jueves rancheros that was a mistake Stick to the basics here 
4BzH5ocC4YIFZ-lcY4Wahw Princeton As I m writing this I m realizing the difficulty that it will be to do justice to the wonderful gem that is Olive s Located conveniently on Witherspoon just a half block down from the University s main gates but kids remember not to walk out of the gates until you ve graduated Olive s fed me so well throughout my college years First and foremost one of the best chocolate chip cookies I ve ever tasted I am convinced they are laced with crack or some other highly addictive substance The perfect softness in the middle with toasty edges and gooey chocolate chips to this day I CRAVE Olive s There were times when I would wait 20 minutes for a fresh batch to come out When I went to reunions I literally bought like 4 cookies to last me through the weekend And they re BIG cookies too A perfect morsel of food What else great salads and sandwiches Great hummus Amazing cupcakes breads and baked goods Their cupcake designs were always so fanciful and colorful and changed with the seasons Halloween cupcakes Springtime flowery cupcakes Orange and black welcome back alumni cupcakes Very creative And delicious The store has doubled in size since I was in college which is a nice change for sure Always my first stop back in Princeton 
4d83tqNcyK1N_CSHxtTALw Princeton Whenever we don t feel like cooking we get takeout from Crown of India We ve gotten their food maybe once a month for the past year Always hot big portions and tasty The naan is good My MIL and I love the rice We usually get the Aloo Gobi and Saag Paneer These dishes are not AMAZING but definitely good enough that we get Crown of India cravings every once in a while that no other takeout can satisfy I would recommend this place to others Getting a dish from there is like settling into a warm dish of comfort food Indian style 
4Dfir1GKxbjpZDzKEYjmKg Princeton The restaurant is gorgeous the food delectable the atmosphere romantic I went for Valentine s Day and the service was way too slow but I will try again on a non holiday I hated my server he was yelling across the room to people and cursing and looking down my dress So NOT the dining experience I was expecting 
4E5SBxBxqqD2lVXtsudYvA Princeton Totally delicious Although I am you don t have to be a vegetarian to enjoy the food here I ve come here with non veggies and they ve been really pleased with their meals I seriously dream of their hot and sour soup its the best soup I think I ve ever had very spicy and a really exotic mix of mushrooms and its really filling so you may want to split an entree or just stick with another app this coming from someone who can usually ALWAYS clear her plate Another fav is the stir fried spinach linguine and their guac is so good I get a to go portion of it to bring home for 3 Its BYOB which is sweet although buy a bottle before resorting to the wine store next door which is crazy overpriced 
4eirGiN-V--ncfbNMD3oDQ Princeton This place has seriously gone downhill My family has been coming here for years usually for events that are worth celebrating but don t warrant a party like a birthday that falls on a Wednesday Standbys like the roti canai and chili chicken are still great However Everything else is just no good anymore Especially the fish keep well away if you value a settled stomach 
4EnLofI4bVtoanr05i1W-w Princeton By signing up on the Quiznos website I received a coupon to print the store locator confirmed that the location would accept it The lady who began preparations on my sandwich was very pleasant albeit extremely stingy with the ingredients I ordered a veggie no cheese and watched stupefied as she sprinkled veritable crumbs of onions and mushrooms onto the bread The woman who completed preparing my sandwich was worse it was actually amusing to watch her try to spread a thimble full of guacamole on my otherwise barren sandwich When it came time to pay the second person eyed my coupon warily I handed it to her and she told me that they don t accept copies Although I explained that the coupon was a printout of an email I had received less than an hour prior she continued to insist that they don t accept copies holding up a coupon from a mailer as an example of what she would accept I tried one final time to explain before I realized I was begging to purchase an over priced empty sandwich from a shop that had absolutely no interest in my business I layed my chips on the counter told her to keep the sandwich and the coupon and proceeded to drive out of my way to a Subway where I received superior service and product at a lower price even without a coupon I have no way of knowing if all Quiznos would offer a similarly horrendous experience but this leaves me no reason to test the theory 
4eT2IXMBavyviRFwIPZGWw Princeton It might have been the bread or some other kind of magical ingredient it was really great bread though but they somehow made the cheese hoagie I shared with a vegetarian worth my while WOW that was good bread 
4FiB_B5-43yxVFcwxwl4Fw Princeton Went there on a date and Indian was exactly what we were craving on a brisk autumn night She had the chicken makhani and I had the lamb rogan josh and the dishes were great the meat was tender and the curries they were prepared in were so deep and rich in flavor The servers were so nice to us and were very attentive I ve also been there during the week for business lunch and their buffet is fantastic I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the the Mercer County area looking for authentic Indian cuisine 
4fTVAKcvWKVF1eiJiA5OEA Princeton I have to concer with Angela Z s review It looks like your typical Chinese take out with the same furniture paper menus and set up that about a million other places have These places must be sold as a start your own restaurant kit One thing I did notice the first time walking in however was how clean the place was I ve been to about a million take out places where they usually don t care about the dining area since most of there customers are carry out or delivery You can tell however that this place seemed to care a bit more The food on the other hand is excellent I tried the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce The shrimps were nice and large tasted fresh and were not overcooked The sauce had the right consistency not watered down and the rice was excellent The egg drop soup and fried won tons were excellent as well The portions are large and the prices are great The combo platters are especially a great deal This is probably not the place to go if you want to impress a date but if you are hungry and are looking for good food this place is it 
4grgsJuljXDiDlSj9GnFRA Princeton Order the Roti Canai delish if you are gluten free just don t eat the yummy pancake roti to dip in the great sauce The Yellow Mee like Laksa is also delicious and you can order it with rice noodles instead of egg for my GF freinds The Beef Rendang is a huge serving delicious and falls apart but you are going to want to share this with someone While the service isn t always fabulous the food is some of the most authentic in the US I would recommend it 
4gV7duZcG9ZhK78h7lfvAQ Princeton Trepiani was terrific The food was very good but more importantly the service and the general attitude of all was warm and welcoming We were running late for our dinner res and called and they were extremely accomodating I would definitely recommend this place 
4hG4suZWHbD7_TAC5M3I3w Princeton Dropped by this place intrigued by the Eastern European Food ad Most foods seem Bulgarian or Greek I had the Tsatsiki salad which was very yummy and served very nicely Then I had the Chicken and Spinach Crepe which was extremely good The atmosphere was very nice the service friendly and quick the food yummy I definitely recommend this place 
4hR1CNM0_rrrSgW3cEzxug Princeton I love Mediterra Everything about it exudes classic dining in a casual chic atmosphere However one night we had terrible service we knew it was a fluke but thought to mention it to the manager Not only was he gracious and profoundly apolgetic he remebered us the following week to say he took care of us was an understatement He went above and beyond personally seating us in one of the best spots covering all food and drink truly making us feel welcome satisfied and grateful for our patronage I highly recommend Mediterra to anyone and everyone Fabulous as always JJ 
4HRrRGuUyjqTFfBgGYw6oQ Princeton Average Sushi for a high price I ordered the spicy salmon spicy tuna and yellow tail I don t think a sushi place should mess those up but they did The spicy was not even spicy The rolls had very little fish inside and were masked by tons of rice The Edamame was wilty and gross The only good thing is its a BYOB I will not return unless I m super hungry and there is nothing else to eat in Princeton 
4HtFM3BEhWPssEmxaKAaQA Princeton Good brews good steak 
4IgaxjBPgAmpnNOh8NzB7g Princeton Probably the diviest bar in Princeton so it s a nice change of pace from the usual scene Very hit or miss some nights are a lot of fun and sometimes it s just kinda slow and quiet 
4imdeR2jLFNCh8vbDJBqhQ Princeton Mmmm the perfect place for average food Granted that Tiger s Tale isn t a gourmet restaurant that uses high quality fresh ingredients the Tiger s Tale is a great place to grab a quick lunch with co workers or friends I ve been here a few times and I would have to say that the Lobster Roll is my favorite Fresh and light the lobster roll is a great dish for a good price This wouldn t necessarily be my first choice restaurant but I would say that the food is tasty the prices are reasonable and that it s ALWAYS packed I guess that says something right 
4iwsUE2MPFZbRf5vChLoBA Princeton A friend of ours lives in Plainsboro so we decided to go here after a movie one night I see mixed reviews for this place based on the food and it s service Let me give you my opinion Food The food was slightly above average I went there with a Chinese girl who knows her authentic food and she said that it was pretty good and had some menu items that are usually not seen in other Chinese restaurants We would give it a solid 7 on the taste scale Service here is where they out shined other restaurants I don t know if it s because they re aware of the negative feedback on Yelp or they just have genuinely nice servers but our guy was very attentive and friendly during the course of our dinner He even recommended some of the dishes Kudos for that Bottom line When we re in the area again we ll go back 
4IzUT31SX0HCb_eya3OOYg Princeton This place is in the space formerly occupied by Ichiban across from the library A 3 5 but I really liked the experience so bumped it to a 4 The name really sums up the experience it s peaceful The interiour was refurbished and although it s in the same arrangement it looks and feels completely different Serene I will definitely be heading back There also weren t any air circulation problems which was an issue with the previous place Did I mention that it was soothing I didn t hear a water fountain but it felt as though one was there We stopped in for lunch today and as I ve already mentioned loved the atmosphere Princeton needed an upscale Japanese restaurant tea room There s also outdoor seating with a gong Within a few seconds of arriving we were directed to a seat of our choice and took the corner There s bench seating against the wall which is great for groups Jim ordered a green bubble tea which was good and filled with tapioca and bean bubbles and which was brought out quickly For lunch we decided to split a couple of things Shrimp tempura appetizer light and super crunchy but bit oily The shrimp was plump and succulent and required at least 3 bites yeah There was also a spinach like leaf that was tempuraed and great in addition to snow peas and zucchini As decoration was a cute pile of julienned and fried sweet potatoes Duck salad this was our least favourite item The duck was more like jerky and the sauce had a pungent fermented vinegar in addition to the fish sauce a bit much for us More fresh mint would have been welcomed as the bite I had with the mint sprigs was perfect The produce was fresh and crisp too Princeton Roll a tall tower with mild smoked salmon salmon eggs sweet and tender unagi sliced avocado and 3 flavours of tamago Next time I ll ask for it without the cream cheese Spicy Tuna Handroll Obviously I couldn t try this although Jim was impressed enough that he wanted me to Um sweetie point at belly OH Unlike some places which serve it bright orange from too much sriracha this one appeared to simply have a lot of minced tuna spiced and happily rolled into a cone At the end of the meal the owner stopped by to chit chat and see how everything was They really want this place to also be a tea house and serve organic teas including the blossoming variety in clear pots I really can t wait to go back The service was pleasant and prompt and welcoming Nassau Sushi could learn something from this place Lunch including tax but prior to tip 34 
4J5mZLqNilgBWMOLoNTbMg Princeton I went here for the lunch buffet Once Not doing that again It was two years ago maybe things have gotten better since then I don t know how it compares to Mehek or Tandoori Bite or the other places in Princeton proper because ever since I got a car I just go to Franklin Park and if you have a car I recommend you do the same 
4J7SWfK4JpOOzfqigqPpBg Princeton oh my god i don t know why people love this place price is ridiculously high for the service and the quality they have It took me almost 10 minutes to drink my coffee They made my first drink wrong and they gave me an attitude when I asked them to remake my drink Second drink came 5 minutes later because they had to make other people s order first REALLY My latte taste bitter and burned as well i didn t bother to ask them to remake my drink again They can t make good coffee I went to starbucks instead MUCH MUCH BETTER service and drinks 
4jcV886uARBsULvOQlbOkw Princeton Big menu of fusion items The green curry was a little heavy on the coconut milk but every place has it s own version of green curry so that was fine Nice variety of fresh vegetables all cut to pretty much the same size for a nice presentation and ease of eating The sushi was very good cut into just the right size so that you can taste the fish without being overwhelmed and not too much rice Rolls were wrapped up very neatly and again perfect amount of rice paired with properly portioned fish enjoyable sushi experience They also have uni on occasion when they can get it fresh Staff is super friendly and very attentive though both times I went it wasn t crowded so your mileage may vary It seems that they all speak English so communication or questions about ingredients are not a problem If I had one complaint it would be the bubble tea I went for the taro and while pretty good maybe a tad sweet for my tastes it was served in a tube shaped cup with too much ice too much boba and not enough of the tea 
4jngJxUATDHTIRaEUuNyHg Princeton Been coming here for almost 20 years Best Pizza hands down I have yet to find something on their menu that wasn t delicious Just wish they delivered Highly recommended 
4jw4CZ5loT5CA2YAS4BY5w Princeton Oh New Jersey America s armpit the butt of all state related jokes famous for nothing in particular and yet I am still amazed by some hidden gems that I find here Sakura s definitely makes the list But what makes it better is the fact that in order to get a full sakura s experience you need to be a regular here The sushi here is not only delicious but is also served with a healthy dose of dirty jokes and insults by the owners sushi chefs The scrolling text on the cash register food is good insults are free pretty much summarizes the atmosphere in this place and i absolutely love it 
4K2vLiGk_g__udFb42SDrg Princeton If you are looking for a high end steakhhouse do no come here if however you are looking for an upscale fridays this is your place I will preface this by saying I ve been to many top steakhouses in my time and was looking toward to checking this place out buy it failed on many levels 1 the place needed a real freshen up The carpets were dirty and the ceiling was covered in garbage bags apparently they were in the midst of a fix up which is no excuse overall the feel was not there and the seating was cramped and I go knocked about a dozen times by waiters that should know better Overall the feel was low level 2 service If I pay 500 dollars for a meal for my family of five two Young Kids I expect expert service drinks filled without asking etc it just was not there 3 food the food was very good bit not exceptional and my steak was not on the medium side of medium rare not happy and the app portions were weak i orderd 4 app and it was just not enough the calamari was not emough to share and was mailnly breading Overall I give it a 2 for trying to pass this off as real steakhouse 
4khDpWEuSIVBSi71tLTtEQ Princeton My friends and I were a longtime fan of this place as students to come here and hang out over a beer they have a great selection of interesting ones on tap but this last trip left us feeling a little disappointed The classic delicious triumph burger seemed to have shrunk in size and the prices seem to have gone up as well While the food was OK service was excellent and the chipotle mayo was delicious as usual it wasn t as good as we remembered it compared to a few years ago Unfortunately we may have to find a new regular go to place back in Princeton and just come back here for nostalgia s sake 
4KKN1dw9e644S98UKxwtEQ Princeton The hype is not hype Hoagie Haven is for real churning out simple sandwiches that focus on their core ingredients and do not try to be fancy At lunchtime on the Saturday of spring break the place was still full of students and other locals ordering and moving aside so as not to block the flow The place has a working man s feel to it but there is an order in motion here that might take a return visit or two to fully grasp I felt as if I was in the way more than once holding up the line and therefore coming between men and their hoagies A friend and I decided to pick two and split them for a little variety We were surprised by the sheer size of each beast almost two feet in length a tremendous value for the price The hot pastrami 6 90 large was stuffed full of delicious strips of meat I found it a little strange that he asked if I wanted mayonnaise but the sandwich was eventually delivered with a beautiful and biting mustard that complimented the pastrami perfectly The breads were fresh and delivered from nearby Italian Peoples Bakery thrown into their over for good measure to make sure everything was toasty More toppings confusion ensued with the chicken parmesan 7 90 large which somehow ended up with lettuce tomatoes and onions Those were easily removed though and the delicious crispy fried chicken and sharp cheese shined The sauce was used sparingly and I think anymore would have completed disentigrated the bread before we could eat it I would have loved to have asked for some more on the side though as it was one of the best parts 
4LFSJjNZ1U68r5ACcuKR9Q Princeton This is not where you wanna go I said that to myself when we were walking in the door In a very unlike me fashion I had no access to yelp reviews this day gasp horror and still I took a chance but man I could fell it just walking in that this wasn t the spot And I did it anyway It s just that I love good Thai food so much that sometimes the mere suggestion of the stuff must somehow amnesia out all the memories of past disappointing Thai impulse tries OOooh yeah The place didn t even smell like a Thai restaurant it struck me no fragrant wafts of steaming jasmine rice no sweet spiciness hung in the air Instead old fry oil fumes emanated The sinking feeling sunk even sinkier when looking over the menu Notable Thai favorites were missing and I begin to wonder why so many dishes on the menu seemed to be spelled way differently Clues I had already ordered a Thai iced tea when we were seated otherwise maybe I would have split Decided to share some appetizers and a pad Thai just to see keep it light baby We were hungry eh And you know that saying that goes a little something like The only thing you really need for a good meal is hunger Um untrue Untrue saying sayers Lackluster renditions these were from bland satays to noodles I can t imagine what Thai Village is the inspiration for this Thai Village s cooking but can we promise each other that we ll never travel there Sorry to report but this was a dismal village whose only saving grace was a good Thai iced tea but at least they have that at least there s that I guess stop by if a sudden Thai iced tea hankering hits but only then is the village slogan I learned 
4LVUGXth9DpRqKvdNVe4hA Princeton Excellent barbecue ribs and hoagies plus nothing beats the 5 lunch meal deal Prices are unbeatable and the food is flavorful Service is always expedient and friendly I just wish that they had one on campus It would certainly make lab more bearable Be sure to try the kong hoagie on weekdays and get the barbecue on Saturdays Oh and only open from Thurs to Sat 
4mcbjAuQ5sfIQfO_StO3SQ Princeton Never had a pizza here but LOVE the sandwiches The all natural healthy healthier ingredients make it a better lunch or light dinner choice The pizzas I must say look delicious and so do the enormous salads They try to do only locally grown produce as well as meats from Applegate farms are nitrate free They also feature healthier iced teas sodas and more 
4MD5zHLJbXT5dJ1UFKU7PA Princeton Very very charming I ve been coming here for as long as I ve been making my commute and the cafe is always bright and the staff is always very helping especially during the holidays with the prepared food what Sometimes a turkey is difficult for a novice cook The black forest brownie cookie is to die for the extreme richness with the crispy outside and moist inside with cherries is perfection Cappuccinos are very good as well with the perfect amount of foam and coffee 
4mgubCOQnO7Eup4ncdGGrg Princeton my office got a tray of sandwiches salads and cookies from here recently the sandwiches were great the corned beef was a little fatty moreso than normal but it was very flavorful and the sandwiches were all well constructed and stuffed with meats the macaroni salad left a little to be desired the cookies however were awesome they were big and half baked gooey deliciousness AND here s the best part the sandwich tray came with a giant pickle bowl i am a pickle fiend included were half sours kosher dills and my favorite pickled green tomatoes i m just excited to steal the pickle bowl to take home with me 
4mlJxLVk7er9D-2d0trEjA Princeton The upscale cool space very good service pricey tabs and creative presentation are all camouflage to hide mediocre cooking and flavors Food Creative Big deal The flavors and the actual cooking was nothing to write home about Price Extremely expensive considering the quality Service Very good detailed explanations of what we were eating Atmosphere Upscale cool Full Bar I would NEVER go back 
4MR3aaQdBEHxwe6Pm-GJCg Princeton I found Blue Point Grill when I was working in New Jersey in 2006 it was on my regular rotation back then but alas I was not yet a yelper I last went there in 2007 Flash forward to 2009 I find myself back in NJ for work and I convince my colleagues that we must go slightly out of the way for dinner Two plus years later BP doesn t disappoint We walk in and see that the restaurant is popular as ever After a 45 min wait right along what we were told we were seated A very friendly and knowledgeable waiter immediately greeted us We started with the buffalo shrimp 6 jumbo shrimp in savory buffalo sauce and the crab and guacamole martini Both disappeared in short order I went with the Wednesday lobster special and had a lobster roll as close to New England as one could get The lobster was prepared perfectly and had that great lobster top split bun My coworkers each picked a different fish and were pleased as well Blue Point Grill is every bit as good as I remember As a tip if you call ahead it will shorten your wait I hope I find myself nearby again soon 
4Mzu-7drc2l1fi9sRN7GNg Princeton This place is probably better for drinks and appetizers but I was in the area meeting up with an old friend so we chose Winberie s The salad was totally average The company was fantastic 
4M_U2tbIT6Ypz5zhSOcKIA Princeton I ve been here a few times with mixed results The food is unique and when fresh done very well I ve eaten more than my share of gristle here though and not for a small price The Roti Canai is a must have and most any curry here will be delicious but some of the meat dishes have left something to be desired like tenderizing All said I ll be going back again because the food when done well is phenomenal The service can be iffy too but don t go for the decor The corrugated zinc coated steel is longshoreman chic 
4nt0EWXwUjGw5JQJW-dNww Princeton So the rumors are true Just OK food Good ambiance VERY strange space Bad acoustics When the jazz band was playing on the other side of the restaurant it felt like the saxophone was being blown into my ear as I was eating my dinner Very very annoying I honestly can t remember what I ate here so that should tell you about the food The drinks were not so bad and I noticed they had some specials during the week and for happy hour The staff was helpful and attentive The entertainment was entertaining Even while I was screaming across the table so my guests could hear me over the music I suppose the music was still enjoyable It is a shame the acoustics are so terrible here as the restaurant is a beautiful place While we waited for our table we took our drinks from the bar to the outside lounge area where we relaxed with pillows next to the indoor outdoor fireplace Inside the decor was modern and upscale giving off a romantic feel I would say give this place a try since they are not consistent in customer reviews maybe your experience will be of the positive ones 
4oNUOStYZPLmoOm_m5OePA Princeton I m sad I didn t venture into this place sooner The guys here are so friendly and courteous and I love how they come out from behind the counter to greet their customers individually The way the guy says voila everytime he hands me my sandwich just puts a smile on my face I ve only ever had variations of their grilled veggie sandwich and it s always great Their bread is delicious soft and fluffy with a chewy hearty crust The roasted vegetables are seasoned perfectly and always very generously portioned Based on the other reviews I can t wait to go back and try their soups and other baked goods too 
4Ot9L69yZsSTwcqTMk_AHg Princeton I have stopped coming to Triumph on the weekends despite the fact that it has good specialty beer and a nice atmosphere The food is also decent especially the s mores I have almost no complaints about the actual food venue beer portion For this I would give 4 stars If you d like to check this place out I d recommend a weeknight The low rating is ONLY due to the terrible service and the pretentiousness of the staff The experience is for the most part unwelcoming and negative with some exceptions Let me share a few examples This is the ONLY place in town which charges a cover on the weekends supposedly for live music I would much rather pay twice that cover NOT to have to listen to the awful bands which sound like garage band mixed with karaoke In my opinion they ruin the atmosphere and make it hard to talk Staff is deliberately and frequently rude ignoring customers having an air of pretention being the only place in town to have ridiculous rules and to charge for things others do not charge for The impression I get is we are better than everyone because we are Triumph and we re going to treat our customers like cr ap because we can afford to I have been denied table service once when I assured them I was in fact having dinner but my friend was not and they didn t believe me I am the owner of a small non profit We have had events which regularly bring in 100 members to bars and restaurants around town which these businesses love to have 100 people paying for drinks but Triumph is the only place which has mandated a fee just for having a group of people come in not even to rent out the room for this reason we have refused to have an event there One time it was freezing cold in the winter I came to Triumph and was asked for a 5 cover but did not have any cash on me I asked if I could go inside in plain sight of the bouncers and get cash to give to the bouncer but was denied I was directed to an ATM inside their building which was broken When I alerted them of this they turned me away and told me to go 3 blocks down the street in the freezing cold to another ATM to get 5 so I could go into their restaurant I just went to Winberies and never came back Another time I told them I was going to see if my friends were inside and not staying and they confiscated my ID as collateral I think this is a bit unnecessary Thus it is pretty hit or miss It wouldn t be fair to say that none of my experineces have been positive and sometimes I still go to Triumph and enjoy myself if I m lucky and get a good waiter However they should really cut out the ridiculous rules pretention and train their staff better on customer service To sum I give it a 4 star rating for everything except service which gets a 1 
4qpO2ddet8FCQFAKTA4Ciw Princeton we have been to this location three times and the original in Princeton at least 5 the food is consistently good especially the scallion pancake as other reviews here mention the servers are pretty surly we figure they either don t speak much English or really don t care we have yet to have a bad experience despite 
4RBtYOId65O0rjPoNjkI3Q Princeton Obviously a favorite place of some of the many people who live nearby but this place is absolutely nothing to go out of your way for if you are looking for a sandwich If you re looking to experience what Princeton students experience then OK take your turn at Hoagie Haven Its really just your basic Jersey sandwich shop including the strong food odor that sticks to your clothes even after just a few minutes inside They make huge cheap subs just like lots of other similar places around here They use Italian Peoples bread just like lots of other similar places around here The fillings are pretty much like they are at lots of other similar places around here They offer a selection of small and medium sized bags of chips and bottled drinks just like lots of other similar places around here 
4Re2ppJMFVl1SAO037Mg_g Princeton After three trips to this restaurant it s really starting to grow on me The parking situation is catch as catch can as many have said but the valet can ease that problem The place is wildly popular so the noise level can be big but the upstairs seating helps there The food is four star level though which I think is high And the service while somewhat amateurish is attentive and pleasant No complaints there The menu like other Momo places is a bit of an adventure but I have to admit I like it All in I really am starting to like this place and would recommend it 
4rgNEhG_I_-V0v1b8t_d5w Princeton Got an email stating that on 3 23 12 the oysters would be 1 2 price at TrePiani When we asked about the 1 2 priced oysters the waitress said People keep asking about that but we know nothing about it We called the mgr over to show him the email on my Blackberry He reluctantly agreed to give us the 1 2 priced oysters but said that we could not have the Friday 1 2 priced wine by glass special Guess we were being punished Won t be back 
4rr3Dfhv3r2pryEZS6xKTw Princeton Not sure why this place has so many negative reviews but I ve been here twice and had a great experience Last time I went to the gym and came here afterwards for a small meal I ordered the honey mustard and bacon chicken sandwich which to my surprise was awesome Chicken was nice a juicy not dry unlike chicken I ve had at many of the so called nicer restaurants in the area and the ciabatta was super fresh Boyfie got the veggie burger which was actually incredibly tasty I didn t get any beer for the first time ever but they do have quite a nice selection of craft beers Sure it s not fast food prices at Winberie s but our server was awesome Our food came super fast And it was tasty Bottomline in my opinion one of the few establishments with food that is ACTUALLY good and doesnt tout itself as being sophisticated Come here if you re okay with a simpler looking place with solid food 
4S514q2lLnniivUUctQ9xQ Princeton It s a very nice independent coffee shop right off of Nassau Street It s pretty big with ample seating and live musicians on certain evenings nights The staff have more or less been friendly to me when I ve been there and seem pretty nice The coffee is good I thought it was cool that they have NOLA New Orleans styled iced coffee which sadly wasn t as cool or unique as it sounded 
4scpt13QeTPFi_zZgHUI7Q Princeton This is easily the best restaurant I ve been to in NJ I brought my girlfriend here for a significant birthday It wasn t cheap but well worth the price As other reviewers have said the food is delicious uniquely prepared and artfully presented and the wine list is very extensive 
4TWyyGxYnz3ib-4eR7D7KQ Princeton A Princeton mainstay Go to hoagie haven for great sandwiches at good prices And it s always a plus that the staff is friendly 
4u-PI0toq6OaYXIhTVcrRg Princeton Stopped by the other day as the ad intrigued me This place is confusing and I really think they need to be more focused and create an identity Is it Italian Greek or Middle Eastern The menu is way too long and confusing After pondering what to get for a long five minutes see last comment I ended up getting two slices of pizza I have yo say they were not bad I really wanted Middle Eastern food but I thought I would be disappointed Rating should be one star because of the confusing menu and identity but got s second star because the pizza was actually okay 
4UeySKweIb7MQD1OMLaiag Princeton Awesome chettinad food I wish I could add more stars 
4UWQyPX-HS0H4fXNq2JZRQ Princeton The margarita pizza here is very very good I don t know much about some of the other foods but it looks good and possibly worth trying in the future if the margarita wasnt so good 
4vbleUKHSKqkAI7dvt-Z_A Princeton Tom Yum Goong offers consistently solid Thai food in the Princeton area A couple caveats Vegetarian options are extremely limited Many of the vegetarian meals like tofu curries are cooked with pre made sauces that contain animal products Ask for clarification before assuming that an entree is vegetarian Takeout portions are usually smaller than seated portions Prices are high for Thai food in general at 10 20 for entrees although they are quite reasonable for restaurant food in the Princeton area BYOB if you want to drink I really like the panang and massaman curries and the pad thai is good too 
4VG5cXZR6FV818dBS2izOQ Princeton I was happy to see they had a pancake sampler choice on the menu I tried their pecan and peanut butter and chocolate pancakes each of which were very tasty I also had one corn pancake which I ve never seen before also very good The mashed hash side was creamy and delicious Coffee was sub par The line was out the door but not too long of a wait Our hostess began to walk us to our seat and then decided to just point it out which was weird but not a big deal The server was really nice and on top of things A little pricey for breakfast about 20 for 3 pancakes a side and coffee but the variety and uniqueness of their pancakes somewhat makes up for this Food 8 10 Staff 4 5 Price Value 2 5 Atmosphere 4 5 18 25 
4VOFACaFhqDF02kF5O3elQ Princeton We stopped here for dinner tonight Stepped in were warmly greeted and brought to a comfortable booth Tea and water were brought out immediately The crispy duck sounded good 13 95 half with boneless spare ribs 6 and shrimp toasts 5 as appetizers with a request for chile oil The spare ribs were too sweet Not as sweet as from some places but too sweet for me to continue eating particularly without any rice to soften the taste A generous portion We had to ask again for the chile oil The shrimp toasts were fluffy Not the usual shrimp paste on baguette slices fried and likely invented by Cuisinart in the 50 s but with more of a fried dumpling like texture Coated in sesame seeds Served with that orangy maraschino flavoured duck sauce Without the sauce the best item we had for dinner The duck was disappointing Not crispy Actually fatty soft and overly salty atop some gross looking cabbage No mild dipping sauce of any sort No soy Not even mustard But the fattiness and super saltiness turned me off The fortunes were lame but the orange slices were good 31 including tax and tip Ivy Garden is so much better 
4wappxd5bzG-KHIr_B5Aag Princeton their combination plates are alright there really isn t much japanese food in the area so if you have a craving this food court isn t a bad option their combo 1 includes scallops ehhh chicken teriyaki ehhh and a variety of tempura which isn t bad at all i think their sushi is overpriced esp for the quantity but when you re craving sushi you do what you gotta do 
4wBa_y4mLDkzdNxV_Oztjg Princeton We were in town from LA and looking for a good spot with good beers hooray We found Triumph Food Good Beer Great Get the sampler of 7 beers YUM 
4We_qlqCK9MBJD5nO5uxGg Princeton This is a fairly new restaurant in an area and good to have this variety I have eaten from here a couple of times one take out and one sit in The food was great service quite attentive yet unobtrusive The spice levels were somewhat on the muted side but the food had rich flavor I will happily come back 
---nya_pjxWmNFDFyAcfsA Urbana Another case of the Emperor s New Clothes Someone of the artsy set decided that this relatively good but overpriced fare was great pizza and all the lemmings followed suit Will anyone tell the Emperor he has no clothes The limited hours no delivery and lack of dining area add to the snob appeal Don t be taken in 
-0nacVFnlwcWSmRWP8kxHQ Urbana When I decided to order from Fat Sandwich Company at 1 am I expected an extremely unhealthy pile of fried foods stuffed into a roll That s exactly what I got I ordered the Fat MILF mostly because I m immature and anything with bacon on it is probably a winner I was not drunk or high just hungry Plus everything else I wanted was closed and FSC seemed like the best remaining choice As for the sandwich it was delicious It was a really big sandwich and took me quite a while to eat but I savored every bit of it Obviously there are many people who wouldn t enjoy eating a sandwich filled with mozzarella sticks chicken fingers cheesesteak bacon and fries I am not one of those people was amazing As I ate it I felt like I was on Epic Meal Time And that my friends is when I knew I found a winner The only downfall was that it was just warm by the time it got to me Still delicious but it would have been even better if I ate it hot 
-1-LqeEjMy5nKkfFklkvtA Urbana I used to work here and I liked it at the time Now I feel that since it s probably the biggest bar in the downtown area it s like the go to place for a lot of people and just gets way too busy Also I have friends that want to go there ALL THE TIME so I feel like I m kind of burnt out on it But then again if you want to go to a place that will almost always be busy it s right up your alley 
-3k_SrnUQrHDlbtrBv9wRA Urbana Really filling Got the burger and was super satisfied The beer battered burgers was overkill Super tasty super heavy Decent price for what I got Really filling Got the burger and was super satisfied The beer battered burgers was overkill Super tasty super heavy Decent price for what I got 
-4ZC1FnsewrAg3PLU6-YJA Urbana Of all restaurants in Chambana this is by far my favorite I used to go several times as week for either lunch or dinner when I was still in the area The food is homemade like which was always a big plus for me I prefer to be on the healthy side and Jerusalem offers that option with the bonus of being cheap And this fact makes it unique in a college town where most people are craving for cheap junk food I would go most frequently for the plate of the day 202 with chicken It is a big tray with an assortment of tasty items So big that sometimes you would end up saving half of it for dinner I can more simply define Jerusalem as tasty tasty tasty Totally love it Ah yes the owner Some people complain about him Well after going for so many times I found out he is a very warm person He might not give you a fake smile the first time you walk into his restaurant but he will give you a genuine smile the fifth time you go there 
-88k4WroAFypTeGFP9kJqA Urbana Having once been a U of I student I didn t understand why people liked Pokey sticks so much We had pizza and pokey sticks over the weekend after a football game and I still done understand the love for pokey sticks Crappy pizza and crappy pokey sticks I can t even say it s because it s cheap becuase it still cost me 25 for 16 pizza and 16 pokey sticks even though I had a buy one get one free coupon I would rather have Papa john s pizza any day of the week and twice on Sundays 
-9MB5ttu0zsyooJ1QDDQrQ Urbana I was blown away by this oasis of fantastic flavor The grilled stuffed pasta was so mind bendingly delicious that I tried to recreate this at home While the description and use of two sauces sounds like it would contradict itself each of the components blend marvelously in your mouth I sampled soups and small bites as well Over all I found the flavors in each dish are well balanced and don t compete for attention There is a certain finesse that s being used in the kitchen to render distinctly memorable flavor profiles The atmosphere was inviting modern and clean The service staff knowledgeable and attentive I wish I had one where I live and will absolutely be back when I find myself in Champaign again 
-A0bV3UsfVnOEmjuajpfBQ Urbana Amazing New Mexican Restaurant I hadn t heard about Maize just saw it pop up on First and Green where during my 4 years here on campus I ve seen many establishments come and simply disappear Me and my roommate all mexican went to try it highly suspicious that any place around here could actually offer authentic mexican cuisine Boy were we wrong This place is great It does everything right taco quesadillas huaraches and even tortas It s the level of authenticity you might expect from a place like Nuevo Leon I wish they just had more seating and were able to offer a dinner type atmosphere and menu Great lunch and cheap dinner food They are missing a lot of dinner items such as enchiladas mole or pozole However everything they do do they do it right Their salsas are great their tortillas delicious Everything has the perfect amount of grease Seasoning could be better but it s better that they under salt than over salt Definitely try this place out 
-a1s-Y6Y3nsosirGfGp1dw Urbana Pros Cheap huge portions friendly staff Cons This is not the best C U has to offer as far as Mexican food What I ordered First visit enchiladas verdes chicken with a side of beans The salsa verde was bland notably lacking in onion garlic cilantro and salt The chicken was seasoned with a sweet and smoky tomato sauce the smoke flavor overpowered the salsa verde tortillas cheese and cream They use sour cream not Mexican crema which was disappointing The beans were lacking in flavor I don t know if they were canned or if they were boiled in water without onion garlic etc Second visit steak tacos and rice The tacos were so greasy it was as if the meat was deep fried and then they poured two tablespoons of oil in the taco I asked for a flour tortilla expecting hoping for a good flour tortilla unfortunately it wasn t any better than the store bought flour tortillas in the refrigerator section having that unmistakable preservative taste Bottom line Probably fine if you just want nachos and margaritas and don t know good Mexican food but head elsewhere for non Americanized fare 
-b3LdDyO8278QuYEk43KpA Urbana This hidden away small eatery has the best Thai food in town The prices are reasonable and there must be some addictive enzyme they add to the food because I can t seem to get enough of it My favorite dish is the turkey shrimp pad Thai Unfortunately it has ruined my eating pad Thai anywhere else since this is the best 
-bj1macVgiwK0ZWlY0OJZA Urbana Papa Del s is my favorite stuff crust pizza ever Oh man back when I was in school it used to be a real treat to go here Usually if someone was visiting and had a car this was one of the destinations The pizza takes a LONG time to make which is expected But it s SO delicious I live up in Chicago now but I haven t forgotten you Papa Del s 
-bLRTk1jPOsA7BRkIpAV7g Urbana After being a loyal patron for seven years I am done with this place While they still have some great drink selections the service has gotten so bad On a Friday afternoon I was one of six sitting at the bar Two bartenders and 1 2 servers were working and it still took them 20 minutes to take my order With the downtown Champaign scene evolving this kind of situation is unacceptable 
-BYbZ2tMgvJxd_fGKzWMgQ Urbana Amazing food for the price I love the cucumber salad they start you off with The bento box is also awesome It s great if you want just a little bit of everything and at around 8 it was well worth every penny Their sushi alone is also amazing It feels more like a traditional Japanese restaurant compared to other restaurants in Champaign I ll definitely be back 
-cQn_d14-CJxbrKRpoE_Pw Urbana We usually sit at the bar and order up tapas and drinks The bartender never missed a chance to mix us up a mean cocktail of his own creation The food is good and priced right The atmosphere is also wonderful and very unique They also serve brunch which is great 
-d3Hvz2SgQb335VQhINVTA Urbana Excellent Chinese food in the Champaign Urbana area Of course the standard American Chinese food is offered but one should try the authentic Sichuan cuisine or even hot pot Fair prices excellent balance of flavor consistently high standards It worth the trip to Lincoln Square mall to eat at this hidden gem 
-EL79mGaEy4iTs7rM1CdYA Urbana Mock duck yummy vegan dishes Yummy Get them now Eat them now mmmmmmmmm 
-fVKoB8mRKoLJvTsAE71cw Urbana Mas Amigos is consistently the best place to get Mexican food in C U Their staff are incredibly friendly and the place always feels warm and welcoming whenever I enter I invariably get something with chorizo because 1 They do it well here and 2 I EFFING LOVE CHORIZO AND YOU CANNOT TELL ME ANY DIFFERENT SO THERE When life is hard or you want a moment to celebrate an accomplishment in grad school end of a conference successful presentation glad you survived another week then it is time to pitch in for a pitcher or three of margaritas They are decently sized about the right strength and although a little too sweet still manage to make a fun evening even more fun And if this hasn t convinced you of the joys of Mas Amigos know that it also boasts a view of the wonderfully dubious C U landmark Illini Arcade Yes that s right you can see the wooden fence that obscures the parking lot of the sex emporium known as Illini Arcade whilst you enjoy delicious Mexican food and or watch awesome Spanish language TV I m just saying it makes for a wonderful night Also CHORIZO 
-g5blxbKP5SPFLfrkIuv5A Urbana Fantastic bbq seitan sandwich Even better than the one offered clover in cambridge ma 
-Ge_Vaz-bObDKDlTNBajMA Urbana If you want good pizza in Champaign Papa Del s is the place to go Their Sicilian Pan pizza is some of the best I have ever had They also have half price slices everyday from 3 4 p m Can t beat a deal like that 
-hepP8WoOSRAXMRnzaSppQ Urbana Cheap Asian food though on the oily side Cravings definitely gets busy during the lunch hours though The owner is a cool guy he knows a ton of Asian languages and dialects Oh yeah don t eat in the restaurant unless you want to go back to class lab smelling like Chinese food 
-hkyRxSAQmxTvqKEPPxLVw Urbana Best BBQ in town Unfortunately everyone knows it so the wait can be pretty long 30 40 min at peak hours But you can get a drink to pass the time My favorite is rib tips with Carolina Red sauce but everything is great here The beer selection is not huge but it is always terrific and they switch it up a lot Service is friendly and the food is usually ready quickly since it s all smoked I eat here at least once a week and am not tired of it yet Good thing since I always take home leftovers 
-iMbiA6M-Ar0PlupTc2YWQ Urbana I love this bar If you ve been here before and had a bad experience I encourage you to try it again The bar has undergone a change in ownership and management a remodel and the hookah and alcohol are now separate The drinks are inexpensive and very strong They aren t joking when they call them Stron Islands They have 2 dart boards and 2 pool tables for the game oriented and new booths for those who aren t My favorite night to go to Green Street is Tuesday They have Outlaw Karaoke the same awesome karaoke DJ who does White Horse Wednesday nights but without the flooded bathrooms Bud and Miller family bottles are only 2 and Mikey and Dan have a whole list of signature drinks if you re not into beer Overall Green Street is a great place to grab a drink any night of the week 
-JSFirBfNXoDTBsB8RAc3w Urbana Siam Terrace is probably second for Thai food in CU And even then it s pretty close Both restaurants have their particular strengths so part of it depends on what you re in the mood for The staff is very friendly although sometimes a little slow if it gets busy I think they have the best pad thai in town To me it has the perfect blend of sweetness nutiness and spice complimented by the fresh bite of the cilantro and crunch of sprouts and shredded carrot It s sweeter than your typical pad thai but it s very well balanced overall Their appetizers are nicely priced and I have enjoyed all of them that I tried I would not recommend the Thom Kha soup here It s a bit too sweet and lacks some of the depth of other versions of this soup I ve had It s not bad by any means but it wasn t what I was looking for in that soup Be bold with spice here It can vary but I find that they tend to be a bit more gentle with the spice overall A big plus for Siam Terrace is its selection of sushi It s decently priced for the most part and everything I ve had is tasty I d definitely recommend their Bakery sushi It s moderately priced and is battered and served with some excellent eel sauce Be careful when you first get it though as it s VERY hot For a drink I recommend trying the coconut juice or Thai Iced Tea Both are refreshing and a great sweet compliment to the spicier dishes 
-KClFfe3QFxQW1WGhPsbeA Urbana It s Pops for Pizza or No Place at All Seriously this is the best pizza you will ever have deep dish that is And yes I ve had Chicago pizza at the institutions and this is still way better Beware though the place is insane on weekends and it takes 45 minutes to bake a pie so call ahead if you think you re going to be bored talking to your table mates for that long I would give Papa Dels 5 stars but the last 3 times I ve been there the service has sucked not the rude sucky but they have jacked up our order every time We want thick they give us thin We wanted pepperoni they give us sausage This last time we asked to see the manager and tried to at least get a free za out of it no free food here owner s policy he says Normally this would piss me off so much I would never go back but the pizza is just so damn good I do anyway Sigh 
-kfzjU_hKjLQxBMVsEyDRQ Urbana Waiter There are pubes in my fruit cup Thought the pineapple tasted fishy No like actual fucking fish It tasted like a fish in my mouth Then I found a pube on my cantaloupe It s been a rough morning Needless to say my therapist is not going to be happy about this See photos 
-KM4MlhbjHLM_pm4FdMhbw Urbana Update Ok I had dinner at the Black Dog The ribs were to die for the beer selection makes me feel like I ve gone to brew heaven and the service was good Now only if they were open on Sundays This place pretty much does what it needs to Great beer selection real lemonaide awesome meat ok service I didn t have a single complaint It beats the pants off of the other bbq places in town for taste and offerings Yum

-LDcT5V5AdQPSImEReJP9g Urbana Came here for my birthday Was greeted at the door by the host and led into the dining room that was dimly lit by candlelight We ordered a couple glasses of pinot noir and were happy with their selection Our appetizer the broiled goat cheese was amazing The grilled bread provided great texture to the meaty pumpkin seed and spice spread and the divine creaminess of the goat cheese Our entrees were the two dinner specials for the evening seared diver scallops and a filet Our scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned The accompanying puree had pieces of bacon which perfectly complemented the entire dish Our filet was a beautiful medium rare piece of meat that just melted in my mouth The bourbon demi glace and gratin brought the dish together into a very enjoyable experience We tried two desserts the molten chocolate cake and the green tea white chocolate mousse I absolutely loved the mousse while my partner preferred the chocolate cake The best part of the rich chocolate cake was the fresh mint ice cream that came with it Overall it was an amazing dinner Go to Radio Maria and order their dinner specials You will not be disappointed 
-lHYAiXWm-LIItx58GCv2A Urbana Best bulgogi around this area 
-lmJOvp1nysp2j0fRSPXOg Urbana Positively horrendous The food is sickening greasy stale and in horrid combinations mozzarella sticks and chicken nuggets and mayonnaise and fries on a donut bun really The tables are never wiped off or cleaned and we had to sit in these gross chairs with used kleenexes tossed everywhere which we grudgingly had to pick up and throw out ourselves My friend used the restroom and reported that her shoes stuck to the floor with every step The entire place was swarming with flies It Was Very Bad 
-MmtcAnCv3zpWrImWHZ4qA Urbana I have a few qualms with Luna I want to love it I really do but I just can t The first time I went there was with a large party for Mom s weekend and we had a reservation We ended up waiting an hour to be seated There was no sitting area just a hallway so it was rather uncomfortable When we were finally seated we had a delicious meal Second time I went there was for a date with my boyfriend We are both vegetarians and we had no problems finding enough food to eat We left full and a little tipsy good wine I went for a third time recently with my two roommates and it was a disaster There was hardly anyone at the restaurant but we still had terrible service They seemed understaffed apparently due to rehearsal dinner going on simultaneously I can give some leeway on that but there was no excuse for the kind of neglect we received My friend had a very rare steak that took forever to be sent back We were out of drinks for a very long time and we needed other things that a more attentive waitress would have easily noticed I want to love this place but service is a huge deal for me It s disappointing that Luna can t excel in this because I do think they have some good food 
-myEZHy7h4VBB8LvAnUegg Urbana I went again and my experience was much better the second time around This time I decided to try one of the recommended burgers I think they were called Chef Inspired instead of building my own I had the Hawaiian Pineapple Jalapenos cheese and bbq sauce I think It was much better my burger was a lot less greasy and it stayed together quite well I got the Cajun fries again those were pretty good as well I went again with a large group 7 people and the staff saved a table for us while we were in line That was awesome since it was pretty crowded on a Saturday night Pros Tasty burger A large fry is plenty for 2 people to split Not overloaded on cajun flavor Staff was excellent again I didn t get a milkshake but they looked kinda expensive for the size but supposedly they taste pretty good Cons Fries were alright I had a lot of little pieces in the order I split with a friend Overall I had a much better second experience at Meatheads I would recommend that you try one of the chef inspired burgers I can say that I will come back here again

-p7xO7nbPYggBv8y3b3OPQ Urbana I like the beer selection but we went there for a birthday party where I brought a cake and they wanted to charge me a 5 plate fee It was so absurd we had all bought dinner a bottle of wine etc It seems like they don t want groups to converge there I ll go somewhere else next time 
-pHeT5N4-qCw1IFJC7drgg Urbana Ok I have to admit I really wanted to like this place This whole upscale burger joint concept is really growing right now and I kinda dig the idea I ve been here on three occasions hoping that I was just missing something Unfortunately It s just not that good As others have mentioned the staff really seems to try and are friendly The atmosphere is as expected Sort of an industrial modern atmosphere with lots of wood It s a new facility so it s clean and tidy in upkeep Can t fault any of these items But then there s the food Burgers fries drinks and shakes Pretty much that s it There is a selection of theme burgers and a build your own option First time I went I had the basic Cheeseburger It came promptly in a basket with a pile of fries The burger was covered in so many toppings that it was really just a topping sandwich flavored with meat Everything was so greasy and sloppy that you really had to eat it with a knife and fork Meh not my thing But I figured I d give it one more chance and try a build your own next time This wasn t much better There s just no flavor to the burger and it s a sloppy mess to eat I decided to splurge on a shake this time to take with me By the time all was said and done I was out darn near 15 00 Way too expensive for a burger and fries Then about two weeks ago I was late to an appointment and needed a quick lunch As I mentioned I really wanted to like this place so I decided to swing in and give it one more try Ordered a bacon cheeseburger this time Even worse than the first two Size and quality had dropped from the first two times always a bad sign Seems like they are starting to cut corners Again dropping 10 for lunch really isn t going to work Culver s on a good day make a way better burger for quite a bit less There are a couple new places with this theme opening in the next few months around town Let s hope they are an improvement 
-q_jLt9Gmtekefr_UCJaWA Urbana Like all the reviews say this is a popular place Plan to wait on the curb literally for your table with the rest of the hungry patrons Ordered the platters 3 meat choices and we mixed up the sides Meat was excellent and the highlight was the burnt ends Wow Don t miss them Sweet potato fries were good but I ve had better probably because these ones had cooled down This is a don t miss food destination that should satisfy your BBQ craving 
-r-EuQOcq0FKF8aJuURShw Urbana The Hubster and I decided to do a date night try out Destihl and then go see The Exorcist at the Virginia our date night may not be your definition of romantic but that s neither here nor there I d heard about how crowded Destihl gets around dinnertime and never having been there before I went the AARP route and reserved a table for us at 5 15 to give ample time for slow service this was unnecessary I was surprised to learn that Destihl is cavernous There was absolutely no shortage of tables How does it ever get crowded Who knows In any case we were irritatingly seated near the only large loud party in the entire restaurant Nothing like listening to a bunch of screechy teenagers dressed up for Homecoming say semi racist things and then shush each other on date night We got appetizers and small plate y things to constitute our meal All were finger food all were messy and delicious We tried the cheese curds lightly breaded crunchy thoroughly melty thai chicken wings a nicely spicy slow burn flavorful thick sauced with fabulous peanuts sprinkled over the top and beer boiled shrimp a tad too much seasoning that clung to our fingers and overwhelmed most other flavors not much beer taste but otherwise you know cold shrimp are tasty on their own I tried a pint of their black IPA which I thoroughly enjoyed We also shared their chocolate trio or M nage Trois or whatever they call it which consisted of mexican hot chocolate thick hot nom a chocolate tart delicious filling but with a crust that was absolutely impossible to cut into making it awkward to eat much less share and zanzibar chocolate ice cream heaven I need to try more things to be sure that this is actually a problem but I feel like everything on their menu is too complicated There are SO MANY INGREDIENTS listed on every single menu item Too many seasonings too many flavor combinations Every time I read something I was like Mmm yes yes yes oh no you went too far Our waiter was extremely enthusiastically friendly to the point of making us feel a bit awkward I mean he hung out and chatted I don t harbor ill will against the guy or anything he was really nice but you know I m on a date with my main squeeze please leave Considering all the stuff we got our tab was surprisingly cheap I think we were out for under 30 I waffled between 3 5 and 4 stars but I m feeling generous today 
-R50dceov_qN1YWd32QTDQ Urbana We eat here on a monthly basis and we have had positive experiences every time we eat here The service can be a little bit slow at times but overall they do well The owners also work in the establishment so they always do everything to make sure you are happy The food is good and moderately priced it is worth a trip to check it out 
-RaYs0lOfALHTsLnWd3jcw Urbana Sadly I discovered Kofusion only a couple months before I graduated but once I discovered the place I quickly became a regular Firstly people should recognize the restaurant for what it is Korean fushion food Thus there s a wide variety of sushi my personal favorite hwe dup bap like sashimi salad and a smaller selection of hot but still great scallops anyone entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much If you need a quick sushi fix dollar sushi Sundays 1 roll 1 will definitely satisfy your cravings There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll read little to no raw fish At first I was really disappointed by this but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough Big Roll Coconut Roll that I didn t mind at all and eat about 15 20 worth of sushi anyway Yes I am a sushi whore If you really want good sushi with more raw fish or more interesting combinations Kofusion is still the place to go Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow type rolls and more It s about 1 2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I ve never felt like my rolls weren t worth the cost Finally Kristina is my favorite waitress Maybe she remembered me for my order hwe dup bap seriously try it if you love raw fish it is divine or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well but after just a few weeks of going weekly a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly As a sushi lover it doesn t really get any better than this I m not going to lie Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi I don t find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll i e Big Roll that s the one I had wrapped in soy rice paper For those that don t like sushi because of the seaweed this is a great alternative For those that still love sushi try it anyway it s a great substitution that s worth it to get on its own once in awhile I will forever miss Kofusion now that I m not in the area so please go get the hwe dup bap Big Roll Coconut Roll or even the thai curry for me please 
-rKylh2Qay8w-hXwqhu3UQ Urbana Food is always fast and fresh here And I ve noticed the naan has gotten considerably larger since I last set foot in here in early 2007 But I m not complaining 
-srxCNfukfK-bUWY4yr6yA Urbana This is my favorite place to eat Chinese food on campus Golden Harbor might have a little bit better tasting food but this is about half the price You can t go wrong with any schezuan beef or brocoli and beef Also I would highly recommend the Dry Chili Chicken off the Chinse menu That dish is amazing 
-SWI5A1QRQnpvOz-L5Aipg Urbana Five Star Bubble Tea Ok everyone is right about the food However that is not the prize at Cafe Evo Now listen I recently moved here from Oakland CA The Bay Area knows alot about killer bubble tea with tapioca pearls No one can challenge this But let me tell you something Cafe Evo is the only bubble tea within a two hour drive to Chicago that is worth finding I recommend Banana Taro or Coconut and you have to order it as banana snow with pearls Shake it up before you plunge the straw in and try not to suck it all down in the car before you get back to work I for one have always devoured the whole thing before I can get five minutes back across town Pitiful but incredible Oh and don t expect them to be nice 
-UEpk7rjYp1cNQfAvQUFkg Urbana It is similar to Flat Top Grill which has been a campus favorite for a few years However the atmosphere is better the ingrediants a bit fresher and it is NOT on campus which is huge for us townies It has a more up scale vibe as opposed to Flat Top s college student vibe I do wish they had some sample dishes good sauce mix ideas like Flat Top The lunch is 9 95 Sounds like a lot but the portion was large and if you do smaller portions you can make multiple trips for that price The drink menu looked intriging I think it d be a fun date place Some mentioned not seeing a vegetarian protien I believe I saw Tofu but it was in with the veggies not the meat section We tried the chocolate wantons and I thought they were perfect light and flavorful The waiter also recommended the cheesecake Speaking of the waiter he was incredibly attentive My drink was refilled before I even realized I was low 
-UMCCvkh5-uhMdcSp7CrLg Urbana Came here for my friend s birthday I heard great things about this place so I had high expectations Needless to say I was a bit disappointed The pros the hibachi chef was very entertaining and friendly the food was delicious especially the scallops perfectly seared with a golden brown exterior and tender interior The cons small portions for what you pay for the server didn t seem to know the menu at all seemed really frazzled asked him several questions that he didn t know the answer to had to ask for refills on my drink countless times overcharged my friend s credit card by like 40 wtf Overall the food was decent service was not great not impressed 
-uvgDqykZ0stUWp4uX_r8g Urbana I came here for lunch on Friday It was pretty quiet only a couple other people eating I had the chicken quesadilla and what was supposed to be a carne asada taco with no onions Prices were fairly low and the food came rather quickly First off they messed up my order as the taco wasn t carne asada Then when I sent it back and it returned the meat was carne asada but was covered in onions By this point I was over it so I didn t bother to send it back a third time just didn t eat it I was expecting more from this place because of all of the rave reviews To be honest my quesadilla was really oily on the outside and extremely bland It was missing heat spice anything to liven up the taste Overall I wasn t too impressed and doubt I ll be back It just wasn t all that 
-uYNW9LneTUr61Jnj6Lplw Urbana I m not a BBQ fan but this was amazing I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was fantastic Definitely recommend this place 
-VEwlYs3f_2Ui8yyvVMzmA Urbana First class breakfast served in an interesting and inviting atmosphere Ensconsed in an old building in downtown Urbana Courrier Cafe is definitely a cut above the typical restaurants in U of I s hometown We were pleasantly surprised My wife had the Ham and Scram and a side of pumpkin pancakes that were on special The eggs were well cooked and the ham was really tasty It had the right hint of smokines which I thought was particularly pleasant I had the Spanish omlette which as usually happens in gringo joints was billed as hot by our waitress It was merely low medium Generous shots of hot sauce kicked my dish up to the real heat level for me Delicious coffee and really nice bread that made excellent toast was also provided Attentive service but the restaurant only had ten patrons when we were there right at opening so it may not be representative Not worth a special trip to Champaign Urbana but if you are in town or even passing by a slight detour to patronize it is worth it 
-vgrhW_V4BXbmCN2DTEJpA Urbana Most of the reviews here aren t very fair to this establishment It is what it is and if you don t want a sandwich stuffed with different fried foods then you re in the wrong place I ve been here after drinking and it was great Otherwise I only come here when I am experiencing a particular brand of self loathing in which case it is still pretty good The Fat Sorostitute has been my go to for the past several visits If you come during the day while sober the people that work here will be pretty nice and courteous to you If you come at night while drunk they ll be less so I know I couldn t serve drunk people all night without getting a bit mad so I don t blame them Also I suspect the counter is relatively high to keep drunk people from doing something stupid I think this is funny 
-wc4lMVEukP2OvGCW5HXGg Urbana A great alternative to Cravings It isn t as busy and you will get your food in under 5 minutes The Chicken Chow Fun is some of the best I ve had 
-X_T47pqhuc3eaoCkXm-Jw Urbana Burnt ends fresh lemonade and a pulled pork sandwich I m in heaven 
-Y9fm-dV95qoZ_a0oVW7SA Urbana NOM This place has great food hands down I have been here on two occasions now and both times it has made my heart sing The flavors are exquisite You get to pick your own sauce which is great and they ll bring you a sample if you re not sure you re going to enjoy one but you think well maybe Get the burnt ends While everything I ve tried has been good the burnt ends are the best thing on the menu What they did to that meat is beautiful artistic completely wonderful simultaneously sinful and heavenly Go here For sure 
-YhnjaKlYvUkht9X3EbMkA Urbana Peking Garden is a wonderful place excellent for its variety of interesting dishes and pleasant atmosphere I throughly enjoyed my chile chicken fried chicken with chile peppers and a fiery hot sauce which was the spiciest dish I have ever had in a Chinese restaurant The meal ended with fortune cookies and a plate of succulent oranges The service was great and the prices weren t bad either I definitely recommend this restaurant 
-yjsQpus-dhrLGmMHk93_w Urbana For its size El Charro packs a punch I ve formerly only eaten in the restaurant here which was always tasty I was a quesadilla fiend for a while and they always delivered figuratively not literally Lately I ve been trying to cook my own Mexican food and the grocery section though small had everything I needed the other day corn husks Valentina chiles de rbol and El Milagro tortillas And walking up to the counter with two huge bags of husks the guy behind the counter started a friendly conversation about different kinds of tamales Awesome 
-YNi9f3PmIHIJzZhNb3PbA Urbana I m always a fan of some good barbeque and since moving to Champaign I ve been hearing tons of good things about this place Fairly certain I also saw it had won some Best Barbeque awards for the area My hopes were high but after trying it I was terribly let down The barbeque this place serves reminds me of very average cafeteria style food I ll say I definitely thought the meat was very good I have tried the chicken pork and beef and it has a nice smoked taste to it Unfortunately everything else that makes the sandwich fails The barbeque sauce perhaps ultimately the most important ingredient pretty much is what ruins the sandwich in my opinion Like a lot of other reviews have said the sauce is unduly sweet and extremely watery It almost tastes like drinking liquid sugar in some regards The bread is not much better Sandwiches are literally served on tiny hoagie rolls like the generic ones you buy at the grocery store for 1 Probably the most generic cheap type of bread anyone can afford Sides were also generally unimpressive Baked beans were nothing special and I also had a potato salad side that seriously had almost NO taste to it It tasted like eating raw potatoes All and all definitely a huge let down for me and very sub par barbeque and sides Really a surprise they keep winning the best Barbeque award for the CU area but I guess there s no other competition Sad to say but this was probably one of the worst barbeques I ve ever had 
-ZG3e6NZxZSd7UYlCE6yPg Urbana Went with a large group for a birthday celebration ended up ordering family style Everything was fantastic especially the stick fried tofu and the pork buns Fantastic place to go with a large group but just make sure to bring cash to split the bill Overall the best Chinese food I ve had bar none A bit on the expensive side but well worth the cost 
-ZQZI9fjg8OSQ3puBdPw0Q Urbana Great indian food spiced well and not Americanized The naan is fresh and amazing 
-_GryYqhVWFZkaZuW_ugwg Urbana Food and bubble tea aren t consistent Sometimes it s good and sometimes it s bad 
0-f7i185-WXP71E-r49VHw Urbana Quick Good Cheap Pretty large menu They used to have a location on Green street but it wasn t as popular 
00greMBGiIJ7mQF5rSxSIw Urbana I am really torn apart by the Courier Cafe I will go there and it will be amazing all around then the next time I go I will get awful service For example last night I went there with a group of four for dinner and waited 10 minutes to even get our drinks ordered Once the waiter even comes by he doesn t even say hi and is very unfriendly Throughout the meal we do not get refills and barely see the waiter Then once we get our dinner plates he hands us the checks Talk about being rushed out of a place I guess they don t want to sell desert or after dinner drinks This is unfortunate because the food is great The burger are good value and the friend chicken dinner is one of the best around town The milkshakes are the best I have ever had I will refuse to be a regular customer though after my last experience It is now just a place to go once in a great while or for a shake The only reason they got three stars is because of the food otherwise it would be a one 
01owT4bgiF4kZQjV-h6c7g Urbana We dined alfresco on a Sunday evening in June We were the only people outside It was our own private place Our server was on the ball and attentive but not annoying The manicotti in meat sauce was awesome I will seriously get that every time I go Salad was typical as was the g b Wine was decent and reasonably priced I grew up in a very Italian area and I honestly found this food to be up to par 
02ffV9hsAI7tIemC4EW86Q Urbana Four stars for the win El Toro At last a place where I can watch the Pumas eat some decent food joke in Spanish and even have fried ice cream if I m playing gringo tourist I like it And I don t mind taking midwestern friends here It makes me look edgy cuando yo hablo en espanol con la gente Also the alambres were fantastic 
03f8obd2q8EKZQAGFQONLA Urbana It s a cheap meal but it s still overpriced You re literally getting a dried chunk a ramen just like the ones you see at the supermarket Instead of paying 1 for it you ll pay about 5 It comes with ingredients like bok choy and fish balls but not enough to make up for the inflated price I don t know why the rest of the reviewers are excited I could make this stuff in a second Just go to Am Ko and toss everything into some hot water and start charging people 5 What a business model 
03npOrUQKj4AIvhwl6K2xQ Urbana I am writing strictly about a lunch experience The service was a bit mediocre but the place has a bright and interesting atmosphere The honey turkey wrap was delicious and the portions were quite filling 
04lK95psN_P9gA3ViEOibQ Urbana Hands down the most underrated place on campus Everything they offer is at least good while their gyros are nothing short of amazing for Chambana at least The jazz shows are a nice touch the prices are very reasonable and the staff is always friendly One of my favorite places to spend a break whether it s between classes or during work It doesn t offer enough food on the level of their gyros to warrant a five star rating but it deserves a strong four 
05593cfGxhCmRms5Umag4A Urbana To be fair I do know the folks that run this place BUT I would love Manolo s anyway I think they have a creative menu not standard ingredients in their empanadas and pizza Very large pizza slices and they always make it fresh You can buy their stuff when you are in the Canopy Club too I ve turned several people on to this place and I truly miss it now that I m gone I think it is really affordable and a nice change to the usual pizza and campus food scene 
06rMYMIKxRf8h4Olgog8rA Urbana I ve only eaten at a Taco Bell once since 2005 and it was at this one last year I got food poisoning Awesome 
073eSi-Epn3bY1yJk5U53w Urbana Courier Cafe milkshakes are the BEST IN THE WORLD Seriously their milkshakes are to die for It s awesome because they ll give you one glass plus a metal cup of the stuff that didn t fit in the glass Perfect for sharing or for splurging Every single milkshake I ve had here has been thick creamy and full of hand dipped goodness One of my favorites peanut butter and fudge In terms of food their salad bar is always a good choice fresh and lots of variety and I really like their chicken pesto pita Whatever you order though make sure you get a milkshake 
08KhUEGfGna4QQBuha85Aw Urbana I have had far better Greek food at other places and there are better diners but nothing matches the combination of good food and absolutely top notch service that you find at Papa George s Of course This is Papa George s We ain t no chain the owner said when I asked for a small menu substitution I feel if your e going for teh Greek Diner combo you can t go wrong with the American Gyros French fries and if you have room later baklava sundaes ice cream sundaes with baklava crumbs atop them Reflect on how unhealthily delicious that is Sunday brunch is also tasty although perhaps not exceptional Again the service tips it from a 4 star to a 5 star review Additionally they have a happy hour on Thursdays with 2 martinis unfortunately they re about as good as you can expect for 2 Don t fail to check out their weekly 5 lunch specials though THOSE are fantastic Can you tell I have a soft spot for Papa George cuz I do 
09UJun3cZzpB-hoiW_3U5w Urbana I spent 2 50 on lunch yesterday and was almost too full to eat dinner that night Got the Thai Mei Doodle only 1 for the grand opening with chicken pickled carrots sprouts and mushrooms At 75 for the chicken topping I wasn t expecting all that much meat but there was tons And super delicious Veggies were super fresh and plentiful as well It was a perfect lunch for a cold day It s tucked away behind Insomnia Cookies so don t miss it 
0A1Rdj2GnkDTFc7DI97PQA Urbana Every time I go they do not disappoint 
0aHksTbYtrvGwkASmb0Wbg Urbana Mia Za s The hell I m pretty sure that when I was in college 03 07 this place was just plain old Za s But that was back in the DAY back when shit was REAL It s true this place has no personality but the food is serviceable and I like building my own pizza salad sandwich pasta dish The pizza crust is super thin and crispy and I like that the salads are ENORMOUS The pasta I could live without I don t know why but it kind of reminded me of pasta they might serve in the dorms GOOD dorm pasta yes but still dorm pasta Maybe that makes sense only in my head 
0bSeJdmPxCLgHO9fP0wu5w Urbana Escobar s is easily one of my favorite date spots I have been here three times spring fall and winter The ambiance is romantic and cozy although it does get crowded due to the restaurant s popularity and for other good reasons too The servers are really nice and the food is delicious My only qualm is the hostess she has always seemed to be disorganized or overwhelmed every time that we have visited and does not handle it very well Other than that Escobar s is great 
0BvQDUTI74VzwzPJmff4Jw Urbana Second visit Is enjoyable I think due to the unique menu and the ambiance of the old newspaper office Rueben and onion rings are good Wife had the turkey club and both shared the potato skins appetizer All good and will go back as there appears many more items to try 
0bxjHj_Rl3c3z-AvC43Dzg Urbana Been here once for lunch once for dinner and once late night Honestly the crowds were biggest during lunch definitely unusual for a campus bar The food was okay typical bar food but Legend s is better 2 stars for the food drink and party atmosphere 4 stars for the fact that it is CLEAN pretty and well decorated so a 3 over all 
0C9nRqOj0ZGeLxLEzkwtZg Urbana Not bad Got the 1 3 Texas something or another burger with bacon lettuce tomato and grilled onions Portions were huge swimming in grease The fries were alright but not the best crispy but not too much potato The white bread buns were cold with all the other toppings the texture clashed with the grilled burger and crispy toppings I wished they would toast the bun slightly to make it fit It s basically an okay Five Guys says my friend It isn t the best burger around I was hoping for better meat and a big honking patty over two stacked slim slices of meat I gave it three since 11 dollars for the full meal is a lot for just an alright burger I will try it again and recommend it to anyone who wants to try that upscale burger joint 
0Cdn61Ws4QnbEuiJMj_D2Q Urbana My favorite pizza place in the whole wide world I wish they would ship via FedEx I live in California but every time I am in C U I make a bee line for Papa Dels 
0Dcs_JH7He66Gs3tktyL6A Urbana Poorest customer service I ve ever seen in not just the restaurant industry but in any service Manager was unbelievably rude Will never go back next time I m in Champaign and hope nobody else makes the mistake of going here 
0Dl9sLqP3CwKbUgX_WVVTQ Urbana Good atmosphere but the food is overpriced and midiocre I had a collection of appetizers at the bar that were not large enough portions We were ignored by the bartender for quite a long time as well and the place was almost empty 
0DLsB3av7W93u4O9FR_4sw Urbana I am rating the food Not the bar Let s say I take a thin ground beef patty and take a mallet and pound the crap out of it so that it s shape isn t even round any more That is their Backdraft Burger Don t even try to order a medium rare one They are all cooked the same like a fast food joint Was disappointed with their burger As far as the bar environment I would give that three stars 
0DVz4PBO4TCtD2_Tl8jcZw Urbana I wasn t expecting to taste great barbecue in Illinois but Black Dog surprised me I enjoyed the smoked chicken made with local free range chicken I love that Black Dog uses local ingredients The food is delicious the service was great too 
0eIGvk870P2IEKXG3n3iew Urbana It s a chain But I like it Their chicken caesar wrap is only 370 calories and it s pretty filling They serve pizza and paninis too Great for a quick bite Anyway I have to go back and try their other things 
0FdCznOTQNDm-AD8pB0qPw Urbana I agree way nicer decor than the vaguely scummy looking one in Champaign The price is right but the food is extremely hit or miss the fried tofu tends to be leathery and everything I ve ever ordered that came with a non curry sauce has managed to be both bland and cloyingly sweet The curries make up for it but make sure you order it about twice as spicy as you think you should 
0ffY1gUKtAch_uyIwl_mSA Urbana I didnt think that I would find a mexican food place that is this great on my college campus I have been there many times and havent been disappointed once The food is great The service is great they know everything there is to know about their food and they are great at helping you choose your meal Service is fast If you are ever in champaign Maize is a must 
0FQwVXYGZO-M1CSt0dLc0A Urbana I was hesitant to come here but it is super close to my fiance s work so we decided to go I ordered a side salad and my fiance and I split an appetizer of nachos They were really salty and just well not good My salad was fine but I had asked the waitress to put the dressing on the side and instead it was slathered everywhere We also split a burger which was decent but very very heavy I think I maybe had 3 bites of it My partner also ordered a drink special a Long Island Iced Tea that came back to us blue They said it was the Illini special though I have no idea how seeing how our colors are orange and blue and not light bluish green Bottom Line Save your money and support a local restaurant instead 
0hnG1Zxkmgrv-SiLPwloaQ Urbana Just tried the Prairie Fire restaurant this evening I went thinking that it would be TGI Prairie Fire occupies the same space where TGI Friday s used to be Since I was already there I ook a quick peak at the menu before deciding to sit down Compared to TGI the number of menu items are very limited it seemed decent enough and so a friend and I decided to give it a whirl I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla as an appetizer Pretty average nothing really to rave about But I figured that you couldn t get too fancy with a quesadilla For the main course I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and my friend ordered the Southwest Chicken Cajun Pasta The bed of rice with the Teriyaki Chicken was okay but what was supposed to be Teriyaki Chicken was grilled chicken sans teriyaki sauce Not even the smallest hint of Teriyaki When I requested a side of teriyaki sauce apparently they didn t have any and only used a marinade Anyway I was not at all pleased with the Teriyaki Chicken I would give it a 0 5 stars My friend ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta This was also nothing to rave about I can make better at home Food wise it was a pretty lackluster experience Not worth the 45 Prices didn t really make up for the lack of quality either The one star is for the fairly decent service 
0I16FnUEGV442FsbaYBdhg Urbana I d give it 4 stars for the margaritas and the service Our server was really nice and attentive The food though has much to be desired Last night we went there and I got chicken tacos They were so horrible that I only took one bite My friend got the same thing and she also didn t eat more than one bite They were that bad The chicken tasted like it was canned The chips are good and the salsa isn t too bad either They re generous with the chips and keep them coming good thing too since that s what I ate for dinner since my tacos stunk Good place to go if you re just looking for ritas and chips 
0ibGwodYjhhCXpZCR3iAoQ Urbana The first time I ate here I wasn t too impressed but when I ate here the other day I was blown away The beef stroganoff crepe was out of this world the taste of red wine and mushrooms was ever so slight yet in perfect proportion to the overall taste And the coffee was probably the most delicious cup of joe I ve ever had The mrs loves the baguette french toast and the bloody marys are outstanding as well The smoked salt that is used to flavor the butter is also spectacular There is an amazing amount of flavor packed into each grain of salt Very cool Overall I highly recommend Carmon s for breakfast 
0iIWyxnfrl5XhzxBPgjQpQ Urbana I am pretentious and I love pretension Carmon s offers pretension and delicious taste all at once I came in for brunch this morning and loved the atmosphere the overdone fin de siecle details and the crepes I had a delightful buckweat crepe filled with eggs and bacon that was far more classy than a savoury breakfasty thing had any right being I was also incredibly nervous as I was sitting with a Harvard professor and talking about Woodrow Wilson or perhaps just from the very strong double espresso they whipped up here Speaking of coffee if you get a chance order a cup of regular filter coffee They ll pour you a refill from a ginormous metal coffee urn that looks like it was filched from Scheherezade s palace No seriously it does Or from Toulouse LaTrec at least the John Leguizamo version Well worth a trip for brunch 
0ImO0vrAJL8_tm9vuC4-Rg Urbana I love the daily specials I eat here every time I can which isn t often because they are only open for weekday lunches I think Such delicious food and definitely a worthwhile place to give my 5 for lunch too 
0iTD1eGrc_Wk-DC7smoeGA Urbana First off the food was fine Nothing I can t get at the other two made to order burrito places nearby but good But in a world with so many burrito choices I won t be going back to Pancheros The service was kind of slow but they did just open so we ll give them a pass They didn t have enough food prepared which forced us to wait while they made small quantities that they were bound to run out of again soon They said that s what happens when you cook fresh I dunno maybe I m in the minority here but I don t really mind if my cooked veggies sit in a warming pan for a few hours Another thing about the food they are VERY skimpy on the scoops I ve never noticed this at Chipotle or Q doba both of those places ladle it on like they re fattening you up for market But this place was seriously measuring out very scant scoops of rice beans cheese everything I got a burrito bowl and it was maybe half full And yet I paid the same price as my husband who got a burrito which has a tortilla that the bowl doesn t include What s up with that The parking here pretty much sucks if the place is at all busy and you enter through the Jimmy Johns drive up lane so have fun maneuvering around the cars waiting in line The shared building with Jimmy Johns is just odd the signs for entering and exiting the parking lot only say Jimmy Johns so it makes it seem like this place is a little tacked on Nope won t be back 
0jALHCBseiEy0rFy-OW6dw Urbana I am not a HUGE fan of smoked foods Most of my experiences with smoked meats ended up leaving an ash tray taste in the mouth or really dry meat But at Black Dog I LOVED IT My husband cleared his plate faster then I have ever seen and said straight away that his food was the BEST smoked pulled pork he had ever had I had the beef brisket and damn it was good Can t beat the price tag I mean really If I remember correctly our bill was less then 15 
0kEPMEjCXXlDMzkQ_Xdbdw Urbana This place is awful The only thing that bamba s has is that it is open late enough that if you are drunk you may eat it Just NEVER during the day I got massive food poisoning from here The only reason it gets two stars is because it really is a part of campus nostalgia Everyone knows bambas 
0kHVu5I-woG58zod3_JKyA Urbana My favorite Indian restaurant The food is fantastic and the service is great 
0kl4wPxs1pMddshecXxkag Urbana Wow this place has really changed now they occupy two spaces instead of one One space is for formal dining while the other is more casual and laid back We sat across a huge purple bar The menu was much different than I remembered Instead of entrees like half chickens with grilled plantains etc they offered Tapas which we didn t mind at all In fact we love Tapas The best Tapas we ordered was the vegetarian paella I wished the paella was served on a big platter like in Spain but it was just in a tiny side dish which I understand is part of the whole Tapas mentality but still I wished they d offer it on the menu as a main dish The margarita I ordered was spot on Not to strong not to watered down And their prices are extremely reasonable We spent 47 00 without tip for six tapas two margaritas and one dessert which we shared I still love Radio Maria s but I like the decor on the older side better 
0Kn1D6f80JbeHTiGnduflw Urbana After a long work day my friend J and I needed some booze and sustenance and she came up with yet another Champaign winner Interior is stylish minimal and dark Our booth was large and comfy Our waiter was knowledgeable and just friendly enough Can quickly become pricey if you stay a while and dive into the small plates and drinks I was overwhelmed by the drink menu and ended up going with my old standby the dirty Martini My first one with organic corn vodka which made for a smooth sipping drink Loved it J tried two different drinks so I got to try them too over the course of our dinner both of which were delicious and pleasantly spiked with liquor We tried two different apps the Beer Battered Bacon and the House Olives our 2nd choice when we were told they d just run out of the deviled eggs The bacon was not greasy at all and the maple chipotle drizzle was the perfect topper The olives were meh just not necessary and I don t think my opinion was swayed too much by the fact that I really really wanted those deviled eggs Next up a la carte soup I went with the Beer Cheddar soup which was close to great with discernible beer and cheese flavors J chose the soup du jour Cream of Asparagus excellent fresh asparagus flavor here Both soups were wonderfully creamy Bowls were decent sized for 5 My entree was a Thai shrimp and noodle dish I m a sucker for coconut curry sauces Nice amount of shrimp but no noticeable spice to the dish A bit of a disappointment J s beer brined double pork chop was an amazing dish not to mention huge Perfectly pink pork We parked in a nearby parking garage as the lot across the street was full I would return and try everything new other than my Martini 
0kr30u-okifEGetnjNeWGg Urbana We went for an early Saturday night dinner drawn in by new fine dining in the area which is limited and the promise of local farm to table style We are huge fans of many local farm efforts which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall and now Big Grove Tavern First the food from a foodie perspective Fresh product well selected and well cared for The flavors of the natural food are highlighted The preparation is often minimally invasive The technique is classic French The flavor profile is quiet My partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder For example the deviled eggs a pre starter have yolks mixed with peas We would suggest adding an acid note perhaps a pickle It was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks a feature at BGT The flavor of the night was white truffle oil and you could taste the oil That was a real win For starters my partner had the chili and cornbread and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb I think mine was better really delicious with rich deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through The farmstyle whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch The cornbread was a bit too refined it needed more crust and less cake more corn flavor and less cafe baked good sweetness The chili was savory but mild no real taste of chilis The entree and dessert courses were both very good especially dessert My partner had the short ribs which were beautifully medium rare not a hint over or under I had the roast chicken with dumplings which was amazingly good Crisp skin moist and flavorful meat with a delicious herb broth under Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still not at all cooked out The portions seemed just right not too much and not too little For dessert my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme Both were really superb refined flavorful rich balanced Nothing fussy just satisfaction in every bite with very good coffee on the side they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery a fine choice The food is not bold Or experimental Or imaginative But it is good very good much better I thought in terms of technique than Carmon s Bistro It s clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending People who don t necessarily like a chi chi dining experience will enjoy the food and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless Second the decor and atmosphere I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for although the dark colors dominate a little too much despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options BGT has a chic young vibe somewhere between casual and serious Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling black wire cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area outdoor party lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks one off note the planks have lumber yard stamps which may be a bit too low end for what they were going for fairly inexpensive light wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs if a bit flimsy and booth upholstery I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior There s seating outside too if you re a smoker or don t mind getting it second hand Third cost Yes yes it s on the expensive side BGT is fine dining not family dining I won t be eating here every night either Of course any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree rather than getting the whole shebang I d guess for dinner that this would run you 20 25 tops But if you have a deeper pocket that night the whole shebang here could run you 100 with tip for two and you still won t feel cheated The value is here given the quality of experience Fourth service BGT has a young eager service staff They took good care of us and every other table I could see From beginning to end we enjoyed our time here 
0LBiCH6ScF9_8KjkvSplhQ Urbana One of my fave go to places after a night out on Green St Sometimes waiting in line was even more fun than going out made friends in line saw people throwing up passing out getting in fights Never go in the daytime though the only respectable time to go is when the bars close and you re craving Mexican food Two words SUPER NACHOS Steak is the best They put a bunch of toppings on there it s well worth the money to get the super nachos YUM The best part is the CHEESE it s this delicious white melty cheese they plop on top If it weren t for the cheese we would never go to La Bamba s 
0mN1Gms9tD-Zo1QLm6gmqw Urbana After about two slices your stomach is going to be tapped but you ll still reach for a third slice Be careful over eating here is commonplace This is really good Chicago style pizza especially being so far away from Chicago Has a crisp crust soft gooey melty cheese flavorful sauce tender meat Definitely the place to get your pizza fix 
0n7M9z_CIEpu0KQi4WyOcQ Urbana People come here for the bubble tea and hotpot Those are OK but the rest of the food is wildly inconsistent A lot of the food I ve ordered has had an off taste The bubble tea and hotpot would make up for it but they are also quite rude here They won t explain basic things and there have been many instances of people I know getting kicked out because they had finished their food when there were tables free 
0omRADihiWW18egGN_3vxw Urbana This is a place that is fun to go to if you just left the bars and have the munchies The food is okay oily not that great tasting either The employees seem a little disgruntled I have seen people bring work here and eat I don t actually understand why It needs to be a lot brighter for me to come here 
0osa4GRW8rUbUF5gFDE0kQ Urbana If it s possible to have fantasies about food It would certainly involve Pokey Stix I have been hooked to this place since 2004 For all the damage its done to my arteries and heart I still make a point to make a pit stop when I cross Champaign Urbana The Pepperoni Rolls are are gooey with love and awesomeness but those pokey stix are the crack that keep me coming back Please expand to Chicago We have enough fat college kids here that will keep you in business for centuries I heart Gumby s 
0Q9zwx6DUlB6htkliT5eNw Urbana Yes this is ramen Instant ramen But it is OH SO SATISFYING Seriously I come here at least once every 1 2 weeks I crave it Long run and need electrolytes RAMEN cure Itsy bitsy hangover RAMEN cure Monday RAMEN cure The pre configured combos are the way to go here you get 4 5 toppings appropriately styled for 5 and there are many vegetarian options The portions are great massive even and the staff is super friendly Recently they released bing su shaved ice desserts that are also super tasty and refreshing with fresh fruit and mochi red bean condensed milk etc if you are into it love love love 
0QHCY_55TFHHvyumEMpDew Urbana Good stuff Pricey by normal pizza standards 
0RQ-dmROUjQv_34ELskTNg Urbana The food was quickly served and service was nice but the food was a little eh Had Pad Thai eh and Pad Kee Mao spicy but lacked significant protein Easy spot close to campus but there are probably better Thai places around the area 
0S1sTYd4c16LHPfy3wgc5A Urbana I love Monicals and you can t beat the family deal Formidwextern pizza Monicals is hands down my favorite 
0sB7VB3IZpJiHTRpPRfMFg Urbana I went with a Chinese friend who ordered in Chinese When one of the dishes arrived and she didn t like the look of it she then shouted a lot at the waiter in Chinese After that the food was exceptional Easily the best Chinese food I ve had in Central Illinois I admit that s a low standard However I ve never been able to recreate this experience And how I ve tried I ended up asking my Chinese friend to write me a note in Chinese ordering these same dishes from the Chinese menu I show the crumpled and worn note to the waiter when I go by myself But the food is never as good I expect it was the shouting Now that my friend has moved away I expect it will never be that good again Without my friend to help us this is a mediocre place 
0SnXNhHbogELJ8tPZyOjdg Urbana i don t know why but i wasn t expecting this place to be any good i guess maybe because i m a die hard bombay grill fan and didn t expect it to be up to that standard well i was 110 wrong i had a chicken tikka masala chana masala combo and it was absolutely delicious the staff was extremely helpful and polite and the outdoor seating was really nice on a sunny day this place deserves a big thumbs up yum 
0sR8OgwAiBzriRyM0W1sEQ Urbana Oh Firehaus I really wish you were better but with your normally absentminded waitresses and bartenders who on weekend nights are stuck up how can I really I think that you re tolerable on Mondays when I can kind of hear myself think the bartenders are the new ones and not completely jaded and I can drink cuervo silver margaritas for 3 But Firehaus my experience with you is generally bad The lines are ridiculous the music is overwhelmingly loud my friend s credit card got closed out to the wrong person and had someone else s drinks on it and his last name is not Smith or Jones or anything common What You did to get on my last nerve Once I was there and a seasoned bartender dipped a glass in the ice bin and it came up broken which means there was glass in the ice bin I pointed it out and so he got another glass and dipped it back in the same ice bin with glass in it Gross Their food is OK but overrated Bah Firehaus I will definitely not miss you when I move away 
0sSSTqlFyJWx2poxukHVNA Urbana Noodles and Company is an okay place for lunch and by okay I mean not that great It s located on campus which makes it an easy destination for lunch They serve Asian style noodles Italian pasta and American pasta think macaroni and cheese etc They also have soups and salads You get to pick your size regular or small and can add ingredients such as meat if you like I tried a couple of the Asian noodle dishes they were alright but really not too impressive I wouldn t mind so much if they were a dollar or two cheaper 
0svlJAQuN7UcbSf-c5kIfw Urbana Tried this place around 5 30 on a weeknight and it was not at all busy It did start getting busier towards the end of the meal but our service was good Luckily for me I had not been highly anticipating the opening of Destihl The beers were good enough There were about a dozen to choose from so if you drink beer at all you should be able to find one you like The night we went in we were given free 2oz samples of as many of the beers as we wanted to try I tried the Belgian Strawberry Blonde and Raspberry Wheat Champaign Blond and Frankengluten good flavors but none will be appearing on my all time favorites list The Frankengluten was interesting and worth a try if you are adventurous Our waiter was nice and attentive enough but could not properly give drink recommendations since he was not old enough to drink I thought this strange since clearly patrons are going to want to know about the beer The food I had the brie and portabello sandwich with chips The chips were average and the sandwich was bland That s honestly about the best I can say My dinner partner said his steak salad was excellent and it looked fresh and crisp but I can t vouch for the taste We split the beer battered asparagus and that was by far my favorite item I will probably go back at some point for another try The pizza and a desserts sounded like they may have potential Second visit 8 27 11 Finally tried the pizza pesto and goat cheese and still really no change in my review Nice wait staff but the food does not overly impress You do receive a large quantity of food for the price Although for me quantity does not trump quality 
0SzF2s9PDqpwHNiIxNJqFQ Urbana Thursday 2 any pint and they have two brothers and dead guy on tap Yesssss Also their fries are probably the best on Green St and their burgers ain t too shabby either The only thing I can t understand is the ridiculously long line to get in after 9pm especially after the second bar opened inside ohwell grad students go early 
0T4zs45jK373Vha4TyYS7A Urbana Finally finally finally after years of trying mediocre fiestas toros haciendas and even chipoltes there is finally a place in Champaign Urbana to get delicious tacos Amazing corn tortillas made daily fresh ingredients chile de arbol and salsa de molcajete are more than enough reason to support this business In addition to the food I had the fish tacos a bargain at 2 75 and the most expensive taco on the menu the staff was super friendly and the 6 stool eatery made for an informal yet enjoyable dining experience Check it out you won t be disappointed 
0TdEosetwPrd4YPuujxUvg Urbana Looking for an omelet using my Yelp Mobile application I ended up at Radio Maria I was hoping Sam s Cafe was open with a more diverse breakfast menu but to no avail I would head to the trendy read odd Radio Maria Not Maria s Radio because who has a radio now a days I don t even have an Pod so I am one to talk about technological advances We were seated on a Saturday afternoon during the beginning of Restaurant Week in Champaign They were setting up all along the street for a big festival so I figured we should get somewhere quick before all the drunks show up haha There is a dining room which is where we were and a bar tapas area Seems really trendy hipster and urbanized You re definitely not in the suburbs of Chicago anymore I went with the Greek omelet that comes with house potatoes and beer bread to which I got fruit instead of the potatoes I also got a grilled plantain That s a banana almost different genus species for all you biology nerds out there Total for two people was under 20 Waitress was great refilling my water but she had too much lipstick on and didn t really seemed pleased to see me which was disappointing because most people love to see a short quirky medium skinned Yelp Elite member Not Ashley who was our server Oh well Will I go back Probably not but this makes the grade I used that pun because I am a teacher who teaches things to people hahaha TURN DOWN THE DAMN RADIO MARIA 
0tjtUCW5vJId1ok5jk1H5g Urbana There s something about this place that makes me like it more than I should Maybe because it s open until 3am most nights Or maybe because I simply have bad taste Either way you can t deny the thin crust pizza here It s cheap good and will fill you up which in the case of thin crust is a rarity I m giving this place four stars because every time I ve ever ordered from this place delivery or takeout the people working are usually slammed but still manage to be prompt and courteous 
0tWrL6If_OTRaEyUiRzAtw Urbana This place reminds me of this insane NYC spice store with every spice in the world It s overwhelming Aisle after aisle of spices All kinds of rices jams etc I bought some Greek mountain tea that I ve been wanting to try This store should be in Chicago or one like it If you are driving by Champaign this place is worth a pit stop It s always fun to just look at food crap 
0TxXfnVX8Wz_QBftgcOaNg Urbana Took my family to Kamakura to celebrate my wife s birthday Our food was very tasty our chef was very personable and entertaining We had a great meal and I m looking forward to going back Highly recommended 
0uFpIgQVx713eOQW22lJ4w Urbana My fiance and I never would have heard about Maize if it was not for an article about them written in the DI This very small hole in the wall restaurant is truly a hidden gem The tastefully decorated building is very small and has limited seating which honestly suits the quiet intimate atmosphere perfectly if parking or seating is a problem you may want to show up during off hours such as after 1pm or before noon perhaps We visited during break when campus was empty and had no issues The owner was very friendly chatting with customers and explaining the different items to us and offering his recommendations The portions are very inexpensive 2 4 on average and on the small size so that you may mix and match different items My fiance and I each ordered 2 chicken tacos and then shared 2 quesadillas one filled with pumpkin blossom and one with huitlacoche We had never had either filling and they were AMAZING The corn tortillas are all homemade a little thicker than usual and really good We were also offered free tortilla chips which were also thicker than normal perhaps made in house Very good with two delicious homemade salsas and lime A delicious and filling meal for two for just over 10 not bad at all In short this place offered some of the best Mexican food I ve ever tried It is extremely authentic and much lighter than the more stereotypical heavy refried beans sour cream cheddar cheese oil drenched Americanized Mexican fare We will be returning next week to bring a large order home to my fiance s family in town 
0UFsGBg30kqR9gI8xl9esA Urbana Love the atmosphere An awesome place for getting into a great conversation with someone The shake is very customizable u can mix different flavors you will find your favorite after some good digging and experimentation 
0UPxosi6pfg1128nKL49Aw Urbana Spoon House is a great place for lunch I love the Mex Asian fusion bugolgi burritos as well as the the traditional options on the menu The food isn t the best Korean food I ve eaten but it sure hits the spot when I m craving some bi bim bop If you have never tried Korean food Spoon House it s a great place to start The menu is full of popular Korean dishes and if you re not feeling adventurous the burritos and tacos are a great alternative 
0V3TTWedPdmuCqcOtRaolg Urbana Among all the Southern style BBQ places around campus Li l Porgy s is by far the most authentic and flavorful Frequent promotions made it hard not to go to Porgy s for at least some of our weekdays Their southern sweet tea is wonderful In comparison to the other Porgy s by the Original Pancake House I ve always thought this one to have a stronger smoky flavor 
0vdh9mnFmQEQ-bv1n38esg Urbana The food is alright but it s probably only worth the price if you get the discount with student id have a coupon for half off or have a coupon for a free stir fry Have been there a few times in the last few months because I had a coupon for a free stir fry and the service was terrible each time The waiter forgot to bring water drinks to the table several times after walking by and reassuring us that he ll be right back with water The waiter never came to check up on us throughout the meal to see if we needed anything and we needed more water at several points As for my food the last time it was not that great The sauce combo that i made was not good and i should have had one of the servers mix my sauces make your own sauces can really be hit or miss Finally when we asked for our check it took our waiter another 20 minutes to bring it then another 10 to bring a carry out box Overall the stir fry is decent but i would recommend having a server prepare your sauce mixture whenever I prepare it it never comes out quite right and prepare yourself for not so great service because the servers are mostly college students who are working for mediocre tips 
0VfioGn8htha1hPEawb2dQ Urbana Once upon a time this place was good but I can t say that s true any longer I believe that the tapas area is a good bar but not so much a good restaurant Go to Cafe Luna for better and cheaper food I used to enjoy the other restaurant They still have good free chips and salsa that you eat while you wait for your food The actual stuff on the menu is not so good Also they haven t changed the menu in the last half year Everything on it right now seems Spanish inspired and some of the things aren t so inspiring to eat UPDATE I went here for drinks the other night I am not a big fan of their table set up even though the bar was pretty cool I think they must not have very good bartender s working here on the weekend It took like five minutes for them to figure out how to make a rum and diet Coke And it didn t even taste right It was like vanilla rum or vanilla Coke But to their credit I heard they have good mojitos 
0VhavmG379gBYVE5-2Cenw Urbana I love Lil Porgy s sauce I don t like spicy foods but their mix sauce is just right I almost always get their chicken sandwich with mild sauce and a cup of the mix sauce Their sandwiches come with an order of fries They also offer potato salad pickle spears and a few other sides I can t remember right now Definately worth a try if you like barbeque 
0vm21DGu4FbW8sZv4l3m9w Urbana There are several restaurants here in Chambana that want to be like the Big Grove but this place is the real deal So happy to see it open We tried a little bit of everything last night and it was all very good as described midwestern classics nicely prepared with a twist or two We started with cocktails and bar bites split a salad main courses and dessert Our favorites were the cucumber y patio pounder cocktail tater tots and amazing sweet potato waffles Overall too I was most impressed with all of the vegetables which when they were cooked were cooked to crunchy perfection and beautifully balanced with spices and sauces It s ironic then that the one weak spot on the menu is veggies I m a mostly veggie eater and it s always a bit depressing to see only one vegetarian main dish the complex and creamy macaroni and cheese which can be made without bacon I m confident that vegetarians could put together a good meal from sides and salads and the lovely whitefish works for pescetarians like me But the chef is clearly talented and so I d love to see the menu rounded out with a few interesting pure veggie options Either way I know that we ll be back to explore further Next time we ll have to be early enough for my husband to try the burger 
0vQnAwe9p1kDzr16jHoDMg Urbana I have eaten here a few times and never been overly impressed with this place Last night I ate here and ordered the Tomato and Pesto grilled cheese Huge mistake My grilled cheese came out with one slice of hard dried to the bread cheese on two huge pieces of Texas toast It was so dry I had to ask for marinara sauce to dip it in just to choke it down So not worth it flavorless and disgusting Kinda like how I feel about everything else I have ordered there OK for drinks but avoid the food Oh and don t bother complaining to the GM Andy He could care less Way to keep customers 
0xoBmGQ2bmXBhYpy7hCByw Urbana Lunch Buffet Awesome Much better deal than 1 sushi They had korean glass noodles red curry egg rolls tempuras some kind of soup and 3 sushi rolls and probably more stuff that I left out The food was all good 
0XXWMIsjs7q9ARt8Gwutng Urbana Fair is stretching it The ribeye was a low grade supermarket cut Not on my list to revisit in the future 
0yeeY75fpWHDN4ipaCULHg Urbana I have to agree with what previous reviewers have written the food is sub par especially considering the price I have yet to try the sushi there but I have had the cali rolls which came with the box they were precisely what I had expected This place is alright when you need a large pile of food and you re at everitt and you also need to run through the rain and you d like to limit your distance to about one street crossing sarku is right up your alley 
0zcZmN0END6mS6ZsOJ3IZQ Urbana I just had my first visit to Spoon House and I really enjoyed my experience The owner came out from behind the counter and explained everything very well I asked for his recommendation on what to order as it was my first time I had the Beef Bulgogi quesadilla and I thought it was very tasty I mentioned to the owner that I like spicy food and he brought me out a piece of the spicy pork quesadilla on the house which was also very tasty One reviewer mentioned they didn t have Kimchi but when I was there they had little styrofoam containers with Kimchi sitting to the right on the counter for free I had some and also thought this was tasty as well It s super clean and very nice on the inside I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu and will recommend it to other people 
1-hvYmaH1fiU-VX9pGLQNA Urbana I absolultely LOVE gyros so this is a no brainer for me I feel like this place is a staple of quick delicious campus food It s pretty much a total hole in the wall but it s totally Illini everything about the decor just screams it Not to mention the gyros are bomb Go if you haven t already 
10g1MapRrho0mnE0eaw0HA Urbana I ve just got into the whole tapas craze and figured if my friends enjoy V Picasso I bet I will too Clearly I was delusional V Picasso formerly the office bar in Urbana is a wannabe tapas bar The only thing I enjoyed out of my meal was the complimentary olives the waitress brought us Everything on the menu that my bf and I ordered was unappetizing and the majority of their menu doesn t have any creative vegetarian options I ve been told that their sangria is great but to go just for the sangria would make no sense not to mention everything is overly priced Also let me add by saying around 8 oclock they ran out of the chocolate cake that I had been eying so much on the menu Well if our waitress hadn t forgotten part of our tapas maybe we would have ordered the chocolate cake in time for them not to run out Sorry but they were not attentive at all and took their sweet time bringing out our food I do understand it is tapas and therefore should take longer but seriously Overall I left the restaurant still hungry after ordering plenty of tapas and my bf left just as hungry with a lighter wallet I am considering going one more time just to make sure this wasn t a one time accident they had but for the price tag I think I ll be headed over to Luna for my tapas fix these days 
10yHjsF1BEhGcxbrAVJjvw Urbana McDonalds is generally McDonalds The food here is fine but service atmosphere is lacking They seem to have some sketchy clientele almost saw a fight break out here once Also they have very strict BBQ sauce quotas Unless you buy mcnuggets or chicken selects they make you pay for any bbq sauce you want 0 25 pack I think it s sort of ridiculous that you can t get free bbq sauce with your chicken sandwich 
12CJYDSsuinH9h8F-hAD4g Urbana Yeah This place is yummy In every way The burger was excellent made us want another one Fries were great My chicken liver P t was soooooo good with jelly and the bread was divine My Mac n cheese was good and smoky a little dry but could tell it was individually made and good Bartender Lisa was enthusiastic and attentive Can t wait to come back and eat Might have to get back in here tomorrow Lol 
13BnVwzhlhekMZEukeFe4Q Urbana I can see this would be a good group experience the setting of the tables lined walls with cozy booths and private areas for larger groups seemed appealing The food however was underwhelming What was ordered Bento lunch box teryaki chicken and sushi Spicy tuna was TERRIBLE Yes I like the American version with the spicy mayo but this was far from and there was some sort of spicy pepper mixture on top of the tiniest rolls i ve ever seen The taste was lacking and the rice seemed a bit stale The guest I was with had a beef veggie bowl and it was bland served in nothing more then a standard brown gravy with little taste Best item on the menu iced tea Don t waste your time The price may be decent but the food lacks the same feeling 
14TBnOWDTuZ6HxPcxeoY0Q Urbana Never again This is a terrible place for anybody looking to enjoy themselves If having fun is not your thing check out Fat City My second time here confirmed in spades the general feeling of badness I got the first visit The first time a year ago was a weekend night and they had a lot of people All the garbage that comes with a large half and half campusy crowd was there that time They had keg service outside in a busted little shed plastic cups long lines beer foam splashing all over and a full compliment of asshats Inside the place doesn t look that bad They have dark wood accents a selection of booths tables and a long bar They have 2 nice pool tables a shuffle puck table you dont have to pay for the machine to keep score there s an app for that now a new golden tee and a couple of other games that looked playable The second time I went was a Tuesday night I realize Tuesday is a polarizing night for bars but I am solidly in the camp of lovers of bars on the empty side A group of grad students I run with had called ahead letting the place know we would be coming en masse Many of this crew refused to come I surmise based upon how terrible this bar is So we had about 80 less people there than we warned them about ahead of time So the service was great right Nope The worst I ve experienced in Champaign Urbana Drinks took literally 20 minutes One bartender with ADHD had a system for remembering what everybody had was running around like a chicken with his head cut off The guy was really trying but he did not do his job efficiently at all he would ask you what you wanted listen to the very first thing you said then turn away and get right on it before you were done talking He would then stop preparing your drink order mid way to take care of somebody else and their extended family He would then serve up your drink and act like you were the jerk because you wanted two additional drinks Those three drinks will cost you 9 plus 20 35 minutes of your life This system led to a half dozen or more people at any given time stuck in the purgatory between ordering a drink s receiving said drink s and paying for same The music system sucks A really muddy sound that makes old standards hardly understandishable and the bar artificially loud In the nearly empty bar described above it was hard to hear even those near to you and doubly hard to communicate with the bartender It was easier to hear elsewhere but they must put the speakers over the bar so the bartender can t hear complaints The food sucks Terrible selection of boring pub grub standards of BBQ d meat fried meat crappy frozen crinkle cut fries On Tuesday they have 2 00 margaritas that are TERRIBLE Bottom shelf tequila plus too much bottom shelf margarita mix over ice no blend option Oh yeah there is an old guy sitting at the end of the bar talking loudly to himself The aforementioned sound quality makes this even creepier as only occasional strains of his soliloquy find their way through the muddy garbage music they play here Classic Rawk 2 steps below NOW I really thought about giving this place 2 stars for the following reasons 4 bottles of good beers like Rogue Dead Guy and Bell s Oberon and a shuffle puck table new Golden Tee Pre Yelping the place in my head I was resigned to give them 2 stars as a recognition of such efforts even if they were not reflected in positive results Then my buddy got his Blue Moon draft in a plastic cup 
16x8SW5KTDRjyasR2Q16ag Urbana Been here so many times It became one of my to go joint every time I go home from my clinicals Love their Pad thai and Pho The Pho is a little different in this place its has more flavor in it than any other pho I ve tasted probably because of the celery Yes celery Best thai ice tea in town hands down I enjoy their Mongolian beef and Tom Yum soup as well I love the service they serve their food pretty quick The only thing I m concern about is the tray area is a tad filthy and they could ve clean the area more often than leave plates their for some time But who gives a damn they got the best food ever 
17NtaSBMfUsKGYyy63Wpdg Urbana This isn t the world s greatest pizza but it s what Pizza Hut s pizza used to taste like back in the 80s before they started being bad It s greasy buttery crunchy and tasty I know that doesn t say much for those who never knew what good Pizza Hut used to taste like but it was very nostalgic to me Theyhave hand tossed sicilian pan this is what i had and deep They have a lunch special of two slices and a drink for 5 They have either pepperoni sausageor cheese and unfortunately they won t add any extra toppings to it grrr There s only one bench in there so there s no dining in Another grrr It wouldn t be my first choice for lunch in that area but s a decent alternative if you re craving for a quick greasy lunch 
19PjtTdRpoz-VyyRPGOyvw Urbana This is by far the best Mexican in town And that said it is also one of the cheapest places to eat I know it is near campus but it is sooooooo good and I recommend it to all I eat there at least once a week and I have yet to be anything but happy 
1aabcMlwVBmkOgZwo-2jdA Urbana I ve eaten at a lot of great places in my absence so prepare for a string of gushing reviews Despite being extremely busy on a home game day our group of 4 was able to score outdoor seating pretty much right away Our waitress was nice and as attentive as she could be for having to wait on 10 tables at once You could tell the cafe was going for more of an old school thing with it s antique register wooden everything menu items etc For brunch on such a gorgeous late summer day my friends and I knew we HAD to sit outside I can definitely see myself coming back to relax with a newspaper book and a sandwich Plus I hear their milkshakes are pretty good so I guess I ll have to try that out as well Did I mention their portions here are pretty much huge My friend and I split their Dagwood and Desert Dippers healthy right and were STUFFED afterwords The quality of the food itself wasn t anything special but it still hits the spot when you haven t had anything to eat all day like us I ll be back here for sure 
1abeApkseFIPYRLonCPh2A Urbana This is one of those restaurants that makes me wish I lived in Champaign Urbana again Even though it s been open for years I didn t go until recently We went for a brunch and the food was amazing My wife had the french toast and something eggy Probably an omelet The french toast was fabulous I don t know what kind of bread they use but it s perfect She was able to taste some of the egg used but I just tasted lovely golden syrup and cinnamon The cuban was served on a fresh baguette The meat was terrific and so was the bread The american fries I think that we each got with the meal were perfectly cooked and seasoned The decor is very cool nice artwork hangs on the walls and because it s downtown it s close to Cowboy Monkey The Art Theatre and The Virginia theatre VERY highly recommended 
1AOHwZUIRWCnFhCLV-fKrw Urbana They serve excellent Tong Yum noodle soup 
1B-J5wByoL6QC927GTjeFg Urbana First of all I really miss Gillian s That place was awesome Aside from that I ate here once with my boyfriend Initially I really liked the interior and we were greeted immediately However we did make the mistake of coming here during Graduation weekend so it was packed and the menu was limited We didn t wait that long surprisingly and the food was pretty good but I really want to come back when it s not packed full of students and their families so I can try the rest of the menu and hopefully give this place another star or two 
1BRgh6Wgh0v_vNveaJShBA Urbana The Bread Company is one of the best restaurants in C U If you think that the reason why they are selling out of different entrees at dinner is because of poor planning it is obvious that you have never worked in the restaurant industry Dishes sell out at the Bread Company because they are popular duh There is no way to predict what will sell what night and if you are upset that dishes are out of stock you should be showing up earlier to insure that they still have their full night s supply As for the service being poor it s true the servers are mostly college kids that could give two shakes about their job but the food is so incredible it just doesn t matter to me The head chef Daniel is honest to God a pure genius when it comes to creating new dishes and I never order off of anything but the specials menu Trust me when I say trust Dan with your dinner If he has a hand in creating it it s bound to be amazing 
1BW--n7SRAtRqKE8rHMl7w Urbana Great salad bar and service but everything else is terrible Do not waste your money 
1CLE0burI_36WAC17NmpCg Urbana Wow I used to think that the Burger here was one of the best ever not anymore I was in Champaign last week on a Wednesday evening Murphy s was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm I ordered a Mega Bacon Cheeseburger and fries Sat at the bar and had to ask the bartender if he could please wipe off the bar in front of me because it was all messy you would have thought I called him mother a dirty name Service here was terrible The burger Much smaller than I remember The fries barely edible they were like eating balsa wood that had been deep fried All in all a terrible meal I won t be returning not with all the other places in town now where you can get some good eats 
1DCPH7cgmKtQi5QFuAW1-g Urbana Visited the first time a few weeks ago I got the Bento Box chicken teriyaki for dinner It was a LOT of food I don t for CA rolls so I passed that to my bf Everything else was great though The BF got their chirashi and he thought it was great He has been back and said it was good on his second visit 
1dj0fMMeUs-WE1Q-8xpGAw Urbana This is likely the best Mexican restaurant in town I ate once at one of Rick Bayless restaurants I was sitting in one and ordered off the menu of the other Yes weird He s the go to guy on Mexican cuisine in the US competed on Iron Chef etc I enjoyed my meal at Mas Amigos more My wife ordered the Steak with poblanos It was perfectly cooked tender and flavorful The poblano chilis were beautiful I ordered the Chicken enchiladas with mol sauce I am a big sucker for a good mol and this was a great mol The chef makes the sauce on the premises with dozens of ingredients It is complex and flavorful Mmm Just thinking about it I almost forgot that the sauce was served with some fabulous chicken enchiladas tender tortillas wrapped around moist and tender shredded chicken These are the enchiladas and sauce that the others in town should aspire to be one day The chips are also made on the premises They aren t exactly low fat but they knock Chevy s chips to a far distant second Likewise the salsas In addition to the dish of fresh salsa we were served two made here bottled plastic squeeze bottles salsas a red smoky and firey and a green that reminded me of summertime I used to think that the beans and rice at a Mexican restaurant were a very optional part of the meal Not here Both are surprisingly tasty and of very good texture Although pretty full by the end of the main course we are suckers for a good Flan We were not disappointed Texture and flavor were spot on The service was friendly and attentive This place is doing so much right they really deserve to succeed We will definitely be returning here often 
1dMAY4jp5URVM-fmejt2aQ Urbana This place USED to be fantastic and the only reason I m giving it two stars instead of one is out of reverence for the memory of what it used to be When The Great Impasta was in downtown Champaign a few years ago it was always top notch and I never had any complaints But since they ve moved to Lincoln Square Mall in Urbana It s been consistently bad I went there a year ago and swore I d never go back But I caved a while back and returned Again it was awful The pasta was overcooked and the alfredo sauce tasted like it came out of a can At least when I went a year ago even though the food sucked the service was very good But last time both the food AND service sucked And the price For me and my wife two entrees and a bottle of wine over 70 freaking dollars Seriously I should have stayed home and had Chef Boyardee Talk about flushing your money down the toilet And I m not sure what they were doing with their decor but they had pictures that looked like they had been printed out on an ink jet printer taped with scotch tape to the wall in every booth WTF This time I really am never going back I m afraid Urbana is where restaurants go to die 
1EarGnDwEvfn8WET2EnYVA Urbana I find myself in Champaign for a quick 3 hour meeting and I remember a coworker is an U of I grad He must know where I should go eat and he texts me back saying Zas Papa Dells and Geovantis He wasn t sure if Zas was still around and I wasn t in a deep dish mood One look at Yelp mobile and all I see are written down are Chicken Fingers Chicken fingers and chicken fingers So I come word to wise if you think you are hungry for 12 fast food size Chicken strips order 5 here They re that big If they had better beer on tap and buffalo sauce this would be 5 stars You re almost there Geos I wonder how many people come in late night stoned with the munchies 
1ESY4mybk3H9-Zayg8hF9g Urbana The chic decor dim lights and cozy booths set the intimate mood at Boltini Lounge There are also additional seating areas in the back to accommodate larger groups but especially during busier hours I think that smaller groups work best I love the menu s variety of selection to choose from My personal favorites include the crab cakes liar s club the sriracha sauce is absolutely delish meat a balls and grilled cheese that you can dip into shots of the yummiest tomato vodka soup The drinks are a little pricey but are always really good and stiff you ll get your money s worth The male servers during my first two visits to Boltini were exceptional They were knowledgeable hospitable and professional During my last visit however we had a female server and although she was polite she was very curt and seemed impatient for us to quickly order eat and pay as if it were a full house in reality we were one of only two tables during that early dinner hour Overall I would recommend Boltini The prices are reasonable and the food is pretty great If the good service was more consistent across the staff I would be more keen to give Boltini a straight 5 stars 
1f53tLGxPt30FTnvq842cg Urbana This place was poppin We had to park in the Dallas and Co Parking lot cause the Parking Lot was full The entire structure is pretty cool they ve been pretty successful with an attempt to Go Adobe Overall the food though wasn t that great I guess I might just have really high expectations for mexican food because I love it I ordered their Mexican Combo Dinner and got a beef tamale chile con queso chorizo enchilada and the enchilada was my fave 
1F5L5Tr9rlwawfTvyg8qRQ Urbana Another establishment I frequented quite a bit while the U of I I loved creating my own pasta dish with fresh veggies and delicious sauces fresh parmesan and a HUGE piece of garlic bread It was very reasonably priced and the upstairs dining area is very nice I took my parents here many times during moms and dads weekends and they also fell in love with Za s you cannot go wrong It does get SUPER crowded during lunchtime so go at an off time if you want to just waltz right in I need to go back and visit just to get me some Za s 
1fEAUbsDd8x3uV6IDsYGKQ Urbana With a very reasonable price list and a very varied menu it really is hard to get tired of this place Whenever lunch brings me to campus town I usually eat here There are discounts available for students that bring it down to the poor grad student budgetary range and the option to take home a bowl makes it an even better deal If you re new to this restaurant though be sure to either go with an experienced friend or tell the wait staff you re new there are a few insider tricks in preparing your food that you won t learn other wise One of the best is to always ALWAYS put the blue stick for bread in with your stir fry 
1FyNHVxez6IQBBn-2ZZjgA Urbana Ok I am a food snob from Los Angeles Just moved here and to be totally honest I think the food here is so plain Yes you have a lot of great steak places and American food but things such as Sushi there is NO good places I have tried each and every one and Indian are hard to come by We first went to Basmati and honestly I thought we were doomed There was no flavor and most dishes seemed to be watered down NOW we were driving near campus and we drove by Bombay and I am more then happy we stopped As for the other poster whos friends said its over spiced have you tried real Indian food This is tame in comparison The food is just right and always served fresh and hot The semosas are great and served with the best sauces We love the Gobi Aloo and chicken masala we will be back to try other dishes Bottom line other then the lackluster decor and sometimes dirty looking floors this place was a sweet treat for those of us who are used to some variety 
1GfTXm4lQCDnqsbHZENeMg Urbana The food is excellent I ve been there for both lunch and dinner My only complaint is the noise level can be loud They have done some things to quiet it down though like adding in tapestries Salads are excellent as are the soups and well everything Their guacamole is really good but hard to get at in the tall thin glass they serve it in 
1HBrqwCkkUQYiFJn4yWo3g Urbana How have i not reviewed Mandarin Wok yet I m a U of I alumni and this was the go to place for chinese peeps who wanted authentic yummy chinese food I know it sounds strange that a school in the middle of corn fields could have excellent chinese food but then again it s an engineering school so you know what that means The fried tofu is SO GOOD here I came back 9 years later for a reunion and the fried tofu was still amazing here If possible order off the mandarin menu and not the english menu or at least say you want the chinese style and not american style dishes yes they make it both ways I live in the bay area now and i still say this is one of the best chinese restaurants I ve had and especially for the midwest Definitely better than most places in Chicago 
1Hvlqjv9JJfEYDEtd6Ut-g Urbana I am not Chinese but my boyfriend is and he says this place is close to what his family makes so I believe him That said I ve had a lot of great food here Chen do chili chicken eggplant beef ho fun stir fried bok choy and a fried melon dish are a few of my favorites At first it can be confusing to order and I ve seen a lot of people look overwhelmed by the menu and people milling about the counter I say DON T WALK OUT Ask the lady at the register daughter of chef and she can help you Highly recommend 
1IIx_UCrS_Ij98D69P_o-A Urbana Overall this place could be good but is just a disappointment They have a great selection of vegetables meats sauces and other ingredients but even when following their recipes the food isn t that great It was extremely salty and just not very impressive I think that the grill maybe got my food mixed up with someone else s food maybe it just wasn t good Overall it was edible but I would never go back for the price I paid for salty mediocre stir fry 
1Iobyi_7BkFON25Oegs0aw Urbana Love their subs Cheap and top shelf ingredients 
1Iuiw1ZcRV2PkCj5RqPltg Urbana I finally got to try this place yesterday after allowing my curiosity to linger for nearly a whole Spring semester I love cajun spices flavors but this was only okay for me I ordered the Drunken Chicken bowl and while the flavors were pretty good I think I was looking for a little more heat However the portions were generous and if you re looking for something quick dirty this is a satisfying alternative to your typical fast food chains I ll be coming back to try some of the other items on the menu 
1jeOOnRgltiUQ-f6Pdtw_Q Urbana When there were no restaurants in downtown Urbana the Courier was a go to place The food was never spectacular and even the burgers which were a draw back then now when there are other possibilities for having a burger are actually quite greasy and fatty The airplane fan is very nice but can t carry the weight of diner food that isn t even really good diner food The shakes phosphates and sundaes are worth a trip and the cherry pie is nice too Breakfasts do have their fans but in my experience the home fries are always dry the eggs often overcooked or tepid and the it s not worth the wait on a weekend 
1Jt7F0Ckwt2Bs8zxROf8Sw Urbana Can t really state how much I love this place Hang out here a couple times a week as it is where my group of friends have always gone here On weeknights the place is pretty clear perfect for kicking a few back with some friends You often see people bring in laptops to do work over a beer or two It s generally quiet enough for that during the week On weekends it s certainly busier and louder but not unpalatable Music isn t absolutely blasted you can still have a conversation with the person next to you If you are here for food try the Irish nachos Absolutely brilliant 
1j_VVCjq518ou93df2YgvQ Urbana They have this dish called the diner stack wow hashbrowns two eggs sausage patty and gravy all on top of each other I also got a biscuit to go with it I am pretty sure this might be one of the worst possible things to eat health wise but damn was it good I dont think I had lunch that day since it was such a huge meal and great hangover cure The line can get long at this place for breakfast but it moves pretty quick and it worth the wait IMO Service is your typical diner service so not bad 
1k5yA_gXkNZn_LLAt3ZIow Urbana Generally speaking the service is good I ve had some bad ones The food is pretty good but the reason to go is for the brunch It can get crowded but worth the wait They make their desserts on site and make omlettes and waffles while you wait The meats can be overcooked but it s still all quite tasty 
1KbcRXRxMZ4x89HYMTCACw Urbana I have been here twice on a Monday afternoon around 4 30 having a beer and nachos I think the nachos are really good We have always had great service and it s never crowded because of the time obviously However I am not that impressed with anything Maybe I should try more items and then write a review But I also got a ticket while parked in the metered parking lot I know it s my fault for miscalculating but it still pisses me off 
1kwp7_uILTI0uVltyuUM6Q Urbana Pizza puff and cheese fries I LOVE YOU Ate it during a drunken stupor on Friday and it was so delicious I wanted to go back on Sat night 
1LbNRqIczHQ4JzeReouFfQ Urbana I came here after graduating back in May and my experience was pretty lackluster The food itself was decent pretty good when you take into consideration that it s sushi in Central Illinois The problem with this place is the service The place wasn t busy at all yet our waitress seemed a bit frazzled and the service was slow First issue was that we weren t given any napkins and had to ask once we were served food which to be honest isn t a big issue but it took over 30 minutes to get a couple of sushi rolls when the place wasn t busy Our waitress didn t really bother to stop and ask how we were doing during our meal When we were done eating our waitress asked us if we wanted some green tea to which we accepted However she left and didn t come back for about 15 minutes or so with no tea At this point we decided to just ask for the check and leave which took about another 10 minutes although she came back with tea this time If you have the time then Kamakura is a pretty good choice in terms of sushi and I ve had good experiences with their teppan in the past 
1lExalxlgrRQ0J1Py5jtyA Urbana Whenever you ask someone about The Ribeye their response is the same the salad bar their is FABULOUS When the best thing going for a steakhouse is its salad bar this should be a red flag The service is stiff and hurried but efficient The wine list is basically two choices white or red The menu is basically two choices steak or chicken The steak is a decent cut but hardly seasoned and served on hot cast iron skillets that mean your medium rare steak is well by the end of your meal and your medium well is a dried out hockey puck of jerky like ribeye All this while dining in a windowless cinder block building decorated wholly in orange and blue and surrounded by senior citizens equally decorated wholly in orange and blue But yes the salad bar is good 
1LsI-HUUWEqG16u4Uj6nYQ Urbana I really enjoy coming to this restaurant The food is generally delicious they have a great selection of appetizers and it s not too expensive I usually order a curry which always comes out deliciously fantastic and I have a love affair with the eggplant tempura Buuuut the last time I dined there I switched it up with a Mock Duck with Basil This dish sounded totally delicious and just to emphasize with the waitress what I wanted I made sure the dish was 100 vegan before proceeding That being said I was hugely disappointed when instead of mock duck with basil I got duck with basil This is after having the waitress double check that the order was vegan and me saying MOCK duck several times as she took my order So there I was a lowly vegan in a usually veg friendly place with a huge slab of dead meat in front of me This upset me far more than I could convey when they finally brought out the real mock somewhat ironic I know duck it was great It may seem like an innocent screw up back in the kitchen but as someone who has devoted the rest of their life to help end the suffering of animals I was no happy camper For this reason I can t give it more than 3 stars Go here you ll have a good meal but be warned the service is frequently slow and your order might get really messed up 
1m-8cvhVsGOVOOCimt-7Gg Urbana Corn Beef Pastrami with fries were gooooood good They serve Green River soda This place knows what s up I m not much of a deserts guy but you have to get their banana split Huge serving Great vanilla taste 
1M-zw9Bgo1Far8c2l8Rw4g Urbana In my two weeks in Champaign I have been here twice and am dreaming about my third visit Why For their beef udon I swear since I haven t found a good pho place this is the best alternative ever On a whim I ordered it and found myself faced with a monster bowl of delicious broth silky beef cabbage and a mound of cooked just right noodles Toss in some tofu or something and it d be yummmy sukiyaki My friends after I left my happy udon haze informed me that the seaweed salad spicy tuna roll and chicken teriyaki were pretty good 
1MVFwBqahb4Gon1Qp28vMA Urbana It is a terrible regret that I moved away before I had a chance to become a regular at Golden Harbor I ve been there once and the food was out of this world good You can have the americanized staples which are still good or you can get into the real stuff and just have an amazing meal I wish I could pack this place up and take it with me wherever I go It does have an odd cafeteria style service But it s BYOB which I would love to see more restaurants in C U adopt 
1mx_UbuCnk1nNWhy3P_S8A Urbana Keeping with the theme of a few older reviews below You can t say all merry Ann diners are the same because the 1 on neil street sux s compared to this one This one is cleaner and has a better staff that can actually break Into a smile or 2 Better food better food and better food 
1nPoHE-5qMy-u1P6YRVREQ Urbana There is nothing better than fried food specifically broccoli after some or many drinks at the Pig Service is usually good great considering the fact that they re putting up with a lot of drunken shenanigans Also you can get fried food to go and take it back to the Pig or Mike and Molly s 
1P-gfTAxaezPycmfkd4hXA Urbana This is fast becoming one of my favorite places to eat The veggies are all very fresh The atmosphere is great I love being able to have a salad and my stir fry 
1PEd39HijoUN48u-KCyUkQ Urbana To begin with I wish Yelp would change the meaning of the stars Two stars is Meh I ve experienced better and three stars jumps to A OK Perkins is somewhere in between The menu for breakfast seems pretty extensive I ordered a platter that included smoked sausage greasy sausage greasy and bland eggs done okay bacon spot on breakfast potatoes pretty good and pancakes so so I like that they leave a pot of coffee on the table rather than having you wait for refills from the wait staff It would have been even better if the pot was full and the coffee was good neither of which was the case My waitress was efficient and personable Seemed more like a pro waitress rather than some of these student types that serve with the attitude that says I m only doing this until I graduate and start my money making career so don t expect much Again not all student wait staff are like that but some are The place seemed clean and it wasn t very busy for a Saturday morning breakfast I ve wanted to try Perkins and must admit i went there today only because Courier Cafe was closed I will return to Perkins as there were some other things on the menu I d like to try and because the experience wasn t completely a bust Although I am usually a member of the Clean Plate Club I did leave behind one piece of smoked sausage a sausage link some potatoes and half the pancakes That says something SECOND VISIT My first reaction holds true the second time The coffee wasn t very good The eggs were okay and the potatoes decent Bacon once again was perfect The muffin french toast was awful and was left unfinished 
1PJqXYWUGaLXcRfROdBQxA Urbana I really only go here for the 1 sushi night can get pretty pricey otherwise Love the monday night sushi specials they make up a menu of 10 rolls that may not be traditional but are absolutely delicious like a grilled kobe beef roll or a roll topped with salsa I always order the sampler a hot sake and some edamame to start off They also have more traditional stuff for purists and a large organic menu of seafood restaurant style dishes Haven t found any other sushi place in town that is as good And it has a really cool almost over trendy atmosphere so it s a place you can go to for a special occasion or just whenever 
1P_rqImy1j37aEzPn0xHdA Urbana I passed by this truck so many times on my way to class Each time I dared myself to try it But I was scared I d never ordered anything from a truck before What if I look dumb Do they take credit What if they only serve construction workers Now I ve eaten there several times I ll give you all the facts 1 OMG YUMMMMMMMMM 2 No credit only cash 3 did I mention OMG YUMMMMMMMMMM All their breakfast options are amazing Even the black bean burger is great It did make me feel like I would probably raise my cholesterol significantly TIP Call in advance on your way from class They take a little time to get you your food But if you call earlier they usually have it ready for me after the 10 min walk over there 
1qcWiB6xOv8m8_hjxg7oiQ Urbana I was waffling between a 4 and a 5 on this place out of the 3 times I ve been here but last night really pushed me to a 5 We came for a birthday party we had a reservation for 6 but it wound up being 8 and they accommodated us with no questions asked 1 at around 6 on a Saturday and there were only 2 other tables seated in the restaurant Service started out a little shaky our waiter was quite young but nothing to complain about really Once we were all seated and had our orders placed the evening just went really smoothly which is really how parties at restaurants should be I think Though the rolls took a while to come out we all ordered sushi in one form or another we were sent out first a round of complimentary miso soup and then trays of beautifully presented banchan or Japanese food presented in banchan style Our sushi came out pretty much all at the same time though the waiter forgot one of my friend s second roll order until the end I ve only had the sushi here so I can t speak for the hot food but it is very fresh tasting and has clean flavor profiles It seems to be that the majority of the rolls are dominated by fish and veggies rather than cream cheese tempura style rolls which is a nice break from some of the other restaurants in town In my opinion the rolls are on the pricey side 6 for a simple maki to avg 13 for a special but I come from the land of cheap fish so Yellowfin is competitive for the market in town Finally the chef sent out some tempura bananas topped with mango sauce and caramel If you ve not had a tempura banana you re really missing out I guess what impressed me the most was 1 how seamless the service integrated with the table s needs and 2 the effort put into the presentation and quality of the food We were able to enjoy our night out without having to worry too much about really anything everything just flowed The sushi was beautifully presented with beautiful pieces of fish as well as intricately carved garnishes Bottom line When a sushi craving hits any day other than a Sunday or Monday I ll be headed to Yellowfin 
1S2abZGeHdCAoco0sK_l_g Urbana Gimme a break this is an imitation Mexican restaurant run by McDonalds I m from Urbana and I live in a very competitive place for mexican food San Diego CA The best thing that can be said about the food is a Its not expensive for the amount you get b It s unlikely to cause indigestion and c If you ve never tried mexican before this won t turn you away forever Otherwise compared to many other mexican fast food restaurants this one is highly forgettable Example L S CA West Coast much better a 5 star fast food mexican restaurant Example R National much better a little pricier than the one above and salsas not as good a 4 star fast food mexican restaurant and a publically traded company Example T B National Ok it s not really mexican but I enjoy their imaginary mexican creations such as the 7 layer burrito and their chalupas 3 stars 
1Tc9Y65WSins9jlWdKLIjQ Urbana All I want is for this place to do well It deserves it Basically if you survive the terrifyingly steep steps downstairs you ll enter what appears to be a speakeasy beneath the Unitarian Center And by speakeasy I don t mean Prohibition Chicago era hideouts for liquor runners I mean a Vegetarian Speakeasy for hippies the best kind of speakeasy The decor is eclectic and homemmade It basically looks like a co op and is inhabited by the usual college town cast of characters hipsters professors crunchy folk punkers and any person who likes great food I enjoyed my butternut squash bisque soup and was disappointed that they were out of cornbread today Keep that in mind and come relatively early to avoid having them run out of foodage Otherwise you should enjoy Go and at least check out this awesome local community spot that really seems to care about the area around it Good call One note they only take cash much like the Y Thai But really if you re eating on campus you should spend your money on places like Y Thai or Red Herring rather than the soulless corporate eateries lining Green Street in CampusTown And there s free wifi Hot damn 
1tWrpU9-vPOYP7em0_T-PQ Urbana So many lovely memories of going here twice a week at least with my boy We would order strictly from the Korean Menu if memory serves me right intestine shaped like squirrel anyone Excellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment 
1uoxcLw4wPrjH8fpB2XeWQ Urbana If you own a jeep or SUV and want a mini off road adventure within Champaign Urbana look no further than Papa Del s parking lot Parents be sure to watch your children very carefully when it s raining as there is no lifeguard on duty All kidding aside their pizza is great I usually go over the noon hour and pick up a slice of their sausage or mushroom pizza as a whole pizza is way too much for a singleton like me Highly recommended if you haven t tried it 
1Vd6P1db4CGsxoc8dd_TIg Urbana If you go to Sam s you probably already know what you re going for It s not for ambiance or subtle flavors or lunch it s for delicious breakfast food It s not exactly a new trend to sing the praises of small greasy spoon style places but there is a reason for that no 30 fancy brunch can ever really inspire the same satisfaction that getting gratifyingly greasy french toast pancakes sausage and hash browns for a few dollars can 
1VRoQl5ZqUlqUYrxa4ixtA Urbana Two words Pokey Sticks 5 stars for Pokey Sticks And yes on multiple occasions I have driven from Chicago to Champaign for a box of Pokey Sticks My college friends from FAR sometimes join me and we finish the box driving back on I 57 Yeah we act like we never graduated while eating the stuff For a Super Bowl party I went and bought several boxes much to the enjoyment of UIUC alumni present Too bad the Bears lost but the taste of Pokey Sticks softened the blow When I get the craving I would do the drive again in a heartbeat Who s in 
1wwBnefZofDE-5pzkDvtLA Urbana Garcia s was pizza at the University of Illinois for decades Ask any alum and they ll have memories of the squares that were served there and many more used to steal the nice plastic tray they came in as it worked well at home for microwaving They had a bit tomato hot air balloon they use to fly around campus on football weekends and some branch stores in Big 10 campus towns like Purdue Sadly Garcia s fell on hard times in the 90s They lost their flagship store right across from the Quad and folks had to hike a bit down Green Street to get their fix They then started skimping on ingredients switching to a pre made crust and other cost saving measures as the company went through hard times Alums still go back as it tastes a bit like it used to but new students generally are unimpressed and look toward other options The crust is kind of unique sometimes I wonder if it is fried and they had a good number of toppings that you could get on them Pizza by the slice is really a walk up kind of business model so when they lost their high traffic location they really suffered financially You used to eat there just to people watch Still worth visiting for old time sake and I hope they get back on their feet and get going again 
1X7kVjEtRrd8Mp6_RLHcmw Urbana Best bar food in campus town I always get battalian burger The bartender s here are fantastic I really love the service here and I always come here with friends when they visit I feel the negative service complaints may be from wiper packed weekends like dads weekend or homecoming where every bar will be backed up I love this bar and many of my college memories came from here 
1XK2nMXrUcOv6ODf1UqJNw Urbana Guinness on tap Automatic 3 stars from me On top of that there was no cover on a Friday night for those of us over 21 Another star for that Legends is a pretty laid back bar where you can get together with friends and have a couple drinks Not really the type of place to dance but there s Joe s and Cly s if that s what you re looking for In addition to Guinness on tap they had a handful of other beers as well as a pretty extensive bottled beer list Prices were reasonable too 4 75 for a Dead Guy and 4 50 for a Killians Another bonus was that the bartender serving me was very cute Definitely will be back in the future to grab a beer with some friends and watch some games 
1Yk8uU8nza9f54L5wDDobg Urbana While the value is pretty good the burritos are not really that huge come on people be real and their quality is very low Every type of meat I ve had there has been dry and stringy the beef in particular was barely edible The burritos sometimes aren t even assembled that solidly which may be due to the size but still they shouldn t fall apart and have such a messy puddle of dripping in the bottom of every wrapper I ve been here 3 times and I m never going back It s a step above generic Americanized places like Qdoba and Chipotle but it s still really really low quality food for drunk people who can t tell the difference Go to Los Amigos if you want decent Mexican food on Green Street 
1YVnGVCj7cv14aXsbO3o3Q Urbana Just your run of the mill fast food place Staffed by new people constantly it s not the best place to walk up to the counter and ask for a recommendation As far as Dairy Queens go though this one is just fine My orders have always turned out right and the blizzards always well mixed If you re looking for a quick guilty treat you can get it here 
1YYnd8eDdTG3egNQGhan9A Urbana The modern atmosphere is good for a date night or just hanging out with friends This place has traditional sushi as well as very unique choices as the name would suggest My favorite is definitely the Fusion Maki though it is a little pricey I definitely think it s worth the price because it s a meal in itself Also they have a great 1 sushi deal on Sundays and Mondays The menu is a little pricey though if you re not going on their 1 sushi nights 
1y_hEV8_gQP0mO7ByKfkMw Urbana I took my Dad here when he was visiting I was expecting it to be expensive but also to be a solid dining experience Sure it is one of the few very nice restaurants on campus but from now on I will go off campus to eat nice meals The food was okay The dishes were pretty small for the price Worst of all was the service It took forever to get anything done and while the waittress was very nice it was unpleasant Also it was too loud for my Dad and I to talk which was our main intention Lastly this was in the winter and there was a huge draft whenever anybody entered the restaurant that forced us to put our jackets on 
1zMpN2KvRVgZIzhwi9haBA Urbana Table side guacamole making was very good Nothing like watching fresh items being prepared Food was tasty and service was quick Salsa was a little spicy just like it should be 
1_3HEQWaafnH6a3y4rLQjQ Urbana The best part of eating at Siam Terrace is the historic Knights of Pythias Building in which it is located Tin ceilings 16 feet high add to the drama And the owner and his family are great folks We had an all sushi sashimi dinner and the boat presentation was a work of art The miso soup is perfectly prepared 
1_rx6vOJHS3wJ5HCjfqJfQ Urbana Went here once for lunch with co workers Seemed to be like just a little sandwich soup salad plus bakery type of place The food was average at best Unfortunately the reason for the low review was the price I paid something like 8 for a sandwich on two of the smallest slices of sourdough bread I ve ever seen and a handful of chips I felt ridiculously ripped off and was left feeling hungry Actually quite a few of my co workers with more money in their pockets ended up buying seconds just to fill their appetites It took a little while for the food to come out as well The sandwich wasn t bad just very average and ridiculously overpriced Soup and salad were the same I ll be staying away 
2-igE6hTkHRzgE3IPyUfxQ Urbana I eat here semi frequently because there is a lack of mid range priced restaurants in town that aren t thai chinese korean etc and this has some meals that I would classify as mid range in price i e about 8 for a meal plus tip and tax I think the food is ok but some of the stuff on the menu is just overpriced 
213FXdSegrq22YmwsdWeIA Urbana Hitting the big 5 0 0 with a great restaurant from my hometown The vitals Downtown microbrewery restaurant with a slightly hip industrial vibe Great food great beer Best part Small 4oz tasting portions 1 2 GREAT service Every time I visit my parents in good ol Chambana they have a new restaurant in town that hubby and I MUST try Or five This time Destihl was first on their list and they are so crazy about it they took us twice In ONE DAY First for lunch No beer this visit hence the second just lunch I had the Portabella Sandwich with Shoestring Fries and it was 100 delish Also on the table Stuffed poblano pepper Cuban sandwich Salad with ahi tuna Clam chowder I heard nothing but raves from the group Late that evening we stopped in for post dinner drinks and maybe a little to munch on We got three appetizers for the table Chorizo Potato Flautas Marinated Cucumbers there s some BITE to those suckers Brewmaster s Pizza yuuuuuumm and all got a few 4oz tasting pours The beer was fantastic some of the best I ve had Our waiters both times were friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the story my dad told more than once about his friend s first visit They were a big group 12 I think and stopping in before seeing a show in downtown They ordered food drinks then dessert There was a delay in the kitchen and they were kept waiting on their dessert for quite while they were now running short on time so one of the guys flagged down their waiter and told him maybe a touch rudely that they needed either dessert or the check because we gotta get out of here The manager came back a couple of minutes later apologized profusely and served their dessert Dessert or check and Destihl chose dessert Their meal and drinks for 12 were on the house It s those kinds of stories that spread your business name in the best possible way you chose wisely Destihl The guy s been sending over everyone he knows always prompting with you gotta hear how amazingly this restaurant treated me 
214LfiZqcj1PWdOM6auQYw Urbana This place makes no qualms about itself It is a solid Punjabi joint creamy curries paneer and all That said it s rather lacking in spicy inspiration both locations didn t feature any sort of kick to their curries However the lunch special is all bang for your buck I recently went here on a lunch meeting and my professor and I were able to split one plate and leave completely stuffed I m glad the only real traditional Punjabi Indian joint in C U isn t a disaster but it s nothing to write home about either 
22bOyxoN-JSPtFlKsvDhbQ Urbana I was excited to try Peking Garden after reading numerous positive reviews from here and other sites I finally had the opportunity to try it out after suggesting it to a roommate over other options Since I ve reviewed another Chinese restaurant and hope to continue doing so I decided it would be best to get the same dish General s Chicken I know this is not traditional Chinese but it is a common dish and is one of my favorites The first difficulty I had with Peking Garden is ordering They do not have a website and it is not easily found online Luckily I was able to find one on campusfood com Next I noticed that the entrees were sort of expensive my dish was 10 90 with tax This isn t too outrageous as the portions were relatively large but there are plenty of other cheaper options in the area After finding the menu and placing the order over the phone I was told it would only be about 10 minutes until our food was ready When we arrived around 10 minutes later our food was waiting for us at the front counter One thing that I did not care for right away was that the rice for both of our orders was included in one container This isn t a huge deal but would have been easier for us had they been separate My meal had pretty good flavor though it wasn t as spicy as other places Despite the flavor both my roommate and I noticed that the chicken was tough to the point it was chewy This is probably the biggest reason for my 3 star rating as almost all other Chinese I have had has been very tender Overall the meal was good but I doubt that I will be returning to Peking Garden anytime soon 
23pMaTyFZHq3Nz-609TwXg Urbana I ve lived in CU for 8 years visited both Merry Ann s locations at least three times and never had a decent bite of food Skip it and go to McDonald s 
25XOo9s3i1FT1FMzUaZXzg Urbana The best Mexican food in Champaign Urbana 
26WePdMt_GQuMZGfSCTmPQ Urbana When I read the positive reviews on Yelp I expected to fall in love with Bevier Cafe After going to Bevier Cafe yesterday with a couple of friends the good news is that I don t dislike the place We arrived a few minutes before the cafe closed and they were out of some of their entrees The food we got seemed to have been sitting out for a while and it wasn t as tasty as I anticipated Also their service seems kind of disorganized you take a tray tell the people at the counter what you want pay for it go sit down with an empty tray and then the employees bring you your food Couldn t they just hand the food over the counter Or just have real servers Even with the not as good as expected food and the confusing service I like the concept of Bevier Cafe I m happy to support a student university run restaurant and I will eat there again 
28MW4VK4zg_7BUA4vffc4w Urbana The food is really fresh and delicious but you ll find yourself bumping elbows with your neighbor a lot if you get caught in one of their periodic mealtime rushes Their kitchen is larger than their dining area There is also no bike parking here at all but even that cannot dissuade me from repeatedly patronizing the best Mexican restaurant in town They are vegetarian friendly Try their delicious corn smut Maize if you are reading this Get some bike parking Seriously 
28xEtAJN-ojheDxhA_3vDg Urbana Sam s Cafe has a Lebanese dinner menu now like Amanda W said which includes the staples such as hummos with a delicious puddle of olive oil crispy falafel Greek salad chock full of feta overstuffed dolmades tabbouleh baklava not homemade w pistachios Two highly recommended plates you can order are the Shish Taouk chicken kebab or Breaded Tilapia one of their specials The woman who started the menu recently emigrated to the US after the tragedy in Lebanon Go support local business 
2AZMsdJ5-X4Rikn62Ado3g Urbana If I lived in Champaign I would be in trouble World Harvest is amazing Take every single ethnic market you can find and put them all together Add an olive bar artisan cheeses fresh baked breads and all of the worldly chocolate you can handle including kinder chocolate and Mozart balls and you have World Harvest They not only have spices and dry noodles but a large selection of frozen ethnic foods a wall of balsamic vinegars and olive as well as other oils ad did I mention the chocolates They also had a bulk nut and dried fruit selection to choose from Jordan Almonds scare me but I digress The bakery items looked freshly made and the staff was very friendly They will let you try any of the deli cheese or olive selections before you purchase 
2Bh8IVQFtYbmlVYGmJuYfg Urbana Just walked there after walking across the street from the Hampton Inn Glad I went there the food was fairly authentic and tasty I got the fajitas for about 11 which included chicken and shrimp The salsa was zesty and flavorful I would recommend it 
2bVlRdYpbTJRLJ1dIsZOqA Urbana While UIUC seems to have plenty of chinese take out joints and pizzerias along Green Street there is a surprisingly small concentration of restaurants that specialize in true Chicago style hot dogs Sadly though the Hot Dogs are just ok While the hot dog itself was a typical vienna beef sausage that I am used to the condiments were second rate Especially the onions which are grilled rather than raw Maybe it s just a personal preference but eating a hot dog with grilled onions just isn t the same The fresh cut french fries however were outstanding and thankfully they come free with everything making this place a good pick if you are looking for an incredibly cheap meal 
2CNLaafTmLCYqrp6_e0Qjw Urbana I love Crane Alley They have a great selection of sandwiches at reasonable prices and the best beer selection in town I find the Friday Saturday specials are always creative and amazing You can t go wrong with the frequently offered Beef Ragout Nachos but bring 2 3 people to help you finish Seating outside is quite pleasant except then you miss interacting with the friendly bartenders inside The service is friendly with just the right amount of attentiveness and they are nice to our dogs 
2dBdz4JPtI-aSdYvtQtQVQ Urbana Awesome range of food and beer and the atmosphere is nice This place has to be one of my top 5 in Champaign Urbana especially in the summer when you can sit in the actual alley itself Not to mention this place is great for some low key billiards and beer after dinner 
2e5ldmyi7S2xvm7GX--mHw Urbana I came here for lunch and had the seafood risotto Based on the atmosphere and the reputation of the restaurant I had pretty high expectations Unfortunately the meal was very average and rather on the bland side The desserts on the other hand were outstanding This place probably deserves another shot but based on this one experience I am feeling underwhelmed 
2E7unFUHEVYDbubYD49SGA Urbana This University of Illinois campus fixture has the best Sicilian pizza due to the crust cheese sauce sausage not to short change any of the other additional ingredients pepperoni mushrooms etc or the thin pizza or the cheese garlic bread or the OK I m a fan since the late 70s oh am I showing my age A proof point is that while driving Columbus OH to Chicago I went through Champaign just to pick up a pie to go 4 stars versus 5 is due to the ongoing problem of table management during rush periods where tables will be empty between seatings while there is a line of people waiting out the door around the corner That being said once seated service has been consistently good through the generations of waitstaff that we have had And other than football weekends seating has not been a problem The bar is fairly well stocked Oh this last round I had bacon and it was 1 4 strips on the pie FANTASTIC 
2eN5IuegTj6V0fyxT9xTDg Urbana Update Had Zyggyz again and I liked it more The beef curry was good chicken tikka masala was a big sweet for me but ok 
2EyB1R5zPUa-HE2OY2AvZg Urbana To be blunt I m baffled at the amount of love the burgers here received on Yelp Really just not that good The meat was dry and overcooked the toppings were boring and it was pretty small The only reason this place received 3 stars from me was the OUTSTANDING soup The roasted corn and poblano chowder was absolutely delicious I wanted to stop by the nearest U of I frat house and borrow a beer bong to take down a vat of this soup yea it was that good Overall the Courier Cafe just feels kind of old kind of like the burgers taste but do yourself a favor and order a giant bowl of that soup 
2eYJwlGz5r6wDUxAd_KXfA Urbana Many of their dishes are still average but I branched out and had their grilled mackerel on my last visit Oh My God It was DELICIOUS So apparently if you order things on the menu that most Americans wouldn t the food is awesome 
2F5J51OYtD49eyIUKJKVgg Urbana Love their pizza They used to have a great takeout special on Monday s not sure if they are still doing it Something like 6 for a large 
2gn97nC2eksQXUJy2dkryg Urbana It is a small crowded place serving inexpensive and ok food But I think it is over rated in yelp 
2GtfvFsEwyq-Ef6yp5HXKA Urbana The absolute best Italian sandwich I ve ever had anywhere especially when on wheat bread Seriously order the Italian it s so good I rarely try anything else And it s dirt cheap 4 a normal sub 
2gWJqidEH2f1NmdRew5HBA Urbana This is the worst chinese food I have ever had in my entire life I ordered the sesame chicken combo which came with fried rice egg drop soup and an egg roll The egg roll was fine the egg drop soup was slimy and so thick it seemed like a gravy not a soup The fried rice was your standard rice but the CHICKEN was where I was DISGUSTED It was all fat and gristle cooked beyond the point of recognition and there was hardly any white or dark meat to speak of I ate all of the rice and egg roll one sip of the soup and one piece of chicken A total waste of money I also doubt they could pass any health code inspections because this chicken was NOT chicken 
2h1BHzhitC9ktYXcTfNqfA Urbana Beer flights and food were amazing here We had a very cool server and the atmosphere makes you want to stay and drink several beer flights Best BBQ in Chambana 
2hVRmaARCryLLmFDf40ivA Urbana Went there for a sandwich at noon Only 2 other tables were occupied I was with 2 other people Took 1 hour to get our food My sandwich was burnt Waitress was apologetic Made me a new one in 15 minutes Skimped on the meat it was mostly just bread Thought they were having an off day but apparently every day is an off day after reading these reviews I hear it s fun at night but I d skip going there for meals 
2iGoOl48fn6u0704ntJw1w Urbana If you re looking for something a bit more upscale than Za s on campus and Biaggi s is out of your price range Manzella s is the place to go The portions are big but are slightly pricey They have a small menu but their speciality is a make your own past dish They also have a handful of baked pastas which I found to be good as well 
2Ja-f64hX-wFjiWQVnv9CQ Urbana I like it enough to come back The grilled Hawaiian sandwich is good but crispy borderline burnt tasting today Their tuna salad is really yummy They are pretty skimpy on salad dressings and a few times I ve had some wilty yuckiness in my field greens salad Nice ambience though and good outdoor seating 
2ji2h2cUDhZzTyAhXaDqKA Urbana We haven t been to Silvercreek in years we were disappointed with the food Rumor spread that they got a new manager We decided to give them another try The Chef s Line Burger is best burger in town no exageration Even my wife thinks so and she does not like to eat burgers Tonight we enjoyed the appetizer buffet with oysters chicken shrimp salads artichoke dip fresh fruit and chef cooked steak on the grill delicious You must try the Peach Kuchen to finish your meal Silvercreek is now our local favorite If you haven t been lately you must give them a try 
2JrfSxLh4NArxqhW5ZgxFA Urbana After a fun filled fish fry rehearsal dinner friends and I gathered here for a night cap or two or three It was mentioned to us by the beautiful bride to be to try this place Wonderful high ceilings comfy curled couches interesting bar seats cute bar staff well okay the girls behind the bar and a very mixed crowd But what were we here for Well myself and the rest of the crowd wanted a beer my friend wanted some girls he could hit on I won Were there girls he could hit on here Yes so don t get me wrong on that account but not the skanky girls he was interested in We sat at the bar I poured over their menu rather impressive About 8 to 10 different dirty martinis as well as a multitude of drinks and wines Plenty of imported and micro brews abound Food looked pretty good as well but my stomach was full from munching earlier but on the other hand if it wasn t I would have chowed down I do have to say the staff behind the bar was hustling their butts off so I allow the waiting a bit to get some attention to slide Yet I didn t understand why the bartenders were also serving tables as well perhaps some one called in sick Yet they were still friendly and even made sure my friend s martini was just right when he said it was too dirty for him Even a DJ was spinning some tracks I do have a weird feeling that this place is trying to do too much perhaps with the competition of bars in the area they are trying to serve an everything under the sun atmosphere in a more upscale college town I really liked it and if I ever find myself in town again I want to stop by here However I need to find a driver for this town to whisk me away back to my hotel Finding a cab is harder than finding a Michigan Wolverine fan here 
2JvmN5rziE-Wce7VdAWYFA Urbana I don t think I share the opinion of the other reviewers It looks okay but not super trendy This place is a ripoff and the food is just not that good The teppan is okay but they dump a bunch of sweet and sour sauce on everything The lunch buffet is not that good The Korean dishes are okay but I think I would rather go to B Won The sushi is okay but really expensive and not that good I would rather go here than Ko Fusion but that s not saying much 
2KVZMURKlYSyi2ueugc-0A Urbana I always enjoy the chipolte steak soft tacos and the black beans 
2lLxkoZYQzFhVGIGhr5wjA Urbana I was extremely disappointed by Bevier cafe during the 2012 summer On many occasions the food was inconsistently portioned or prepared For example the country fried steak on several occasions was extremely greasy with oil oozing off of batter a clear sign that it was not cooked at a high enough temperature When broccoli and beef over rice was offered take out orders simply were not portioned with enough food For a dish over 5 there should be more than two pieces of beef Items billed as hot sandwiches arrived cold with cheese not even partially melted As this is a student run enterprise let s hope that the Fall batch of students are more detail oriented and the quality improves 
2Mf3F2OuPgPUG9FF6MXrBw Urbana I am from Champaign raised there until the age of 20 when I escaped to Austin I still go back every year for Christmas to visit family and friends and when I do Seven Saints is a must hit place for food And I get the same thing every single time The Triple S Combo Platter One salmon slider BLT salad although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad sounds weird but was really tasty And the tomato basil soup This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off possibly a bad day But every year it always pleases me And the bill isn t so bad I don t really drink here but have had a mojito that was alright nothing special I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting Please stay in business Seven Saints otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won t be pretty 
2mZDfcy6E2SMaTv-UZWr1g Urbana Geovanti s is the best place on campus to get your deep fried grease fix Don t expect health food or vegetarian options because the very blue collar cooks throw everything in the deep fryer This place bills itself as a bar and grill but the nightlife is mediocre at best On Friday night usually there are usually 3 or 4 guys in the basement bar sipping cheap American light beer 
2N1FEdeZtlPMKALiUJeHXg Urbana I had heard about this place about 6 months before I tried it out and I m mad at myself for missing out for so long The food is affordable for a student on a budget and the atmosphere is perfect for a date or group outing It s the perfect place for students to bring their visiting parents too The beer comes in sizes ranging from 4oz to 16oz so you can try different brews if you re in the mood for that The Tomato Bread salad is absolutely phenomenal and I have added chicken to it and had that as my entree on more than one occasion This is one restaurant I really miss since graduating U of I and leaving the area 
2nj4SrKu7DS2q0qwpg-i9A Urbana It can be good it can be bad Never attempt to order food for delivery from here It will take well over an hour and be ice cold and mushy There is much better drunk food There is much better sober food Chipotle is better than this Qdoba 
2nSiqOVmLzsxRJQvwPkoRQ Urbana If you re looking for cheap authentic Mexican food this is the place Yeah the place isn t the greatest looking place to eat but the food is fresh and flavorful I really like the different choices of meat on the menu besides just chicken and beef My friends and I ordered some chips and guacamole as starters and the guacamole was very fresh In addition the place is also a grocery store with meat spices avocado and etc The price isn t too bad at the grocery store at all The avocado seems fresher than the ones you would buy at the big chain grocery stores If you want a recommendation on something from the grocery store I would ask the owner who works there He s super nice and friendly 
2NsQve6UYvWAsLZqZ9S2vQ Urbana I stopped in to try the lunch slice special It was as it is advertised 2 slices of either pepperoni sausage or cheese and a bottled drink for an even 5 I chose a slice of pepperoni sausage I am very picky when it comes to sausage on a pizza and this sausage was very good too me The pizza didn t remind me of Garcia s The two crusts and flavors are very different I really don t like Garcia s sausage at all I always pick if off The pizza left my hands and face feeling very greasy and that totally grossed me out They have no napkins so make sure you are prepared for that I would like to note that someone in our office ordered the Hawaiian pizza for delivery and I tried a slice of it and I thought it was really tasty but then again the grease is what mainly gets me down I would like to try the thin crust so I might change the star rating if I think it improves 
2nvpDDJb1Zlwai4YARGkfA Urbana During weekdays I often stop by Rainbow Garden to pick up food as it has bargain lunch prices and is one of the few options on Neil Street that isn t fast food For around 5 to 6 you can buy a lunch combination meal that consists of a generous portion of your chosen entree rice soup and an eggroll My personal favorites are the chicken and green beans barbecue pork and snow peas and cashew shrimp Some dishes I ve tried in the past have been a little too salty and oily the Szechuan vegetables come to mind but I ve enjoyed most of the dishes I ve ordered Of the Chinese restaurants currently in the Champaign Urbana area I would consider Rainbow Garden to be the best option for a date The outside of the restaurant might seem somewhat unimpressive and grungy but the interior has a very sophisticated atmosphere with white tablecloths and dark red walls By American standards the wait staff might seem rude at times but their cold disposition is considered formal and polite in Chinese culture A previous review complained that the staff is unaccommodating and will not make adjustments to orders However I have previously asked the owners about special items and they have been attentive and considerate of my requests Rainbow Garden has also offered a special menu of delicacies during previous celebrations of Chinese New Year though from what I ve heard they might not be repeating this menu in the future still I think it s worthwhile to check on any potential Chinese New Year specialties 
2O9bSy91psHETv8ujexk8g Urbana Um Pokey Sticks are just cheese bread in pseudo pizza form They re okay I m not overwhelmed I m not delighted But they do what they re supposed to do I guess as a U of I grad student I m supposed to be enamored with the Pokeytasticness but as a former fan of Gumby yeah that s right 1980s cartoons were fun growing up and a fan of pizza I am required to say it s only okay That said the staff is really friendly But um not the greatest thing ever I guess my friends Pokey Prickle and Goo should all show up but that s probably the only thing that would make it at least remotely interesting 
2OMolFA7cWd9qs_pzIXkHQ Urbana Love the specials The Cuban is the best 
2plItngALXg8Y9NIPCZ1xA Urbana This place was awesome The service was great and very friendly We went for early dinner and had cheeseburger fries shakes and biscuits and gravy Everything was really tasty although diner y so you know it s probably not the best thing to eat every day Very well priced under 20 for all this good stuff and close to campus Highly recommend 
2prwLPcQvNvJ8ErRG5jC_w Urbana I went there with my friends who loved to try Korean foods We have tried bulgogi Brittos Budaejjigae bibimbap and dduckboggi Brittos is quite interesting Totally new tastes I heard that they have these korean style brittos and tacos in CA Probably these are from CA Budaejjigae is awsome Enough amonut and yammy spicy But too little Korean dishes I hope they can make Dolsot bibimbap soon which is my all time favorate korean food Above of all of that very clean restaurant especially restroom which is very important to me Clean and enough space for gathering friends and yammy food I will be back there soon 
2r15uCVW7im7Amk_Yn7P_A Urbana Ate here Saturday evening 12 10 11 for dinner with my girlfriend Ordered the Cheese Curds as an appetizer my gf ordered the Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese and I had the Ribeye Steak sandwich We both had two drinks with our dinner Cheese curds came before the meal and they turned out to be pretty good Nothing to rave about but average At last our meal was delivered The bun for my Ribeye sandwich turned out to be what looked like Texas toast As I peeled back the bread to look at my sandwich I was in for a huge let down This was the absolute worst excuse for a ribeye steak sandwich My biggest complaint it was paper thin PAPER THIN Literately speaking my steak was no thicker than a cardboard coaster The price tag on this steak sandwich was 10 This is my biggest pet peeves when it comes to steak sandwiches I don t mind paying upwards of 15 for a steak sandwich but I expect good quality This was such a poor excuse for ribeye I had to eat it with the top piece of toast off just to taste the meat How dare they insult their customers with such a poor excuse for a steak sandwich My gf equally hated her grilled cheese for reasons she will explain in her own review Once the check arrived 52 we asked to speak with the manager We both expressed our concerns with Andy the manager We felt like after spending 50 we should leave the restaurant full and satisfied Instead we were leaving hungry miserable and downright insulted Andy rattled off various reason as to why my steak might have been a little on the thin side He apologized for the size of the steak and offered us 2 free drinks to make up for our poor experience REALLY We spent over 50 and all he was going to do was give us two free drinks No thanks We refused the free drinks and made sure he knew he just lost two customers for good I m not looking for a handout I m not looking for my money back but the way he handled our situation was horrible If a customer spends 50 in your restaurant and absolutely hated the food two drinks is not enough to make up for this I expected a credit or a gift card to come back and give Seven Saints another chance Now I will never be back I can find steak sandwiches comparable to the one I had at Seven Saints at Taffies or Steak n Shake Keep your two free drinks Just know we will spread the word to anyone who will listen I hope you handle future situations better 
2RyYX7jw24ChPxX-y5Y2KA Urbana I went for lunch here in December and was rather impressed by the food and service I recommended the place to my friends and we went there for dinner yesterday To my dismay the food was bad enough that I feel compelled to write this review My friend and I had the saffron risotto and it was horrible It wasn t creamy in fact it was soupy and bland The risotto itself was underwhelming with more green peas in it than actual rice grains The shrimp was overcooked and tough Worse I couldn t even taste a hint of saffron Needless to say we were not impressed Another friend had the mushroom and asparagus linguine with prosciutto The pasta was of an unappetizing soft texture and the dish was overly greasy The prosciutto tasted more like salted pork Their only redeeming feature was the crab cake appetizer I don t think I could recommend this place to anyone after what they served us for dinner yesterday Definitely not worth the price would have rather gone to Cafe Luna or Bacarro 
2S8_EB_uYhGUU7ywpsmXLg Urbana I m sorry everyone Maybe it s not fair that I review this as I love thin crust pizza so much Maybe it s also not fair that I was served after the pizza was delivered and then I waited in line for several minutes Maybe it was the ridiculous hype that everyone brought with it that was its downfall With those things in mind one of the worst pizzas ever I took a quick picture on my phone see http www yelp com biz_photos u8C8pRvaHXg3PgDrsUHJHQ select KEIMjrhuV466cpYyYI8nhw and sent it to a friend He wrote back calling it bread lasagna Maybe it wasn t very good because it had been sitting out for 5 or 10 minutes after being delivered It had almost no flavor though And it was ALL bread I ve had deep dish before that was much better I would be willing to try it again fresh at the restaurant if I didn t live 1000 miles away 
2SE8_qC3P2v-FvUO9Bxd-w Urbana It s all about customization here You can create one bowl of stir fry goodness or for 2 more an unlimited number of bowls After assembling various grains veggies and meat you have the option of putting other add ons into your meal represented by different colored sticks I ve always been a fan of the blue stick roti flatbread beware it is kinda greasy This Flat Top has a roomy interior but the L shaped buffet bar is cramped They always have exotic beverages here like desert pear pomegranate or chipotle pineapple lemonade margaritas and mojitos Refreshing and trendy 
2SudWi2937SYnbdS37HR8A Urbana I had 2 different beers they were both pretty good I ordered the mussels Over half were not open I sent them back Second time about 5 were not open not acceptable to me The broth was good however I also had the pepperoni pizza It was decent My bf got the cod it was very tasty Next time I will probably try an entree It was very busy when we went but we sat in the bar Service was good 
2t0WS5MyXJaPIg_obcO_gQ Urbana I must admit it is taking a little while for this place to grow on me but mainly because I like simple food without all of the frou frou fanfare But I thought it worth mentioning that I had a fantastic hangar steak and garlic mashed potatoes there recently Very simple just meat and potatoes It was great And the restaurants is very nice inside as well we like the bar area 
2tva8WYjM47XMhcJB4PyPA Urbana I was going to Zorba s to have gyros until I explored this place and I m regretful about the time which I wasted in Zorba s Niro s Gyros on University Ave is a great place to have gyros Fast and delicious Also cheap You pay less than 8 for a value meal Also they have a deal when you get 2 gyro sandwiches you can get 1 free Only disadvantage of the place is that they have no indoor area because they work like a take away Anyhow this is the best gyros place in C U area 
2U5JgzZzGO1_TPqiAIK_3Q Urbana I had a very pleasant experience here The hostess who sat us was very friendly and helpful The decor of the restaurant is trendy but also inviting and it is a comfortable place to eat The food was delicious and I had a fun experience putting it together I was nervous mixing so many sauces and ingredients at first but it all turned out to taste amazing together I don t think you can really go wrong when making it The servers were very friendly also and I would definitely come back again 
2UlPYBI_4PhW98GeG6IHEQ Urbana The Garlic Pork is very good My family picks this as one of their favorite places to eat 
2UuPd_qoH2O0mW_G-dBezw Urbana DO NOT go here if you are looking for some chrome and glass ubermodern quail egg topped with scallion serving trying too hard to be trendy cafe DO go here if you are looking for decent Midwestern breakfast served in a cozy albeit kitschy venue for a decent price Woo for 1 Yummy biscuits that are an option instead of toast 2 Tasty sounding pancake options including the special that day pumpkin 3 A place that I can get an old fashioned chocolate soda Hellllooooo Boo for 1 A waitress who mistook my coffee order I got regular instead of the cinnamon almond which was the special 2 A waitress who slops coffee all over the table when setting down our mugs and then never cleans it up but clearly eyeballs the running liquid several times when passing by 3 Regular coffee that was so weak it looked like broth when I added a dollop of cream 4 Cold hash browns not that I had room to eat them anyway I was assured that the service is usually much better and more friendly I guess they were caught off guard with the rush of Dad s Weekend Menu options were enticing so I ll be back 
2VbfYqqxIQp0mk8G1ozU_A Urbana I have been here three times The first time my experience was awful What I ordered was uneatable and I sent it back and asked that it not be returned We ordered the fried mushrooms as an appetizer and loved them The second visit I decided to play it safe and ordered a simple sandwich It was bland and I didn t enjoy it very much Again we ordered the mushrooms and they were fantastic The third visit was so much better I ordered the fish taco lunch combo with chips and salsa and French onion soup The French onion soup was really good They didn t throw a bunch of croutons in it which is a plus in my book The fish taco was really good too I asked for extra chipolte sauce which made it that much better The chips and salsa were OK The chips were good but the salsa was on the bland side I also think it is somewhat pricey for lunch If you are looking for a better lunch deal then go to Friday s where they offer a lot more lunch combos at a much better price I will go back here again Especially with a group so we can order the mushrooms again They are so good Word of warning though they are big and I think you get 6 or 8 of them You will need help eating them 
2vLFhsiRTlYH0gtbAAVy_w Urbana I m a little too young to remember this place as R R s and I had stopped working here by the time they brought the shark bowl back but I was one of the first employees of this place when it reopened FINALLY as Firehaus in 05 This bar took a long time to get on its feet and by then I was tired of not making any money due to lack of clientle so I had moved on But now it s kicking ass and taking names and has a whole lot of loyal customers and for that I give this bar all sorts of props Also I just said props Ew Anyway the really excellent thing about this bar is that it is CLEAN Clean clean clean Even on Unofficial which is arguably the dirtiest day on campus all year the bathrooms at Firehaus will be clean The layout isn t my favorite as there aren t a whole lot of places to sit but the beer garden is excellent and the buffalo chicken sandwich with pasta salad was pretty damned good Of all the Cochrane bars on campus this one is without a doubt the best 
2VlWeAemTOxCUcehPRJhKQ Urbana First the good 301 Mongolia has a cool atmosphere great selection of ingredients for their bowls and excellent cocktails Now the bad The sauces just weren t very flavorful My husband had to go back to the buffet several times to get more sauce just to try and get some flavor The roti bread was only ok Finally we both got bits of food that were not in our bowl not cool If I want Asian grill I ll probably just go to Flat Top 
2vOfSkP0-ROueOKRT6Tolw Urbana Wow I will certainly be coming back And I will edit this review as fits I m new in town and hadn t heard of this place but my date had been here once before and enjoyed it We went on a Monday evening It s a small restaurant and I ve heard people complain about how it is decorated and kept but I really liked it It was clean and neat and small inside though it is in a strip of bars and other neon lighted windows If you think you re in the wrong place you might not be Once you get inside however it s decorated like your classic Thai restaurant We got the summer rolls as an appetizer and that was the beginning of the yum experience Very fresh veggies in a light wrapping dipped in a spiced peanut sauce I didn t think it could get any tastier until I got my dish a house curry with tofu I forget the exact name of it now I ll edit this later for it The first one on the curry menu though it s really worth trying I got a 3 5 4 spicy rating yes I did ask for the 5 thank you very much I like how they have this scale to be honest Anyways delicious Perfectly spiced not just in a hot way but in a everything is done right down to the last grain of spice perfect I don t even know how to describe it aside from that The tofu was cooked perfectly as well We washed it down with oolong tea from bags but this wasn t sad enough to keep this place from five stars If you know my ratings you know that means that this place was INCREDIBLE The service was also excellent we had two young ladies as our waitresses because one was training and the other teaching Unlike many trainees our waitress was very professional even though it was apparent that she was new The waitresses were very attentive and the service overall was very fast but did not give up any quality for the speed Anyways this place is a must try Oh yeah if you try and Google map this you get real Siam over in Thailand Just a warning Thanks Google 
2VqKNvzXvoiZ0OQNLugGuw Urbana I am not vegan or vegetarian but my friend is so I went with him and thought I would try it I had the BBQ seitan and for someone who doesn t eat that type of thing normally it was actually pretty good It had the look feel and taste of bbq pork I also had a side salad that had a yummy herb vingearatte I don t think I would go back again because I like my meat but it was definitely tasty and if you are looking for a vegetarian type of place definitely go check it out 
2vvB41Zwx03u0F44sgy_8w Urbana If you re too lazy to read my novel no judgment here is a summary Seven Saints awesome I m sure you ve seen a lot of 5 star reviews on Yelp and thought to yourself this person s 5 star is probably a 3 in my book so I think you need a little back story to understand just how hard it is to score the coveted 5 red stars in my book I m high maintenance I m also spoiled I m from California where there are actually more than six places to choose from for cocktails and late night dining It s not that I don t love quaint little Champaign Urbana but if a place doesn t live up to your expectations there are not many other options to choose from Ask any of my friends they heard me complain about this for months when I first moved here over three years ago Then I found Seven Saints This place excels in everything I look for customer service quality product and environment As you can see from the pictures the ambiance is warm intimate and inviting The seating and decor create an environment that is perfect for enjoying time with a date group of friends coworkers and even people you don t really like but are forced to hang out with once in a while Their menu has what I like to think of as fancy versions of classic Midwestern treats They are famous for their sliders try the Black Jack Slider come back here and thank me Or go for the hat trick and add on the Salmon Slider and California Turkey Slider and thank me three times The lovely waitresses waiters are always friendly and attentive It s amazing how they stay on top of tables orders when it gets busy As for drinks I m just starting to learn about beer and they have a wide selection to choose from Tuesdays they have beer specials which is a great time to sample things I wouldn t normally order And now for my favorite part Whiskey Wednesday I ve waited over two years to write this review because I treated Whiskey Wednesday like Fight Club it s so awesome you aren t supposed to talk about it The guilt has pushed me and I feel it is now time to let those of you who don t know in on this marvelous secret every Wednesday they feature 50 off their whiskey menu That s right This isn t a fake out Miko s 50 off either This is an unbelievable selection of quality whiskeys from around the world for half the price They rotate weeks from North American Irish Bourbon and Scotch in addition to weekly featured bottles I m not cool enough to call myself a whiskey connoisseur but I am very stuck up about my whiskey The two Whiskey Wednesday bartenders are amazing and are always able to find new and exciting things for me behind the bar They REALLY know their stuff Try it Go in and pick any whiskey off the menu They can tell you about the grain barrels aging process blend everything I can t even remember what I had for lunch yesterday They are extremely helpful and know the full range of whiskey flavors I ve been in many times with friends who don t drink whiskey often or are just starting out and want to go easy It doesn t matter how experienced you are the Whiskey Wednesday boys will take care of you Andy is the general manager and I can never say too many good things about him At most other restaurants you ll see the manager walking around to check things out but that s about it Andy introduces himself and actually talks to the customers He is always around to make sure people have a good experience It s a pleasure to listen to him tell you about the history behind a specific bottle or cocktail If you ve seen him on the CBS morning show you can tell how passionate he is about what he does So yes I just gushed about Seven Saints but I mean every word of it The quality products excellent customer service are enough to satisfy this high maintenance Californian I m also narcissistic enough to believe you ll actually come back on here to thank me Seriously Go check them out I ll see you again soon 
2WF9GuHilZU3I7pH6eVpSg Urbana Breads are all very good The espresso is terrible 
2xofgnLiwp-6xwbvv3vagQ Urbana This place survives because it is on campus and very conveniently located it is also the only restaurant within striking distance of the university that serves wine and has cloth napkins which means that it is full of administrators and professors The food is not at all good but it has no competition if you need to take adults out to a semi decent restaurant you can walk to from campus You should definitely avoid anything involving duck as a topping because it basically comes out looking and tasting exactly like pastrami from Schnuck s If you like that ignore what I wrote 
2xvzpV7vr2Q-Lzafr8hr6Q Urbana I ve only ordered through delivery here but so far my experience with this place has been excellent The woman who normally takes my order over the phone also tends to be the person to deliver the food to me She is a sweetheart and when I ordered from a different phone number than I normally do she recognized my address right away when I gave it to her and asked how I was doing What a great memory and way to connect with your customers Now for the food I ve only ordered a couple dishes from here but I feel no need to change my order any time soon Mongolian beef and the General Tso s is the usual First of all I love that they make no questions about making things spicy extra spicy The mongolian beef is ordinarily not spicy but when I asked if they could add some spice they enthusiastically said yes I haven t ordered it unspicy since The beef is sooo tender and the sauce they cook it in is to die for I literally would eat it everyday if I had a heart of steel The General Tso s is pretty good although not outstanding It s a little too sweet and saucy for my taste but I like to have something to contrast the beef so this is usually what I go for The only other dish I ve ordered is the Fried Diced Chicken w Red Pepper It s pretty much a party in your mouth Super spicy just how I like it the chicken is cut up small covered in batter and deep fried almost like popcorn chicken and salty which is awesome with a plain white rice The only reason I don t order this all the time is because it s a little too spicy that I don t want to always regret eating it the next day So I can t speak for a ton of dishes but the ones I ve had thus far have been very palatable And the delivery service is great Woohoo 
2xWRGXZCQ7TXE2OZA3d_mQ Urbana Great atmosphere and excellent deserts 
2y0ArxjBh-JpADw6cPV4pw Urbana I had the greatest experience at Esquire We went for lunch and had a waiter who was friendly talkative and helpful but not overbearing Our food was delicious came hot and was inexpensive The BEST thing was that we were talking about how we love Strongbow on draft and our waiter chimed in that he thought Bentley s had it and actually CALLED over there to make sure It was a wonderful experience 
2YERaYxp46o_EeIBXf7gsQ Urbana Love their juicy beef rice but not the cold noodle It s nice that they have free spicy bean sprout soup all the time Price is fair and service isn t bad 
2yPyUGI90e3Mwb4-5xdUew Urbana Still good food like before the fire but the salads seem smaller The new modern style totally ruined the comfortable atmosphere 
2ztAvHzboE76ggv0hBIkOw Urbana Very good food lots of interesting choices that are not available anywhere else in town A funky atmosphere and unusual ordering process but the service is fine for what it is Don t eat here if you want the typical sit down with a waiter dining experience and don t eat here if you are unwilling to take a little time to parse the menu They have English translations of it but come with Chinese friends and have more fun figuring it all out 
3-hsH7e0xLT6om8aT5EkfQ Urbana I ve eaten here all throughout undergrad and stopped by again this past weekend while visiting campus My absolute favorite dish Indonesian Fried Rice did not disappoint think huge pieces of shrimp and chicken in a bed of delicious seasoned rice with a spicy kick and the perfect runny egg to top it off They have really good authentic Chinese dishes as well Mapo Tofu Crispy Tofu Pork and Bittermelon Three Cup Chicken The owner is incredibly nice and overall the service is very friendly If you are looking for a no fuss place and delish authentic Chinese food or their more American counterparts Cashew Chicken Orange Chicken etc for reasonable prices you ve come to the right place Cravings I love you 
30cfxSUC-qKouiNgwZuFuQ Urbana I ve eaten the brisket of Texas and the vinegared pork of North Carolina I ve savored the best meats in Memphis and met Kansas City s Arthur Bryant himself Li l Porgy s is the best barbeque I have ever had 
30w4hR6Iv2kczijAfPpsHg Urbana Even back home in the San Francisco Bay Area it s hard to find a lounge where good drinks small crowds great ambiance and plenty of good seating mesh The seating at Boltinis is comfortable and intimate Think black leather semi circle booths with high backs in the middle of the room Towards the back of the room are black leather rectangular IKEA couches with glass tables and candlelight everywhere The drinks are large mixed well strong and tasty Personally I prefer a perfect half dry half sweet vermouth gin martini shaken You CANNOT go wrong with the cheese plates here Make sure to come at least in a group of four so you can order the 3 cheese plate You choose from a cheese list and it is brought out with sliced baguettes toasted and non toasted fruit green apple slices grapes and olives I would highly recommend the gueyere euro cream and the cheese infused with port wine But seriously pick and choose to your hearts content because the pairing of great cheese with great drinks will make you feel reallll sexy I exposed my friends for the first time to Boltinis last weekend and they were highly impressed with the classy setting quick servers and amazing cheese and drinks Even on a hectic Saturday night we found a nice seating area in the back of the pit for all 8 of us Boltini Lounge is a place that should stay hidden thank God it s in dtown Champaign and not on campus for its adventurous sick of underage teenybopper gangsta wannabes discriminating clientele I tell my friends that Boltini Lounge is where the people sick of the same scene at Joe s Fubar or even SoMa turn to We will be there again tomorrow night for a birthday EDIT Only downside is that they don t serve wine So unfortunately you can t bring your own bottle of nice wine to enjoy here But I guess you re supposed to be here for the martinis right 
319tG93Pgs4_UG8tlc-pUA Urbana This was my favorite place to get Gyros in town Despite the heated debate over who had the best gyros Zorba s vs Niro s Gyros I always sided with Zorba s the fixins added to the gyro tomato onions and whatever else you wanted were always fresh and great quality something that NIro s seemed to lack on more than one occasion Zorba s had daily specials like Groovy Tuesdays one dollar off classic gyro meals which kept me coming back every Tuesday I attended classes at the University of Illinois However on Wednesday March 23 2011 Zorba s was affected by the fire that started in the apartments above the business As of now I don t know when if ever they ll re open their shop on Green St But here s to hoping 
32HO_usYTWH0FKmje4maVw Urbana I ordered 3 chinese dishes from this restaurant It was AWFUL The food had no flavor and the meat tasted horrible I ordered authentic Chinese dishes but it was awful I do not recommend at all I couldn t eat two of the dishes and the third one three cup chicken was decent but nothing to write home about 
33GaASlC7ALqpb2F23oIcg Urbana Solid cheap drunk food And when you re having a greasy day don t want to cook and want something different Their gyros are the only thing good 
34Ds_2o8diz_pWZpfp2NGA Urbana Unlimited soup and quality bulgogi bbq I m also a big fan of the bibimbap and uh the cold buckwheat noodles and pear I have no idea what it s called but it s delicious 
36BUCiTzUoCBdwmJp4WZsQ Urbana Is it just me or is the guy who works there an ass I don t know if he s trying to pull a Billy Goat s type of act but instead of being funny he just pisses me off Other than that though it s a good place to stop by after a night at the bars as it s right smack dab in the middle of Green Street and fulfills your alcohol induced craving for artery clogging grease I wouldn t stop by for food during the day as there are many more healthful choices around Champaign It appears that everyone else agrees since Big Mouth s is almost always completely empty during the day You get some good deals and the food isn t too bad but I still wish it hadn t replaced Sushi County 
36eIadOPNhw_tuRAySNVBg Urbana Look I don t live here and I know nothing about Antonio s Pizza I was interested in learning about their pizza and so I ordered some Thing is it never arrived About an hour after ordering we called We were assured it was running behind and the driver had left 40 min ago Well at this point we were looking forward to the prospect of 40 minute old pizza but not to worry it never showed up We tried calling several times afterwards and no one answered I sincerely hope everyone at Antonio s is well and that some tragic incident didn t interrupt our pizza but never before has pizza just not showed up At least the courtesy of a phone call you ask Nothing 
37kZLjdTb0NKYntA9XY5hg Urbana This review is on their breakfast only as I have never been there for anything else I have now had the pleasure of ordering all of the 5 burrito choices that must be made before 11 AM Some of my favorites include egg sausage jalapenos and a queso sauce The best things abou this place though is the great customer service When not busy I enjoy talking with one of the gentleman who are working When it is I normally read the student run campus newspaper The Daily Illini that they place on each of the tables or just enjoy the pandora station they have playing over the air For awhile when I was going more frequently one of the employees remembered my name They also have free wifi which is great For me one of the best grab and go or quick breakfast options on campus 
39M43t0qGJhH4D5f9UEURg Urbana Best Italian restaurant in Champaign Urbana Great food great atmosphere 
3aij1bgsE1AgA53IIE52dQ Urbana Arrived in Champaign late on Christmas Eve and the hotel had stopped serving food We hit the snow filled road to find some grub actually I was pining for a piece of pumpkin pie The Merry Ann s near our hotel was closed but we spied another one that was open 24 hours It was as if I d walked into a time warp the menu the decor and the pricing was unusual for this California gal I was thrilled to get a piece of pie and even happier for the 2 price There s nothing on a menu for 2 in California not even a sharing charge My partner had a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich with fries It may have been the processed American cheese slices but she was hungry I m glad I wasn t too hungry because the vegetarian options were quite limited and if I d stuck to my veganism I d be SOL 
3AmrQUGQ9B60Sourn5g10Q Urbana Pretty awesome Mediterranean food for Champaign I ve only been here once but my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it Our food came quickly and while we were waiting we watched what seemed to be a Middle Eastern version of MTV which was pretty entertaining We also didn t spend that much but walked out with a ton of food leftover enough for us to eat an entire lunch the next day The only downside of this place for me at least was the atmosphere and decorations I thought it was a little weird and disconnected but if you come in for a quick bite and just want some good food it s a nice spot to go 
3AtqdrOXEJWfDwFddGuemA Urbana I love this place Plenty of people have written about the food too many amazing dishes to list but I could live on the sweet potato fries and the ribs and the beer the selection is so good and it rotates and it s so cold and delicious But once you get spoiled enough by the food and you start to take it for granted because after all you know that it will be fantastic and you don t care if you have to wait and you don t even care if you have to sit at the weird little time out table in the very back you start to ask yourself the hard questions What exactly is it that makes this place so amazing What is the one ingredient that brings it all into harmony Well after twenty visits I ve figure it out It s that waiter You know the one The ironic hipster with the glasses and the longish hair who knows every single thing about all of the beer selections and all of the food and who is probably the guy responsible for the fact that Tom Waits is playing and you can just hear it under the really loud sound of the game on the tv at the bar This guy is free from the shackles of his hipster tribe because he s nice He s kind He will figure you out and he will use this knowledge responsibly This guy will tell you everything you need to know He will not patronize you rush you brush you off or forget your table He will shine his magical hipster doofus sparkle charm on you He is the patron saint of this restaurant Go there and ask him to tell you what to eat and what to drink Obey him Thank him Seriously who is this guy I love this guy 
3AzM1iJkdD5wg4s2j26usQ Urbana One of my favorite restaurants in town Not only their ribs are good but the sweet potato fries are awesome 
3b-FgrFl3PaTaodB4WxgSw Urbana Great Chinese I think it was a bit over hyped for me and so I was let down a bit but it s better than anything else I ve had in Chambana 
3bEK8B4XOdKgaR1a7s4hrg Urbana I had to restrain myself from writing this review right after eating here for dinner last night because I was afraid my distended tummy and satisfied tastebuds would ve influenced my review Well This place is great Very good tapas considering this is Urbana Champaign A tad expensive a 76 bill for three but that doesn t stop me from planning to make the rare excursion back Last night my sister mom and I headed down to V Picasso with reservations at 6 PM NO NEED FOR RESERVATIONS at that time my god there were like three tables filled It s a very pretty place all dark and sleek with lighted candles on each table There are two places to sit an actual dining area with plushy red booths and small tables and then a sports bar like area which unfortunately got filled with rowdy drunk college guys as the night went on Our server Audrey was incredibly helpful with the menu and her suggestions for the dates and churros were wonderfully enjoyed We ordered about 8 dishes including spinach croquettes the aforementioned bacon wrapped dates grilled zucchini blackened cod tempura shrimp the specialty for the night shrimp ceviche green string beans lavendar creme brulee and creme filled mini churros The Bad green beans tempura shrimp and shrimp ceviche The green beans were just blah with slivers of almonds A waste of 5 The tempura shrimp was redeemed only because of the delicious red pepper aioli that I swear I would take a bath in it was so good The shrimp ceviche oh the ceviche WHAT THE HECK A weird amalgam of tomatoes and olive and roasted red peppers and jalapenos blegh No Do not recommend The Oh So Good the dates ooh the dates and the spinach croquettes the COD The dates were stuffed with gorgonzola cheese and walnuts and then wrapped in crispy sweet bacon I don t like gorgonzola blue cheese at all but these I devoured these babies I dreamed about those dates last night Really The spinach croquette oozed with cheese and wilted spinach and they changed it a bit so instead of two greasy cakes out came out three crispy morsels Yum And finally blackened cod that was nestled on top of this tomato reduction that was slightly spicy Mmm I was never a fan of blackened fish but it was deliciously crusted in spices I need to go back and try the other tapas 
3cfDIpHMS9UGD4oWWhjFYQ Urbana It was meh the food was too salty and frankly the quality was just not worth the price BYOB is a nice feature which earned them 3 stars instead of 2 but I am guessing they are just waiting to get their liquor license until they start charging exorbitant amounts of money for drinks The price is a sticking point with me because this summer when they were transforming the creperie to this new place I kept hearing how they were going to serve real french food with local ingredients for a more reasonable cost compared to the creperie This has really not panned out I loved the creperie and I thought the food and service matched the prices they charged This place not only has meh food but the service was also not as good first evening chaos maybe I will give them a second chance but it will be with reservation and they will have to excel to make me change my opinion 
3CII2Sc82TCdp6YlXLqeFQ Urbana This used to be a decent Indian restaurant but the last time I went mid summer the food was so greasy it was practically swimming I hope it was a one time thing because I m not inclined to go back especially now that South Indian food is available in Champaign 
3csMOXAC_wj9y3nsFkvJfg Urbana This place seemed to be the fun college hang out bar The place where the frat boys come to hang out and scan the ladies up and down I am not a frat boy I did not come here to hit on ladies I felt old here Though the bartender was nice and offered some suggestions to my friend on where he could meet some ladies to hook up with Mercifully I got to go back to the hotel and get myself to bed 
3D7cpqT0DrpCRAVBq5sp3A Urbana I agree with many of the criticisms listed by other reviewers chips not great some dishes can be bland etc but Fiesta is still my favorite Mexican place in CU I am a vegetarian and I love that they have such a good variety of dishes available without meat I particularly love the chimichangas I also am not a fan of refried beans so I love that Fiesta has the option of black beans for all their dishes It is definitely a comfort food type of restaurant for me cheap and cozy and consistent 
3Dvpmw8FRNu7mAtyShDgcA Urbana My girlfriend and I thought this place was pretty good Seeing that everyone was complaining about the prices and saying that it was overrated we came in with low expectations We only had sushi off the 1 menu and some how we ended up spending over 50 we ordered Nobilo wine and a few appetizers as well We enjoyed the sushi so much that we got a second order of sushi Being from California the prices of the sushi were really no surprise to us The place was pretty clean and the decor was very modern There was seating out side but my girlfriend and I still haven t acclimated to the humidity so we resorted to the indoor conditioning Overall a pretty cool trendy place to get a sushi fix if you need it 
3EoXaS1Lo4PWmFaIaSPHRA Urbana As good as a cheap and greasy breakfast gets Very friendly staff and it really feels like a neighborhood restaurant The breakfast special with coffee is a fantastic deal and the refills keep coming Better food than Merry Ann s in some ways since it is the same type of food but Sam s is only open during the day I ll hopefully get a chance to go back for dinner Overall this is one of the best of breed for greasy delicious breakfast food at low low prices 
3fVqJwreWFYzDz6r_zwEhw Urbana Service 5 stars food 2 stars atmosphere 2 stars Overall 2 5 stars 
3gD1EdYsfWnGq4aC5eVnQw Urbana Good burgers good beer Need more 
3GL6ComZwJR1pfNNtthNQQ Urbana After a disappointing visit to Murphy s on Wednesday evening for a burger I decided to try Legend s on my way out of town late Thursday afternoon I was not disappointed It s a bar bar food beer booths and stools The food is actually quite good This was probably my 3rd or 4th visit and it will now be my go to spot for a burger when I m in Champaign Did I say that the girls here were much much more attractive than over at Murphy s 
3GoqoHTJQIKY8M9aS4P_qg Urbana This is a truck parked at the corner of State and Bradley They usually set up on Fridays starting just before noon Things are little slow in the winter so they are irregular and you just have to see if they are set up I picked up 3 platters of ribs and tips a couple weeks ago for my family and we have been craving them ever since Tender juicy meat that falls off the bone nicely seasoned with sauce on the side The sauce is tomato based like something off the shelf but nothing I m familiar with probably customized a bit It s mild sweet sour tangy but not hot spicy I happen to like it a lot but I know others want more heat The ribs and tips platter is 8 and enough to serve 2 people or 1 very hungry person Comes with bread and chips These ribs are great and I can t stop thinking about getting more Just the smell is awesome In fact these guys have no signage the smell is what sells it I understand they also do catering You can find their number if you do some deep Googling but I ll leave it off here in case they don t want too many random calls 
3hgXz2oaUhxl0Bk7v41nGQ Urbana Pricey but amazing Everything I ve ever had there is top notch And when you re there for brunch you get bottomless MUFFINS And they re amazing muffins Try the pupusa if they still have it on the menu I think the menu changes a lot This place TROUNCES Radio Maria Trounces I can t believe more people don t go here I suppose it may be due to its location which is a bit lonely 
3IVxsS8mgqQyP99NhTP20Q Urbana Just discovered this place in the sport where Zyggyz used to be I ve only been there twice but I ve been impressed both times Being a vegan I ve ordered the Penang Curry w tofu twice and it has been ready in less than 10 minutes every time It is the best Penang curry you can get on Green St as far as I know the only thing missing is that it could use some more veggies like peas and carrots perhaps The spicy scale is between 1 6 and I like spicy food and a 5 works fine for me Big bottles of Sriracha are available if that s your thing For beverages they keep many pitchers of ice water ready for self service and as someone who likes to drink a lot of water with their meals this truly is a nice touch and I wish more places did this I hate having to wait to have someone refill my water and it s a lot easier to have a pitcher at your table if you are among a group or to just be able to stand up and refill your cup on your own As far a service I m going to second what most people have been saying very friendly service and always with a smile As stated previously the dish that I usually get comes out quick but the times I ve been there haven t been very busy Pricing is 8 10 dollars for an entree which might be a bit steep but the portions are adequate and not too filling Overall great Thai food and an excellent lunch option 
3IX2rHHZD0wDlZu6yencXQ Urbana I ve gotten takeout from this place twice now szechuan chicken dinner combo and I must say I have been impressed Not your typical greasy joint although it has the same menu as one the food was cooked to order with good quality chicken and veggies that still had a decent bit of crunch You can sub the egg roll for wonton soup for 85 cents so I did It was yummy and definitely hit the spot The only downside is that the dinner combos are just under 8 bucks which is a bit high but considering the quality I think this will move up in the it s late and I don t have any food at home rotation 
3j4OaMZypWylr7EuJ8IUNw Urbana Good food overall Offers a wide variety of dishes to pick from and all the vegetarian curries taste good I would rate it a zillion times better than the lame Basmati that it used to be earlier However i wouldnt recommend any dish that involves meat chicken lamb I auways end up finishing the whole dish leaving all the meat aside It feels like huge bland chunks of cisco meat that taste no better than rubber had been dumped into the gravy sauce curry that you ordered for and then served Now i stick to vegetarian food when ever i visit this place Note good cust service 
3JWwfZ2Wlz1Nw4qTFdxmiA Urbana I ll start with my negative feedback The service was very slow and the guacamole for appetizer was really bad They used way too much cumin I basically felt like I was eating straight cumin However the sangria is great although quite strong My favorite item was the main course I ordered the scallops and shrimp and thought it was wonderful Perfectly cooked and a lot of great flavors It s a little pricey but the main entree was worth it My husband had the pork tenderloin and thought it was great Skip the guacamole but get the scallops and shrimp dish 
3k0HVp_ntwg6khsLQYquFQ Urbana This is a real gem Probably the most consistently good food in CU Lunch brings nice grilled or deli type sandwiches and there are veg options Dinner is much more interesting with pastas nice fish and meat entree specials and wonderful thin crust pizzas baked in hot ovens Desserts are also very good I am less into fondue exceot for chocolate dessert fondue but this is the place to go for that The ambiance is eclectic and European Families will feel welcome Service can be a little ragged sometimes a student group of 15 or large party will materialize and that can have a rather deleterious effect on service when there are only 2 servers on the floor which is often the case at night Even so I have never had a meal here that was less than very good and many that were excellent 
3L7_YrqUjNI9ZmzD_kV3Cw Urbana I stopped into Esquire Lounge for a couple hours in the evening while waiting for the 7 59 PM Amtrak train back to Chicago This place is right across the street from the station I sat by myself at the bar but there were plenty of others riding solo as well It was THAT kind of place where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows Actually it was much more than that this place seems to have a little bit of everything There are pool tables in the back so you can get that sort of crowd There are larger tables as well so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away There are a good amount of TV s so there were some people watching the evening college football games There are decent sized booths so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops And there s a jukebox so some people are silently rocking out to the classics And perhaps best of all there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem Although he didn t get the words right I gave him an A for effort The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends and even the students are cool with the townies The beer selection was surprisingly good There were a lot of good import options available although I stuck with 2 25 Bud Light drafts Remember I was taking the Amtrak home so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend They have 1 50 PBR drafts too which is what the locals stuck to The food was pretty good as well I had a simple cheeseburger and fries Although not my favorite burger fries combo it was definitely worth the 4 50 I paid The fixin s table they have is nothing more than onions pickles and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces Nothing special there But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself I guess The charm of this place lies in the characters that visit and for that alone I am giving a 5 star rating The cheap food and beer is an added bonus And I almost forgot free peanuts If I return to Champaign any time soon I will definitely be back to this place 
3Lh0k2s5MWemzhIEbXrDuQ Urbana Update 6 20 I thought I d give the impasta another try We had a guest from out of town and thought we d go out rather than spend the night in the kitchen As we went to our seats we noticed an overabundance of drinking and little eating As we scooted into our booth the ladies next to us had to bowls of pasta that for lack of a better description looked dead They were lifeless unappealing and bland So we sat looked over the menu talked about drinks and wine and sat Twenty minutes later we decide to get up even though several people had looked our way No bread no water no hello nothing As we left we were stopped However too little too late We won t be back 
3LlFgFPTqXEHyEQRl951ww Urbana This is a strange place but it has its pleasures It is a cafeteria with extremely plain mid Midwestern offerings My take It is what it is Sometimes I want Midwestern cafeteria comfort food If I do it is OK to come here But if I m honest I can t tell you that this is a good restaurant Hence the two star rating Five funny things about it 1 It s male It is always full of scientists and engineers from the Beckman and CSL Perhaps for that reason it is one of the few establishments that I have entered on a busy day and noticed that of the 20 patrons there are zero women 2 It s university run Since it is run by the university a sign says that you can pay by university purchase order if you want to I have never seen anyone do this 3 The secret garden You can eat in a garden that almost no one uses or knows about to find it you must leave via the West door It is dedicated to women in science 4 The regulars Some people show up at the counter and are served without ordering I asked a staff member about this and she said He s been wanting the mac and cheese for thirteen years 5 The almost free salad I stuff as much into the container as I can and yet after it is weighed I am charged something like 82 cents Dressing extra Although it is a very plain salad bar Most of the food is actually prepared at a food service warehouse somewhere else I asked when I saw tortilla crusted tilapia with long grain wild rice and Kyoto mixed vegetables and the lemon mist cake Once you see the place you ll have a hard time imagining them preparing the tilapia and baking the cake from scratch in the back room and it turns out they don t But both dishes are OK Some of the offerings don t bother Cream based soups are a disgusting glop Some of the naming conventions on the menu make me smile with white sauce Ground beef steak a hamburger patty Some things Heck yeah Jambalaya is good The pot roast is good The hamburger ground beef steak is good I agree with Sarah H the pecan cranberry chicken salad is the big winner Delicious And the staff are delightful They ll loan you money They ll change the dishes around for you They ll sneak you extra food and not charge you for it if you are even a little nice to them You can check the menu online before you go http www beckman illinois edu cafe Note that they run out of their main dishes almost every day usually after about 90 minutes In sum It s a strange little cafeteria But it may be worth visiting at least once just to hang around a weird cafeteria full of weird scientists 
3LRTJwUcNGM2nqq87nl6-w Urbana Luna has excellent food I ve always had a good time every time I ve been Dinner is tapas and various entree s it changes regularly I ve only gone when I expect to spend a good deal of money but I ve always found it delicious I prefer to go for the chef s choice special when I can Less decisions for me and a wide variety of good tapas I ve also been for lunch its less pricy but still delicious I didn t expect to be wowed but I would say their lunch hamburger is the best in town 
3LVfYeBtGdhCuV5hBXOXeg Urbana Siam is my favorite Thai restaurant in Urbana I love their vegetarian options even though I eat meat they make a mean mock duck and they are willing to substitute Seitan into just about any dish I discovered the CRISPY pad thai about a year ago and it s become my favorite dish pad thai that s fried what s not to love The very best part about this restaurant is the fact that they deliver to Urbana residents EAST of Vine st My only complaint about this place is the variable service esp since they don t take reservations I ve been here for both dinner and lunch on several occasions and I have to say depending on which server you get the service is either great or horrendous beware 
3MgkFpVLlSn5DOHAgc2qnA Urbana No thanks Normally I try to go to a place a couple times before writing a review but I don t want to go back I was feeling sick today a wintery day after the students have left for the semester and went looking for comfort food Spicy food seemed like it d be good for congestion and I hadn t tried Torticas Well Torticas was closed so I continued down Green Street to Burrito King I remembered how the reviews were kind of mixed here on Yelp either really high or really low and decided to check it out The good The server was quick and polite and I had horchata right away And a basket of chips which were the best part of the meal The prices are pretty much in line with a campus place maybe a bit cheaper than some The rest I tried to order a torta but I guess they didn t have any I ordered the fajita burrito instead because it s in the name and since I didn t see anything about cheese sauce in the description Comes out with cheese sauce Smells kinda strange almost like plastic The veggies just taste weird and are not crisp at all The meat is chewy and also has that weird taste that reminds me of plastic or chemicals Cheese sauce is really no good salty but not much else in terms of flavor I ate about a third of it trying to make sure I didn t just get a bad bite or something but it tasted strange and unappealing Other than the weird flavor it was pretty bland and no hot sauce on the table at all which is weird for a Mexican restaurant I like Taco Bell sometimes so the food smelling like chemicals isn t always even a deal breaker However I also like Mas Amigos and Taco Loco for their cilantro and onion tacos and spicy flavors and would definitely recommend them or even Taco Bell over Burrito King If you like food like Mas Amigos and do not want the most midwesternized Mexican I ve had then don t go here 
3myJiX_T_C3-1U5YuOHKSQ Urbana Best Authentic Mexican in town hands down I was told this by an authentic Mexican Great Tortas and good drink specials IT is small and pretty popular so be careful peak times 
3Neis7EnShcYP2TYmkTp6A Urbana Food 5 Price 4 Service 3 Atmosphere 2 
3nRP1wjHmJHLf7on9fnNhQ Urbana Had two slices on a Saturday night one sausage and one loaded total was 4 37 with tax Greasy but good taste and crunchy thick crust Good value but not the greatest pizza I ve ever eaten 
3O8Rvulpx-HJlBUaeQCkrw Urbana The restaurant definately looks elegant and is impressive It is clear why it was voted best date place in champaign The menu is interesting expensive and not kid friendly though that appears intentional since they want big checks not big families Veggie option on the menue I had was tofu veggie stirbfry but when it came it had zero tofu strange given the dish was called tofu vegetable stirfry The waiter never checked in on us after our food arrived until we were finished He showed me an updated menu in which there was no tofu in the stir fry too bad I had an old menu he didn t appologize just said that he will make sure to remove the old menus from the stack thanks My daughter liked the dumplings and california roll the edamame are served with sesame oil which is a nice touch The waiter refilled my daughter s lemonade with ice water thanks for that too My son objected when he tried to fill his sprite with water My son and wife liked the steak Dessert was good according to my kids though they didn t finish it so it couldn t have been that good I ve not seen them fail to finish chocolate cake before In all it s over priced decent food with not so great service but excellent ambiance Great for impressing your date but not necessarily great food or service 
3OPH1y8FyocdbG1ZtzTKbA Urbana This is a nice little place Nice staff cool decor I ordered the goat cheese salad spring greens grapes strawberries goat cheese sweet roasted walnuts and fruity vinaigrette and a salmon slider The food was decent Loved the salad but might not get the salmon again as the flavors just didn t work for me However they do substitute boca patties on any of the other sliders for 0 50 extra so I might try that next time What I really like about this place is the strong drinks Two drinks and I had a nice buzz and I m normally not a two drink lady The signature cocktails listed on their menu are pricey but I ordered a Tom Collins not on the menu and it was 3 50 which is pretty good in my book 
3OTMMDTJBfecpM0eV5caPA Urbana This restaurant is WAY OVERPRICED The very small seating area is tacky old and dirty The food is so so at best and the prices are double what they should be Much better choices are available in Champaign try them first 
3qvhnDGt85JxVftM_IktcA Urbana Everyone likes Dos except for me it seems which is a shame since it s cheap near campus and the service is good What can I say The meat quality reminds me of The Jungle the spicy sauces are incredibly bland and everything seems to be soaked in puce colored refried beans The hilarious thing is how every item on the menu is pretty much the same there is very little difference between the tacos the burritos the tamales or anything else Entrees are a lot better than the specials The carne asada tacos while very much not carne asada are OK The ambiance can be summed up with a description of the walls pink and orange sponge paint Dos Reales has a lot of loyal fans but I prefer El Charro or Los Amigos 
3r7VGfVMEO2AJ5kR_c7AbA Urbana Dos Reales is a good place for decent Mexican food The prices are in line with what you d expect They have a wide variety and they are walkable from campus I go regularly for lunch and always get the fajitas or fajita salad There s always plenty of leftovers to take home 
3RTFHgiOvkA1OQeoXmmCQA Urbana I think the other reviews are unfair This place does not pretend to be a high end eatery The food is for college kids who working through a hangover or need to load up for an all nighter That said this place does the job I stopped there after a long car ride from BMI airport I was starving so everything tasted good though also had to remove a good amount of the fries to eat the sandwich like another reviewer It did take a really long time to get the sandwich even though the place only had 1 or 2 other customers I had no problem with the bathrooms but I imagine they are in worse shape on the weekends after everyone s been out to the bar They have rolls of paper towels at the tables instead of typical paper napkins I did have to use a lot of them after unwrapping my sandwich Basically a 2 star type of restaurant sandwich shop fast food but it does a 4 star job of it Good but the food could use a little more engineering to taste better vs just paying for a lot of calories 
3smC78GOGkC6QLCjiLyEMQ Urbana This restaurant was good fine but I wasn t particularly impressed Ordered vegetable vindaloo The place lacks any ambiance though it does have a nice view of Green Street The naan is very good 
3TUvnshTo3jRR-OBTu0Usg Urbana I ll admit that food wise Merry Ann s certainly isn t worthy of four stars but for me it s more about nostalgia We always used to go to the one on Kirby and Neil back during my U of I days but now when my husband and I go to C U we ll occasionally go here for breakfast Their breakfast fare is actually pretty decent and insanely cheap Everything else is pretty much meh Typical diner fare Milkshakes are super yummy though There can often be a wait on the weekends particularly during home football game weekends but it s never very long at all and I suspect there s probably a wait at most other places too There s a parking lot adjacent to the building which is convenient and there s easy access to 74 
3u-_7OCB6AcVTf1qXqkEXA Urbana I agree that being in the puke filled street isn t a plus but it IS still right across from the psych building which I enjoyed Some of their hot sandwiches are very craveable the roast beef au jus one and anything with barbeque sauce always appeals to me and it s a nice change of pace from Subway and sooo much better than Jimmy John s 
3ukZAGk-mlg3HNKj0tWHxQ Urbana When this place started it seemed overpriced but the food was OK especially the empanadas which could be nice Nowadays it is just inedible Low quality ingredients a TON of salt not just salty insanely salty are they actually trying to put people in the hospital A certain empanada with herbs thyme and such had ingredients which were actually evidently expired and tasted so bad that I had to spit my food out Pizza tastes much better even at a place like Papa John not exactly gourmet food Overpriced garbage Never again 
3UpnOtTi5JZhxSoxI4g4rg Urbana Went here looking for pho because I was having a huge craving for it It s good beef pho and for a decent price as far as a big bowl goes it was about 8 or so Other than pho they do have a lot of options and the ordering and serving is pretty easy Be wary of when you order though If you are somewhere in between lunch and dinner time I ve had problems with my friends and I getting a lunch portion when we wanted a dinner portion But the portions are fairly priced so that s a plus But the staff is polite and the food is good and they even have dim sum if you have cravings for it like I do 
3uS7fZyyd2ids3IcJYs-bA Urbana As an Urbana native I grew up going to this place I have always been satisfied and often recommend this to anyone new to the area I really suggest going here and getting any number of the dishes as they are all great The salad bar has a wide range of options which makes it one of the best in town Leave room for dessert The Misprint is definitely worth it 
3vBV0zNu76ZFbOSIPnSA3Q Urbana Lots of comfort food at this local favorite The food unfortunately is not as good as it used to be and they crowd a few too many tables in the dining room It s almost a three star but since they ve taken such good care of me all these years and the service is good it s still a winner in my book Shakes burgers and sandwiches and a nice little salad bar The breakfast however is the reason to come It used to be the Courier newspaper so there are historic artifacts from the old days 
3xGGBSyKbbvaVrs0-9Bo3Q Urbana I almost didn t want to write this review because it seems to be a great hidden gem for Mexican food in CU Every time I go there we are seated promptly and it s never overcrowded which is something I like about the place if you ve ever been to Dos Reales on a Friday night you know what I mean Lately i ve noticed it s popularity increasing significantly because there has been a lot more people in there with each trip I make This leads me to believe that the great food service and drinks are getting noticed and I m really happy about that I really want this place to do well because it actually is really good I ve been to Dos Reales El Torro Mas Amigos and La Fiesta and this beats them all Every time I go I order something different and have always been satisfied The portions are good too The chips and salsa are delicious and everyone at the table gets their own little salsa dish which I love The menu has a lot of dishes that you don t usually see which is fun if you ve gotten too familiar with the menus of other places in the area And the prices are pretty much the same if not slightly cheaper than other Mexican Restaurants And if you love Margaritas then you ll love this place They are strong tasty and thick I would recommend asking for 2 straws They are very dense and seem to last forever Also the service here is top notch The wait staff is always courteous polite and very helpful And quick I ve never had to wait very long for a waiter or my food That may change as this place gets more popular but I can t say that I would mind anyway Five stars My number one choice for Mexican 
3Y2pexMFqNLADqWWolgmoQ Urbana I ve eaten here three times over the past 5 years and I ve been disappointed each time Sometimes it s because they mess up my orders sometimes it s because the food is just underwhelming or simply not fresh I know people who like this place a lot so perhaps I am just unlucky 
3yqg2Ib8vi3QjbVa8lZuGw Urbana The food was good not great The portion size was a bit too small for the price Ive had frozen Indian food that is comparable to what I had at Bombay I mean the experience was enjoyable minus the cramped table but I really don t think it s all that great 
3YZbyoRf5LfUn2yLhWQm4Q Urbana We went to get lunch here on a Saturday afternoon Waited for about 15 20 minutes for a table VERY cramped waiting area Menu had a lot of options I went with the Monkey Stuff sandwich this sweet delectable sandwich of tasty sugary goodness This sandwich would have been way better had the bread been toasted By the end I just felt like I was eating a mush of sugar To counteract this sugar I also ordered from the salad bar I liked the layout of the Salad Bar you pay 0 38 per oz of salad you get so I had a filling salad to go with my sweet sandwich for only 2 50 Not a very diverse salad bar but I was fairly pleased The other members of my party enjoyed their meal just fine but we didn t feel this was anything special The decor of the restaurant is very vintage so it s kind of dark and has a different feel to it After reading the reviews I m bummed I didn t order a milkshake I don t know that we d necessarily make a special trip to come back here 
3zf1Ft1l4wbcaLHEKXjrcQ Urbana Another time I may have given this restaurant 4 stars because in the past we haven t had the best service However my husband and I went here last night for our anniversary and everything was perfect Even though we have had some issues with the service in the past my family pre husband has been coming here for as long as I can remember probably over 10 years The food is so good there is really nothing the servers could do to keep us from coming back My favorite meal in the world is the cheese fondue sometimes with the tomato puree one of the yummy pizzas preferably with brie followed by their chocolate fondue I think I have strayed from that formula once I can t remember what I ordered I didn t think it was possible but last night all three of those items were better than ever We had the cheese fondue with the tomato puree this time as well as the pesto portobello mushrooms artichoke hearts and brie pizza it was amazing The chocolate fondue came with more fruits than I remember in the past red and green apples pears strawberries and some yummy little cake pieces The best meal I had all year The service was excellent 
3_i4Wn_TEP2ZzQtMrzI6iw Urbana This was some excellent Bolgogi The restaurant is small and pretty quiet I take the silence to mean that everyone is eating and enjoying their food thoroughly The BBQ was a little bit pricey at 10 99 but it is very filling and worth that amount 
4-70ebAW_Q1lDg9sNAc_dA Urbana This is a Taco Bell alright I used to eat here every Sunday for a while when I lived in the dorms and the kitchen was closed My standards were not terribly high but I was never disappointed with the soft tacos or nachos I ve been back a few times lately If you grew up eating Taco Bell sometimes the craving comes back On this location The side door area kind of smells like urine but it is right next to the bathroom I ve never used the drive through so I can t comment Going in the middle of the day on the weekend I have never had a problem The food is Taco Bell you know what you are getting I am partial to the beefy crunch burrito right now It s a burrito With spicy Fritos on it There are days when that s what you want One time I had a very disorganized order and the lady working the register organized it into value meals to save me some money I really appreciated that I usually get my food to go Last time they forgot one of the tacos but when I mentioned it they immediately made it up for me Then I took 12 Fire sauce packets as usual and left to enjoy it 
40sheuPG_BVL6xnIgrFSGw Urbana Excellent for the middle of the corn fields I wish this was around back in the day Their sauces are rich and flavorful 
41O_EGIzPhuz9x-UVWv3bg Urbana I was completely disappointed with my last visit to Casablanca As soon as my group walked in we were met by a waitress that did not smile or greet us but merely slapped a few menus on the table and walked away She proceeded to be rude and inattentive for the entire dinner spending more time on her cellphone then serving us She even messed up on our check twice and they were not split checks either In addition to this I thought the food was average at best The chicken tikka masala was a bit sour and the portions could have been bigger The only reason I am giving them two stars instead of one is because my previous experience with them was not nearly as bad 
42EmKkeXRynib26wINVPZw Urbana Amongst the many other campus bars Legends is truly a find a not so well hidden diamond in the rough The drink prices are reasonable for campus and amazing when compared to Chicago The food here appears to be your regular run of the mill bar grub but alas there is something special about those loaded fries Their half off appetizer deal on Fridays is pretty sweet too But my all time favorite is the Legends Ranch Chicken served only on Mondays I d call in sick for that Don t miss out on their Long Islands 5 on Mondays they re seemingly innocent which makes them all the more lethal 
42kDtZKjPVm5sK_oAZ4tEw Urbana I love the lunch portion here because it s not too big for me My favorite lunch specials are Crispy Tofu and Broccoli Chicken As for dinner I love Basil Chicken I wish it came in the lunch portion too The only concerns I have at this restaurant are that tables are often dirty and the restaurant setting doesn t creat a relaxing dinning ambiance Will definitely go back 
439tQyJQZBF8uecJNvwMMQ Urbana Man I was wary about this place because it looks like every other Chinese food place ever and I don t like most takeout restaurants But it s really really good Sure it s not the swankiest of places but if that bothers you so much take your food to go First of all the guy running the place is so cool I told him I wasn t feeling well and wanted some soup He was like I have JUST the thing Not long after I picked up a huge bowl of soup with big ol chunks of fish cakes squid and shrimp It was a hot and sour seafood soup with noodles and it was nice and spicy At most places when they talk about spicy food it s not really that hot Not so at Cravings I am used to eating spicy food and I was wiping my nose Gross I know Anyway the ingredients taste fresh and the portions are huge They provide water and tea for free which is great when it s cold outside And they give great takeout containers for soups I know it s the little things I ll definitely be back to try more on the extensive menu Hm I wonder if they deliver 
43tErgRSClWiS9AcQch1Iw Urbana I miss you Chopstix Since I moved across the country in July I think about your General Tso s tofu on a weekly basis at least Maybe one day I will return and smuggle some onto the plane back Much love 
44gR0KJKI2-F3brHs7x_Fg Urbana Sushi Ichiban has delicious fresh sushi for an unbeatable price I always get one of the 2 or 3 roll sushi specials that come with an egg roll which are 7 for 2 rolls or 9 for 3 rolls for lunch and then 1 more at dinner time They have the popular sushi rolls you would get in your average Japanese restaurant but a few special rolls as well It has a sort of fast food feel to it because you order at the counter but the taste is better than any of the other sit down sushi restaurants on campus I get the take out quite often and they are VERY quick and always do a good job of packing enough condiments I will definitely be eating here several times a week during the school semester it has become one of my favorite campus restaurants since it s opening 
44wxgVWAqfl-SHOiKsRIHw Urbana 5 no onions no tomatoes extra sauce I had been dreaming about saying that for years In college I used to come here a couple times a week either to get their subs or their day old bread a loaf for 50c But after I left college I stopped living in places that had a Jimmy Johns All I was left with was the hope that one day I d be able to walk into a Jimmy Johns and say that phrase for my order On a recent trip back to my old alma matter I got that exact chance I walked in the door and before I even got to the register I was asked what I wanted by the person making sandwiches She immediately got to work and by the time I had paid a freshly made sandwich was sitting wrapped next to the register How awesome is that 
45xdCq5n9xD-YsBxTgMPrQ Urbana Read some of these reviews and it seems people really have it out for this place I experienced an incredible dinner with engaging and knowledgeable staff at a great price and even had some great jazz playing while we ate Talked to the table next to us who were experiencing the same thing who then recommended brunch can t wait to try it later today 
48HhiBjiP_3AvUdPTbtfZQ Urbana Generally I m a fan of cheap greasy diner food This place however is just bad It s overpriced for what you get and the service is awful The diner itself could use a little work as well Our table was sticky and dirty My friend and I stopped here before I moved to Champaign while I was in town looking at some apartments My friend ordered the grilled cheese with fries and I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries Her grilled cheese was basically a piece of American cheese on white bread That s it I ve made better grilled cheese at home using the same ingredients There wasn t really much to my chicken sandwich either Overall nothing special I don t understand the rave reviews of this place at all Maybe the breakfast is better Too bad I won t be returning Also I noticed a sign that said NO STUDYING I guess they want you to just eat your crappy food and GET OUT The location in downtown Champaign seems nicer but I haven t been in because of the horrible experience I had at the other location Might give it a try to see if it s any better 
4AiKkv-nznjIcVJv1VBSHw Urbana Thumbs up for the Best Chinese food ever No I am not exaggerating Until I came across Golden Harbor my Chinese food options were just limited to carry out places where I used to more often than not get the Vegetarian Fried Rice and the Vegetarian Spring Rolls but Golden Harbor to me redefined the concept of Chinese Food They have an elaborate menu for Vegetarians which is very unlikely for a Chinese Restaurant and note that none of these Vegetarian dishes contain duck sauce or oyster sauce like most of the other Chinese places The owner is an extremely friendly person who greets you with a smile and explains to you the menu in detail if you have any questions When it comes to orders this restaurant works differently You have plenty of tables to sit and dine but the waiters don t come to take your order As soon as you enter you have a table filled with menus both the American version and the Chinese version a small book and some pens for you to write the order and mark it and give it to the owner at the billing counter The lady then gives you a token for you to take and place it on the table you sit Then the waiters come and deliver the food to your table My personal favorites at this restaurant are Vegetable steamed dumplings and Spicy Hunan Vegetables 
4BN40JK7lJJ-35pzMmKp3A Urbana So we ve started coming back here over and over mostly for dessert but for the occasional breakfast I m glad to say that I ve tried all of their crepes by now and the Orange Suzette is still my favorite You definitely have to bring out the pocketbook but the food is quality Enjoy 
4Cr6u-pZDGWveDvOeLvZXQ Urbana I really do dislike writing bad reviews for anything but I feel this experience merits a warning I just moved here from south Texas was really craving Mexican food and felt too lazy to go sit in a restaurant so delivery it was I ordered a cheese quesadilla with onion and tomato for a sad attempt at pico de gallo and chips and salsa The quesadilla was incredibly greasy the tomato chunks were quite large and the onion was far too overpowering for my taste The chips and salsa were another matter The chips were edible but they weren t my favorite And warning with the salsa if you order the spicy salsa expect green salsa I m used to red so the possibility of green didn t even cross my mind I m not a fan of green salsa so my dislike is likely an artifact of my dislike of green salsa in general not this specific salsa Plus side The food was delivered about half an hour earlier than estimated Looking at the rest of the reviews it doesn t appear that Cactus Grill is ALWAYS bad so maybe mine was just a bad experience but still TL DR greasy quesadilla hard chips green salsa searching for another Mexican restaurant 
4CzNJgubCoGrxLm0fhe_PA Urbana Meh I came in around 19 00 and the buffet was mostly dried up Some bins didn t have anything left but the hostess owner assured me she would make more of whatever I wanted Soups egg drop hot and sour were alright but I think I ll pass on this place next time even though it was super cheap 
4DaTj95b-9se8osukJ8OVA Urbana This is the REAL DEAL 
4DV7tHLKv5cQAWBxV2O1jw Urbana I brought my husband to Meatheads for lunch on his birthday He was super excited so we splurged He ordered a Build Your own Burger half pound burger which is actually 3 small patties stacked and a fried egg on top w swiss cheese He loved it We had the Chili Cheese Fries and they were delicious I think the previous reveiwers who had Take Out maybe didn t get the full experience like you do with dining in because I would rank the Chili Cheese Fries at top of my list I had the Texas Ranch burger and enjoyed every bite We also had a Mocha Shake which was very rich and delicious though my husband thought is was very coffee flavored um that s the point I thought but was happy to drink more of his share Oh and I love the fancy soda dispensers they are the electric ones where you can choose a flavor to go with your soda choice totally fun 
4eL5wClG2w1mivBumC08Ew Urbana So mediocre I cannot believe people are seriously reviewing it with better than 3 stars It isn t cheap It doesn t taste great These reviewers must be the same people that give Chipotle 5 stars Don t go here eat frozen pizza instead 
4EmXA_YGzYQOWL21BNDQdg Urbana It s ALL about the peanut butter and chocolate milkshake I usually get the reuben sandwich or an omelet but it s really the milkshake that keeps me coming back 
4ErN50JI4lDkmkwOduPZUg Urbana As far as the authenticity of the food by far the best anywhere in Champaign Urbana wife and I ordered baby squid in basil sauce and the peking pork the squid was cooked perfectly and spiced perfectly The peking pork was fried to perfection and the sauce was very tasty They have updated their menus so that the good stuff can be read in English now Their dim sum is pretty standard items but the only real place to go in Champaign myself I would probably wait till I get back to Chicago for that The down side of this place is their are two waitress that also work in the kitchen everything is self serve the tea drinks even your utensils So do not come here expecting great service but all in all the most authentic chinese restaurant in Champaign 
4FlmHz19eM6fnlsUeTB_5A Urbana I think people like this place based on the fact that it s a trendy little place in Champaign and they probably feel cool going there The decor reminds me of IKEA with fish tanks and the food and drinks are decent nothing spectacular I do like the fact that it s downtown and has an outside patio which is awesome in the summer All in all not a bad place just not worth all the hype 
4gCjQXxxwp9Dm2KkmZ7P5A Urbana I m a little bias about this place since my Great Grandfather and Great Great Grandfather owned this place when it was a newspaper and printing business The building has a lot of nostalgia for me So the atmosphere is awesome especially knowing relatives had spent so much time in it and keeps its old charm The restaurant owners have done a nice job keeping the historic feel while not going tacky We were there for breakfast I ve heard lunch and dinner are so so Our breakfasts were all very good fresh tasty and good portions Nothing that makes you call it the best you ever had but great basic food nonetheless I ll go back for breakfast at the Courier next time I m in town Have to say the service was outstanding super friendly fast unobtrusive Go give the Courier a try and say hi to the ghosts for me 
4gShsW48YvAyQF7A_HJovw Urbana The lunch special actually runs all day long which is fantastic For two rolls plus miso and a ginger salad 10 95 cannot be beat However the rolls at full price I m not sure when you would get charged that wouldn t at all be worth it They are of decent quality but happen to be very small Lastly the impression that I ll have on my mind when considering this place in the future will be of the service Our waitress did not visit our table at all after serving our meal which means drinks weren t refilled plates weren t cleared and the check was not brought to us She even stood over us as we filled out the tip on our bill Go for the lunch special and expect nothing more 
4HjQwIDVc1PGvvP5MIGN9g Urbana Gumby s has pizza No one cares you come for the stix and that s all that matters After all these years a u of i stop is not complete without heading down to pokey sticks This delectable cheesy bread goodness is beyond itself With the tangy ranch dressing and the sweetness of marina this place is carb bliss It travels pretty well if you pop it in your truck so you can share it with your Chi town loved ones However under no circumstances should it be in the main part of the car or the smell of garlic and cheese will be nauseating 
4HLG1HmNR03pLcG2f1CnQw Urbana It s funny how the nice new couple at church kept asking me how school was whenever they d see my ILLINOIS sweatshirt after church I just thought they were very friendly and brushed it off After all we re in the North Shore after all Turned out they own this place and drive up every Sunday for church Insane people I used to come here during high school trips on weekends to see the boyfriend and now more often that I m visiting the school again so I can finish up a lousy bachelor s Still the same food still the same portions and the homey feeling of an unpretentious restaurant I love the duk gook I ll never eat it at home but when they see me in the restaurant it s always a pat on the head and a How s school I do love to support local business but this is getting really close to home Combos are a good idea for newbies to the Korean food world but kalbi and bulgogi are awesome choices if you re diving headfirst by yourself Remember though they re closed on Sundays That s how we Koreans roll 
4hv7sqoPJuXjZqq7GRZiYQ Urbana My idyllic memories of Boltini are almost assuredly the product of imperfect memory and undiscerning taste reader beware But even the particulars I can recall still sound objectively wonderful Metal baby feet for door handles internally lit glass panes that trap splays of branches and project Tim Burtonesque shadows on the walls above the intimate circular booths and swank cushions in the recessed lounge Bells on tap a full array of top shelf liquors not normally a special attraction but it s in Central Illinois after all and a martini list I used to adore This is really where the lovely memory gets shaky I was horribly fond of the Hollywood Absolute Mandarin Chambord and orange juice which now just sounds heinously sweet and I seem to remember them costing far more than I ever wanted to pay for a drink in Champaign It makes me wonder if perhaps I would be disappointed were I to return but I suspect that Boltini is still the only bar in Champaign that manages to be sort of hip almost pulls off posh even seems legitimately urbane And once in a while in a college town that s absolutely worth the slightly higher prices Light appetizers are available until 10pm and the menu aspires to a cheese plate and pesto bruschetta sort of class but I never got there early enough to judge the execution Oh and don t miss the doll s head in the banister and it suddenly occurs to me that maybe I m just squicky about the dismembered infant parts Regardless four stars 
4KQWCANcqvpkmAyli-RuyA Urbana I used to like this bar when I was in college on occasion I definitely had some good times there and the outdoor area was nice I haven t had their food so I can t speak for that but I just remember it being sort of average overall 
4Mb8lx33kpL1349P6X5C3w Urbana What a total total let down Now I am ONLY talking about sushi I have not tried their other food Let me begin by saying I just moved here from Los Angeles where sushi is fresh and every bite is like heaven I cant blame Illinois for being to far away from fresh fish but I just hoped that this would be the place because everyone said this is the best sushi in town Now I was HOPING HOPING HOPING they were right because we tried every other sushi place and I was seriously desgusted The rolls here came out looking very very pretty The service is great too and I love the place as far as decor But the sushi was just not good It may have been the best of the worst but come on For the price you pay for each roll I expect more then this The sushi was so fishy tasting I bit into one of the spicy tuna rolls and spit it out in my napkin after I gagged It was awful My husband who can normally at least finish the plates so we dont waste couldnt finish either I have to say I feel sorry for the people here because Sushi is actually amazing But you wont find it anywhere around here 
4mmRVfb9BwDN3mAEWQZOXA Urbana I had heard about Papa Del s and was excited to try it after reading the reviews I ordered a pepperoni sausage and mushroom my go to pizza The parking was difficult to find because it s on the side of the building Up the stairs is where you pay and when I got up there the service was not very friendly After paying and walking to my car I noticed that the grease from the pizza was ooozing out of the box and dripped onto my jeans I was fairly pissed about that not only did it stain my jeans but I knew I ordered a greasy pizza Deep dish pizza was pretty good but there was soo much sauce and not enough cheese I usually enjoy pizza equally if not more on the second day of eating it and this pizza was not very good on day two Overall I m not sure if I would go back but I m glad that I tried it I think there are better pizzas around town 
4mULu1ObZju34bwWMDbTcw Urbana If you like really dry overcooked ribs and tips come to this place We came with a big group and it was already packed so we decided to do carryout It turned out to be 30 mins of waiting in a small cramped restaurant with people constantly walking by forcing you to move when our food finally came There was also a guy walking out telling me not worth the wait I didn t think too much of it because the place looked promising We went back to eat it and took about 10 mins figuring out who ordered what They place all of our food together in 3 bags which was fine but they didn t labeled anything We ordered the combo which included pulled pork slab of ribs and rib tips I only tried the ribs and tips but they were really dry and the sauce didn t make it any better I have tried many great ribs but this one definitely don t cut it As busy as it gets here the guy was right definitely not worth the wait 
4m_7TUprUbVLwPoWBeP90g Urbana Best Chicago style pizza in town If you are in town you should go here The pizza is just amazing 
4Nbk1pgc1zTEnzAH_vr0hw Urbana We have been to Destihl several times I ve heard beer enthusiasts say that their brewery and beers aren t that great but the food more than makes up for it Everything I ve ordered has been great and the service is spot on I ve gone with just my husband larger groups of adults and have also gone with the kids It s been smooth sailing no matter the size or composition of the group Their kids menu is broader than most which is nice The regular menu offers unique dishes that have always enjoyed I would definitely recommend it 
4nhs1wVtfhZxs9nQvYBY2g Urbana In terms of campus bars this is definitely my favorite bar to go to especially now that I ve been out of college for a few years Is it the best bar in Champaign Urbana No probably not but if you re in the area this is your spot It s super low key super pubby feeling and usually has a nice mix of hipsters sports fanatics and average joes The beers on tap are always good and remain pretty simple They always have specials too which is nice I miss this place 
4QQF0sRpugfwqQNhM1Moxg Urbana This place wants to be better than it actually is The ambiance is really quite nice They did a great job restoring the building and the grounds It is beautiful and it was also the first smoke free restaurant in town I very much appreciated that at the time The food wants to be outstanding but it is only very good For as much as this place costs I want it to be better More innovative more spectacular The wait staff is mostly very young and not quite experienced enough to pull off the fine dining experience One time one of them addressed my dining companion as dude He took offense and rightly so We are not your surfin buddies we are your customers That said this is a great place for a big celebratory dinner with your whole family It s a beautiful setting the wine and beer lists are good and your grandmother will be able to find something she wants to eat So will your vegetarian cousin and her picky five year old and so will you 
4QuzYbBBcrPKazLe4VTSiw Urbana I love the idea pizza and empanadas two of the best foods ever However the empanadas weren t so good In one word soggy I like my empanadas freshly fried little bundles of goodness wrapped in a crispy shell of deliciousness I should have known when the nadas were sitting in a display case under a heat lamp You get 2 instead of 1 because the guys working there were nice If I get hungry I might try the pizza and reevaluate 
4QwppBPZr2ljczitGw2SmQ Urbana The falafel shawarma and kefta are the classic fast food staples of Mediterranean cuisine and Jack s has nailed it The hummus and Jerusalem salad have just the right amount of tahini and the food is cooked to order No dry or overcooked falafel This spot is the jammy jam for this kinda food in Champaign Don t plan on being impressed by the decor in the place though there is none That doesn t bother me at all Jack s feels more like my friend s house and their parents keep offering me more food Eat EAT Try this You ll love it You want some more baklava Here take three pieces and I like that My only complaint I wish they were open late 
4RiiLcz-we2Y9B_WqSVBFQ Urbana I lived in Champaign for about 8 years and just moved back to Chicago this summer I miss El Toro more than words can describe Outstanding and fast service great prices and delicious food My husband and I loved El Toro so much we had our rehearsal dinner there and our priest mentioned El Toro in our wedding homily I miss you Toro 
4RMxrTpfUjd52YqAhpDGow Urbana Visited here for the first time a few days ago I ve been to Qdoba many times over the years but had always avoided Chipotle due to the much longer waits I generally avoid campus eateries when students are here but since it was much less crowded on campus a friend of mine and I decided to take advantage I wanted to get a chicken burrito as did my friend but we were told it would be at least an additional 5 minute wait so my friend chose steak and I decided to try the carnitas I was expecting something very flavorful but I felt it was rather bland I chose black beans medium salsa wish I had gone with hot now because medium had no heat or taste at all and cheese Perhaps it would have been better with chicken but I would have taken a steak queso burrito from Qdoba any day I will probably give it another chance if I have the urge to go on campus but the hype I had heard before going outweighed my actual experience Extremely loud but you kinda expect that on campus 
4s62iUV-uSIZszg7QadGIg Urbana Went by after work which isn t that late around 5pm to pick up some bagels for breakfast and discovered that this location closes at 3pm I could have sworn that I ve had dinner at Panera before so it must be a quirk of this particular one 
4Sbc1Ysc2ZLRSEeBYgcBzw Urbana Well at least it s cheap Hot Wok serves a purpose It makes food court Chinese seem gourmet by comparison Best part You don t need to get out of your car 
4sQYYZehT9UjdaiD5ZUUTw Urbana Wow Pickles is great Once a year when you are tired of getting your grad student snobbery on at koFusion or where ever and need a near lethal injection of kitsch When I went it was still decorated for christmas and they had metallic green pickle ornaments hanging on fake trees and drawings of pickles trimming a christmas tree on the specials white board And it is not ironic These people are serious My burger was palatable my fries were much better and they did have heineken Also a side of the day Today it was macaroni salad Wow Unfortunate note though all our entrees WERE served with pickles they were terrible 
4UmpSlER9N0ni7ULb-fM3g Urbana The atmosphere is better than the food Not remarkable Italian food but good enough Our table had the chicken galena the gnocchi spaghetti alla dom lasagne and the sea bass No one complained and no one exclaimed Standard and the atmosphere makes it good for the price Out waitress Katrina was fantastic She said it was her first night serving which usually makes me worry a touch but she did a wonderful job She was careful with our orders and got everything right made sure to check back with us on anything that was iffy We got very good service at the bar during our 1 hour wait Asked for wine recs and the bartender said to be honest I m a whiskey and bourbon guy and I really appreciated the honesty Most bartenders would ve blindly recommended something based on nothing 
4UOeiba_V7W4OuH2BhPHXg Urbana French toast is amazing We were told it s better and thicker when Sam is working but it was still extra yummy Imagine if a pancake mated with french toast and danced in cinnamon yeah that good Bacon was fresh and the right balance of crispy without being overdone Scrambled eggs were made of real eggs and the hashbrowns American fries had a buttery taste we loved Unpretentious hole in the wall that is worth the drive Cash only and bring change for the parking meters 
4wpghTvo4eklyGW_g3riUQ Urbana I ve eaten Indian all over the state and this place remains my favorite The portions are generous the prices are low and the food is vibrantly flavorful the way Indian should be I actually worked here for a summer and I can honestly say I ve never eaten better in my life All day and all night my stomach was a bubbling cauldron of curry Try the vegetable vindaloo I put it on the menu 
4wx1mBFrjbTPbhDoNqYKkg Urbana This place is pretty awesome The ambience is cute the service is friendly and incredibly fast and the food is good and really affordable I ve never been dissapointed by anything I ve ever ordered here I have no idea what real Mexican food tastes like having been born and raised here in the midwest but from what I ve had of Mexican food this is one of the places I like best 
4xbeETQDeAFpJbtVGhKjpw Urbana Food 3 Price 4 Atmosphere 3 Service 3 
4YamrXCXdVzkHuxEeC01WA Urbana This place has good sushi I ve had better but they have a great lunch special for 10 you get a special roll Japanese Lasagna was good and a regular roll california roll tuna roll ect This lunch special is ironically available for dinner as well for the same price and the special is accompanied by a small salad which is topped with a sour dressing salad wasn t very good and a small bowl of miso soup soup was decent However the lunch special rolls seem to be slightly smaller but they are garnished nicely and the plates are beautifully decorated The service was good they promptly served us and were friendly The place isn t very decorated so I wouldn t recommend this place for any romantic outing of importance anniversaries birthdays ect but is a good place for lunch 
4ZS13hF_Yv1UX6mN7fHjDA Urbana so greasy it burned the fuck down i am sure each gyro and basket of fries i ate there each knocked 6 months off of my lifespan All I can say is I m still alive so I obviously didn t eat there enough 
4ZtpwTPyZvwCBONg0n0i-g Urbana That giant menu on the wall that you can t read because it s in Chinese just close your eyes and pick something Secret menus always guarantee great food Maybe you re not that adventurous It s ok I don t judge Just make sure you go with an experienced Golden Harbor er or someone that can read Chinese because not everything on their giant menu is listed on the English one Whatever you choose to devour and you will cause this place is DIVINE make sure you don t skip the crispy tofu 10 It is THE best in the world yes capital T H E BEST Not a fan of tofu Eh your loss Try not to crave this place on a Monday I know I know it s hard but don t do it You ll pull up and have your heart broken to see that it s closed on Mondays They also close from 3 4 30pm everyday everyone needs a lunch break y know So plan accordingly UGH SO GOOD 
4_aT1RB1nvjrOp_KOxw7yg Urbana 4 5 5 Great restaurant all around Friendly helpful waitstaff Diverse and large menu of appetizers meat veggies seafood drinks desserts everything I tried the shrimp ceviche awesome summer dish swordfish delicious yet small for a swordfish steak fish and chips delicious as well and a cherry heffeweizen and a Hawaiian fruit beer to drink Everything was awesome tasty and presented well Can t wait to go back 
4_eF9LC8WQrN9usHSR4dGA Urbana A friend of mine was promoting a show here last night necessitating a road trip down Out of all the places we got during the grand Annoyingly Large College Town tour I liked the Cowboy Monkey the best I won t comment on the music of the groups except to say that one of them made me want to literally tear my eyeballs out Just really fucking atrocious and embarrassing However I give the place credit for booking kind of weird stuff considering the glossy feeling look of the place I m pretty glad I don t know the one guy s name because come on I know I like bad music but you don t just play other people s records occasionally sing and occasionally add a guitar line You lose buddy 2 PBR bottles all night long Attentive and nice barkeeps Mix of 40somethings and college kids Decent sound Class organization all around 
4_nLOrIYyWJtl5E_SxVAxg Urbana I went to Doodles with a group of friends yesterday for lunch As I write this I can t decide whether to give it three or four stars I m torn I feel like maybe I can t fairly judge Doodles because most restaurants on campus aren t at their peak during spring break However it s the only time I ever go to campus because of the difficulty of navigating campus while classes are in session Hence my indecision Here s why it deserves four stars It s cheap The service was quick and friendly Doodles does ramen and little else I hear they have spam musubis but there were none to be found yesterday probably due to spring break I d almost definitely give Doodles 4 stars nay 5 if they had good spam musubis Sigh I liked the ingredient list It s a good idea The portions were generous Boyfriend bought lunch and 2 pretty loaded doodles he had Aloha I had sesame doodle with spam egg and fried tofu plus a soda was 8 75 Hawaii native boyfriend was very pleased with the Aloha doodle which had fish cake seaweed and other things I don t eat plus spam Spam would ve been better crispy and fried but I always feel that way Here s why I want to give it three stars It s ramen Sure there are fancy toppings but it s just Maruchen Top Ramen A freeze dried block of noodles So it s cheap but not that cheap if you consider what goes in it I could ve duplicated my doodle at home for less than two dollars but paid 1 75 for the sesame base plus 1 00 for spam and 50 each for the hard boiled egg and fried tofu The decor is cute and kind of trendy but there isn t a lot of seating Our group of 7 had to find somewhere else to eat It also took a while for all of us to be served though the guy working the proprietor I believe was totally nice and engaging See I m not being fair and I know it because it s meant to be food to take and go not a place for a leisurely group lunch Still my gut feeling about my Doodles experience is just A OK All in all I m glad I went to Doodles once I doubt I ll be back If I were in college I d really like Doodles I bet I d probably eat there regularly It s fast cheap customizable what more could you want But anyone with a regular income or a kitchen would be best served to make your own ramen and add ingredients at home 
4_zRtp1-__w6JU-4vbq6Bg Urbana I m going to start out my review by saying this is my favorite place to get Sunday brunch in Champaign I almost took off a star for reasons I will explain momentarily but don t go thinking oh only 4 stars I can get this brunch elsewhere in town You can t It s also cheaper and better to go here than Jim Gould or Radio Maria the other Sunday Brunch games in town I m also hesitant to write a super glowing review because if suddenly everyone started to go there and I had a super long wait I would cry The service used to be ridiculously bad as previous reviews have stated but obviously somebody had a word with somebody because the last several times I have been there this is no longer the case The omelets are delicious I don t like omelets because they re hard and brown on the outside but not so at Luna Soft oozy egg I m sure some people would say they re not cooked enough but those people are just so wrong And the choices of omelet are delicious as are the roasted potatoes and petite salad that comes with the omelet I get muesli every time I go because I m like that and it s Really Good but if I weren t on a quasi diet I d get beignets instead Admittedly I tend to be more pro coffee than pro cocktail in the AM but if you re the mimosa bloody mary type they ve certainly got them I don t know where they get it but the coffee is good too It s not perfect The cinnamon rolls were only ok I ve had avocado issues One time the kitchen forgot to put it in the omelet and the next time they didn t have avocado and the waiter didn t tell me my omelet was coming out sans avocado A Chicago reviewer would say there are kinks I must say however it s delicious and you should totally go 
5-ius0XzN8vO7o3zwxSB5Q Urbana Went Thursday night for a late dinner with my husband This was my first trip to escobar but middle son who had been there before refused to go because he claimed the atmosphere was too uninviting This was unusual for him to refuse to go out because he is a serious boy about town and never misses an opportunity to experience anything OK i m sorry to say the aesthetic sensibilities of my 12 year old are a bit more fine tuned than whoever designed the interior of this restaurant It s all hard surfaces so the feel is very cold and extremely loud I asked my husband twice throughout the meal if he would be mad at me if I asked the people at the table next to us to stop laughing in such an annoying pitch Since he reminded me that i am not Larry David and nobody would find it funny i refrained onto the food we had a spinach salad with mangos shrimp cucumbers and red onions in a citrusy dressing this was good definitely fresh then we had a grouper over rice with veggies eh it was ok very large portions as in enough to feed 2 hungry adults which worked well since we shared everything the fish was very fresh though so i give it 4 stars for that then we ordered coffee and bananas flambe the coffee had to be sent back because it was so weak and instead we ordered espressos i rarely ever send anything back probably because i hate wasting anything but this was reeeeeeeeeeeeeally bad coffee Our waitress even agreed that she has to doctor her coffee when she drinks it here due to the weakness But the bananas and the caramel sauce now that is worth 4 stars Would i go back No Should you try it Yes There seemed to be a lot of people there having a good time laughing loudly 
5-sDKaXxUhyY49zARj-jpw Urbana Loved the style and ambiance of the place Very laid back but classy as well The waiter was so nice and answered any and all questions I had about the very very large liquor menu My husband and I got the 1 2 salad 1 2 soup option which is a very nice price The vegetable soup was very hardy and our salads were delicious Would definitely go back if I lived nearby 
51yGRqu42_P_JIXcRslH9A Urbana Great pasta dishes here The sandwiches are also good Their make your own options are nice everyone can find something they like The atmosphere is nice I prefer to eat upstairs as there is more room and I have never had a problem with the people who work there The price is rather high though 6 8 for a pasta dish most of which is the pasta itself Give me a break 
52O5yB6JxzqxssUy7qEtrA Urbana This was one of my favorite Chinese places in C U and it s just a tiny place with a few tables Not expensive at all I think there was a Chinese grandmother in the kitchen lovingly preparing meals to be served but even if not that s how I felt after eating here Good lo mein and more recently they ve added Thai entrees Most dishes are vegetarian 
53AXdIb5gzXkVtZLd8VxkQ Urbana Three people on a Wednesday night Sat downstairs which is like eating in the foyer One glass of wine two personal pizzas bowl of pasta and 3 salads equaled a tab of 60 before tip The pizza is great but the total experience was meh This restaurant ought to have a lower priced menu for the folks sitting downstairs and getting food dished out by the bartender and a higher priced menu would be fair for folks sitting upstairs enjoying the white tablecloth experience I ll go again but a 7 three ounce glass of wine ought to be enjoyed upstairs and was simply incongruous for the casual meal in the doorway we had 
53xK3kogEIaM-AdcicOk6A Urbana We were here over the weekend and its a really nice spot we didn t really order food except for some garlic bread which was cool We went there for their beer since afterall they are a brewery 1 25 for 4oz beers you can try close to everything they brew and then some I had 6 and my bf had 5 our bill was just under 20 They had pumpkin ale hefeweizen chocolate cherry coffee beer IPA s too many to remember you ll have to check it out yourself Can t wait to go back and maybe try some things on their menu Fun bartender too ask for Mike 
55vM7paAW6pNiT43q5ewwA Urbana Better than I expected judging from decor and crowd Corned beef made in house and kind of fatty but tasty warning it looks like thinly sliced lunch meat so if this will bum you out excessively skip it Also skip the shepherd pie Nothing but my lamb chunks under a layer of mash 
56nAPK0vNMvzkFU75PCRJw Urbana My bf and I went with another couple to this place as we d heard great reviews The ambiance is wonderful and we had a very friendly and attentive server The food was absolutely delicious The only downside was they were out of the one dessert we wanted to order but I would definitely go back to dine again especially to try for the chocolate cake again One of the nicer places in Champaign and Urbana loved it 
58Y7LLduUVq8M9cC0LB4cA Urbana I got the sunset roll 8 99 salmon and crab and the tuna avocado roll w spicy tuna 7 50 Both were pretty good each roll was 6 small pieces The place is pretty trendy all the servers and chefs were pretty young I ordered it to go so I can t really say how the waiter service was but the bartender was nice and they made my sushi pretty quickly For most of the places i ve eaten around here I rather like this place since the prices are reasonable and the food was really good and I eat sushi ALOT I ll definitely be returning again 
59sySHnW9Y29S8NVu0Q-jw Urbana I don t know why my review was filtered I was merely truthful I will try to be nice now this was one of the truly worst food experiences I ve ever been through In our generous and food wise varied Urbana Champaign I can only think of Great Impasta POST change of place owner that offered food as bad as this one The amount of salt and or MSG used makes the food to border on inedible A bad sign was that there wasn t one Korean person inside only Caucasians I should have known better 
5aCD166E3za1LQg_7Q1HXw Urbana Food tasted authentic Chinese Apparently there are two menus and it seems like most of the complaints are from people given the westernized menu so make sure you ask for the real one One of our orders had a mix up they brought a 30 Peking duck instead of the 10 dish that we wanted the names are very similar However the owner was very nice apologized and asked if we would like to have the 30 dish for 10 instead of having it wasted of course we accepted The place is family run by the owner and her two children all very nice people 
5AEDr3HTbxOM2zfKLpZhMw Urbana After a disaster of a breakfast at IHOP yesterday I went with a group of seven to Merry Ann s Diner in Urbana for breakfast today There were only a few groups in the place so seating was not a problem We were able to order quickly and our food came within a few minutes Everyone seemed to think their breakfast was okay no great raves but no problems either Service was excellent My meal was a Mexican Omelet with hash browns and coffee and was good 
5aqHr3GYu2ANwyw_mRUkdg Urbana Yummy 
5ayVt7M8wQ84x3_yEPl7fQ Urbana Ate here on a whim one night when Black Dog Smoke House was packed and really enjoyed it I ve been here three times now with different people Best piece of advice for ordering food avoid the pastas get the burgers mezzo plate or tacos when on special The pastas I ve had or others with me have had were not that great but the pub food is interesting and done right Plus you cannot beat the beer selection and their prices are fair Service is always fast even if they re crowded 
5BZMioHtwxfkLZiU67YjKA Urbana I m really loving Jet s pizza right now The best part They have slices all the time which for a singleton like me is perfect You can get two large squares of their deep dish one topping pizza and a 20 oz soda for 5 bucks even what a deal The pizza is very filling and I love the deep dish Nice flavor to the sauce as it s not overpowering I m thrilled to have a new pizza place in town that offers slices and will definitely be back for more 
5CHkYnDjB_fzttYc_DIJXA Urbana If you want higher quality sushi in the Urbana Champaign area skip Sushi Rock or that joke of an upscale restaurant Kofusion Yellowfin is a solid choice when you are looking at rolls or sashimi PROS Sashimi options are above average in selection they have fatty tuna market price of about 10 11 for 2 pieces Rolls are creative and taste great They can READ MINDS That or somehow they figured out that it was my girlfriend s birthday dinner and delivered her rolls on a bamboo stand with candles stuck in wasabi balls haha CONS Entrees such as the teppanyaki all fail miserably short in flavor quality and consistency If there are more than 3 tables filled the restaurant gets overwhelmed and you can expect a dramatic fall off in service and increase in wait times for your food Miso soup is bland I agree with the other reviewer that lamented the fact that the rice was a little sloppy on the rolls and nigiri I agree that sushi is an art but when you re in southeastern Illinois in the middle of the cornfields with Korean sushi chefs sometimes you just have to lower your expectations on good lookin sushi If fresh fish and rolls are what you re looking for look no further than Yellowfin The restaurant is run by Koreans and they seem to be understaffed in the front as well as the back However service is attentive when it s not too busy and the servers are college age and friendly There is a Korean market right next door and I would highly recommend stopping by to pick up some groceries or just great Asian junk food like Shin Ramen or those delectable Asian funyuns Come here on a date or with a small group of friends for the good quality and selection of sashimi and rolls the ambiance at night is intimate when it s not full They have large bottles of all 3 major Japanese beers Asahi Sapporo Kirin for your enjoyment as well 
5D-0JgE-DzegOZqBnyYIVg Urbana Avoid this place Food tasted stale I m guessing the toppings chicken shrimp are simply defrosted and places on the noodles or rice Even the veggies tasted watery 
5DN2FrI13t1pQh7vwQDX7Q Urbana After all the negative reviews I was honestly kind of dreading going when my friends asked us out to dine there Cafe Luna changed my mind that night Now honestly I d been to them back when they were on campus and thought it was homier and the food was actually a bit better but we still had a really nice night at the new location and a really good meal Important note they have entrees of course but you can get by easily on their tasty tapas menu Here s what we had Mushroom and something crostini the crostini was a little crispier than I would have preferred and it was quite salty but my husband ate all of his and he hates mushrooms Walnut crusted goat cheese balls WOW were these good The cheese was gooey and the bread perfect It was drizzled with just a smidge of honey that combined perfectly with it and everything oozed and spread over the bread YUM Flank steak over potatoes very tasty The meat was very tender and flavored well and the potatoes were done in just enough oil to be cooked well but not greasy Potato gnocchi I didn t think I d like this as I ve only really had gnocchi s that are sooo filling These were nice and light very tender and in a nicely seasoned white sauce Duck confit ravioli these were so rich Probably one of my lesser yums of the night They were just a little too sweet but I couldn t pinpoint what the taste I wasn t enjoying was coming from They were still ok The crab cakes were good but a little on the seafoody side you know just a whiff of that clam chowdery smell Plus my personal preference for crab cakes is that I love them really crunchy and deep fried y They were not mushy but not crisp The sauce they were served with really came to the rescue I could have just eaten a bowl of that sauce Coconut shrimp freaking awesome not much more to say than wow The prosciutto crostini was good One of the guys traded his portion of another appetizer to obtain his wife s crostini it wasn t THAT good We also had salads I hate beets so I avoided the special salad of the night even thought they graciously offered to not add beets I instead had the house herb dressing salad The dressing was great but the local greens were just a bit too earthy Like sometimes the base of the leaves tasted a little dirty which I shouldn t complain about because that s what it tastes like coming out of my garden too I think I m mad about this because I was insanely jealous of my husbands salad which involved an entire half of a pear roasted with goat cheese and walnuts OOO it looked so good and he didn t even give me a bite Next time I ll know what to get On to service OK so I ve had some weird experiences there I guess This time that we went with our friends the staff was amazing Friendly and I don t mean the hassling you every 2 minutes and squatting down to take your order type of friendly Just genuinely nice and trying to be as helpful as possible including knowing when to buzz off without being asked to The weird part is I had been in twice before on seperate occasions to see about just getting a table on some random days Both times I entered the dining room and got looked at like I was some moron why was I there I don t know what the deal was but maybe those were the people that were garnering all those bad reviews and maybe they ve all been fired because when we went this last time wow excellent Enjoy I hope they stay consistent and I don t have to eat my words with a new review next time I go Summary service is better now order the roasted pear salad and my 2 favorite tapas are walnut goat cheese balls and coconut shrimp 
5dQi3wvFZ-hbIhI3ej_nMQ Urbana Horrible Absolutely horrible I stopped in for lunch I had an hour The garlic cheese bread was good but didn t need to take forty five minutes to arrive and my two slices pizza forget it And I d have chalked it up to the pizza taking time but then why did the two tables that came in after us and ordered similar slices GET SERVED FIRST Hell no The service was meh They were friendly but clueless and were completely flustered when I said I m late I have to leave now Worker But your pizza is ready now Teej Way late but I ll take it to go Worker Uh wait I m gonna need a minute to change it up Sweet Odin s Beard woman Put it in foil and a bag It ain t that hard UGH You suck Papa Del s And you know what else I found the pizza to be okay I m not from Chicago I know but I do like deep dish and I found it to be only okay Perhaps that s because I was rushing now to class late thanks to you Papa Del s You suck and I hate you 
5dTDR8sBk-RZXaWLD1vKlQ Urbana The gyros here are def the best in town hands down Nice flavor not dry with the perfect grease level Fries are best here if you ask for them well done they get crispier Just as good are the Italian beef sammies Dear gob get them dipped in au jus and inhale em quick while the bread turns into a somehow delightful sogginess Urbana side of town is take away and drive thru only 
5ejFaIa435EpjwImS4znHA Urbana This place keeps getting better and better I have to admit it had been 3 years since I went back to Champaign but I am glad we were able to visit one of the restaurants I used to frequent The tapas bar wasn t there when I used to come but it is an excellent addition to this fusion style restaurant My favorites were the egg plant frittes and the seared scallops Hopefully it won t be another 3 years until I am back 
5er0RKAnXGkalZ4yBEv7qQ Urbana Ehhhh the food was expensive and not very good I hoped for better and have had better 
5EXshhKQw7W3W2LKcCD67Q Urbana The food is DIVINE and reasonably priced However their place is much too small for the business that they do I had to wait over half an hour just for a seat at the bar and I felt rushed to finish leave due to the number of peeps waiting behind me not exactly ideal dining conditions I don t think that I ll be back on a Friday or Saturday ever go during the middle of the week 
5FE_XRKWq-q4BzJuCnzdXw Urbana This Silver Mine has 2 strikes against it that apply before even entering the building It s on the same strip of vomit streaked pavement as Kam s and C O s and one of its other neighbors on the same strip is a Subway So why do I go there every time I have to buy lunch on campus Well there are no scary cross eyed employees there talking on their cell phones instead of making sandwiches as at subway Instead there is a totally friendly crew of regular sub makers as well as a delicious and satisfying selection of subs YUM 
5fghm_B2Q_cR6ZeKAZJlVw Urbana Sushi Kame has some fantastic Japanese food and some of the best prices in town especially for the quality I ve sampled several dishes from their menu from sashimi to sushi rolls to noodle dishes and I ve been very happy with each and every one I have yet to try Yellowfin restaurant but in my experience Sushi Kame easily beats the other area sushi restaurants in terms of quality and price As a previous reviewer said service isn t always the best but in my experience that s only been in terms of table visits by the waitstaff they seem to get overwhelmed easily Having said that they have always been friendly and our food has always been quick to the table Oh and they close for a few hours between lunch and dinner so be sure to call ahead if you re not sure if they re open yet 
5H-YsqDBFknAg-5WGSeflg Urbana once you ve had indian food from amar india in dayton ohio everything else is just bland this place is okay for a fix i guess still waiting for a place that serves indian food as good or better than amar 
5I11gSkkERvNkTwIXkTeGg Urbana First reserve a table if you re going at a busy time and want to sit in the dining area It was my first time at Destihl last night I will probably go back Destihl has a great beer selection I tried about four different beers all of which were pretty tasty The appetizers were so so We tried potato croquettes and beer battered bacon The croquettes were run of the mill but good nonetheless The bacon was interesting but certainly not a taste sensation The main course were pretty variable My wife ordered the shrimp and grits which was far too overpriced for such a meager portion Though it was fairly tasty I ordered a Brewmaster s pizza which was very good The main reason Destihl loses a star is the speed with which we received our drinks order It must have taken about 15 minutes after ordering for us to receive our drinks Eventually we were informed of the backup at the bar I expect better though Also unrelated to my rating there appeared to be a large number of employees standing around at the greeting station watching other employees working This could be training then again it could be the reason some of the food items are so expensive for the product 
5IPyD0gm3Do_YkZt7zSS9A Urbana Had dinner with a group of friends and felt the food was very over rated Bison burger was salty and the service was took forever Had to ask for condiments after the food arrived and drinks took forever Disappointing experience 
5i_T0kGqMirF-9rX_-Ft9Q Urbana tried breakfast and it gets an extra star It s worth the wait for breakfast pancakes are good 
5jhsIv89fTj_4XWpBvyzfg Urbana Unique place You won t find anything like it Has a full resturant and a apas bar Great food and truly excellent service Easily the most interesting place in central Illinois Really 
5JjcWpQFj7mQPl_z0b5EBA Urbana Tasty food My favorite was always chicken makhani Sometimes the manager would give me additional nan some kind of pita bread but much more tasty for free The price is low and you will always end up as full as it gets Seating was sometimes a problem because the place is kind of small and it is so good that it gets crowded I moved away from Chambana to the south west I have been in some other indian restaurants but no one compares to Bombay Grill regarding taste I miss it 
5kwUmZJPhO2OxJTKRMVzjQ Urbana When my fiancee and I went to U of I Evo was one of our favorite restaurants We would go there all the time for delicious bubble tea and Chinese food I was especially found of the House Fried Rice You would think fried rice tastes the same everywhere but the spices that Evo used and the gigantic pieces of chicken and shrimp made it out of this world Fast forward to a few weeks ago We took a trip to see the campus and made sure to stop at Evo Something has really happened to the quality of the food Except for the bubble tea nothing really tasted the same as when we last went to Evo and we were pretty disappointed If we still lived in the area we would still go to Evo for bubble teas and the occasional meal but it would not be the regular restaurant of choice that it once was 
5l-AUhSEI26sArfXhdPVbg Urbana I ve eaten from here a number of times during my college years Last time I ordered the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan The garlic naan was nice and warm with plenty of garlic bits and good garlic flavor The chicken tikka masala was nicely seasoned with spices and a good amount of chicken chunks Definitely a satisfying meal While the food is delicious it is a bit on the pricey side for college students like me Worth it yes but not something to eat regularly on a college budget This location has a buffet which the Green Street location doesn t but I can t comment on the buffet although I ve heard good things Also this location seems to have slightly higher prices than the Green Street location Probably due to the better ambiance in comparison 
5LdqhqehZqKT6ovxSdZU7A Urbana With my modest student budget I should only be eating those discount 1 bags of bagels from the grocery store damn you sweet love affair with Einstein Bagels This restaurant is within easy walking distance for university students but also affords free parking for customers The building is new and the whole interior feels fresh and bright just want you want when enjoying your breakfast While I sometimes enjoy a luxury bagel with crunchy cinnamon or other ingredients baked into the batter I usually stick to more conventional flavors I love the selection of plain bagel flavors at Einstein honey whole wheat sesame potato pumpernickle etc The bagels themselves are delicious but the real silver lining is the schmears flavored whipped cream cheeses I swear by the honey flavored schmear subtly sweet with a sprinkling of almonds Sometimes I stop in after work to pick up a batch of bagels for breakfast By the late afternoon the display case has often been plucked clean by earlier crowds I m not sure if there are more bagels waiting in back but if so I wish they d keep their front case stocked 
5liFFLKGQ8MFadpyTxZcag Urbana When I lived in Bloomington I LOVED Flat Top I haven t really enjoyed the Flat Top in Champaign during my visits and decided to try 301 Mongolia Love it I really enjoy their salmon and crab when it s available We ve always had great service which is a huge plus If you re new to the place try it at lunch when it s cheaper 
5llEuzO5aB4fBnG_Ekfe9Q Urbana I had lunch with a friend at Crane Alley yesterday I d never been there but had heard mostly good things I m going to agree with that assessment mostly good I had the portobello sandwich with peppers and a nice pesto topping I was sort of disappointed when my friend said she wasn t into beet chips as an appetizer but completely excited when I saw I could substitute my fries for beet chips Yay We ended up sharing the spinach and artichoke dip app It came with toasted pita slices Mmmmm The food was interesting and it was good It wasn t fantastic or mind blowing but it was solid and the menu had a good variety of selections The price wasn t super cheap but it wasn t outrageous for lunch My sandwich plus beet chips which do carry a surcharge as a substitution my friend s entree a bowl of the soup of the day and a Reuben one soft drink and our appetizer 28 79 before tip The drink menu is HUGE I d love to come back for dinner and drinks sometime The ambiance screams You re in a bar which considering that hey you re in a bar that works It was cozy the lighting was low the booths black might be a nice place for a casual date The one aspect that shone above all was the service Our waiter was FANTASTIC He was knowledgeable about the menu helpful without being pushy or overbearing very attentive we had regular drink refills but he didn t make it hard for us to continue our conversation He even brought us an assortment of to go containers so we could keep the dip and pita chips separate what a guy That waiter deserves five stars and a large tip 
5LMCryxQEoANYItscS9R0g Urbana Really excellent Mexican food far superior to the other fare on Green St The name makes it sound like an Americanized fast food place but it s actually more of a restaurant than Taco Bell type place you can sit down and have a decent dinner The service is extremely fast and prices pretty reasonable considering most items are large and come with sides Even the chips they give you while you re waiting and pretty good I had the fajita burrito and it came drenched in cheese with sour cream and guacamole on the side you can t go wrong with that 
5LzGiDm6UiIanTVerRyMTQ Urbana Update I had eaten at Destihl a couple months ago and the best word for my dining experience at that point would be inconsistent Last night I returned to Destihl so that I could form a more definite opinion For my main course I ordered the Brewmaster s Pizza which was served with chicken andouille sausage ale onions and an espresso chipotle barbecue sauce The pizza was nothing to rave about but it probably would have been quite a bit better if a the pizza had been served hot instead of lukewarm and rapidly cooling and b the crust had been cooked all the way through My brother s pizza was also apparently cold and undercooked and reading through the other reviews this seems to be common for diners at Destihl who order pizza I think I ve probably accumulated enough evidence at this point Destihl is not worth the high prices There are so many better restaurants in Champaign 
5mc9g55k6Cnd6vma7A6Rwg Urbana I was in the Bay Area and missed Golden Harbor An easy five Like being back in China or Chinatown Food first looks second Pay cash GH deserves the devotion it inspires and some of the quirks are real benefits to regulars The price seems to have crept up but there s no tip either so that s fine Dining is meant to be family style large portions so come with a group but call ahead if you might need a larger table 8 If feeling overwhelmed find some foodie friends and sample outside your comfort zone You ll be well rewarded 
5MCzg_BMyMrS_daba5D9Ow Urbana There is a hierarchy of greasiness among CU pizza places I never thought Antonio s would be beaten Unfortunately Rosati s has managed the feat I realize it s a new place but the pizza by the slice is greasy enough to detract from any deliciousness I thought I d try their other dishes to give them another chance but they weren t much better Salads are made of the cheapest greens the marinara sauce was watery and over acidic and horrors of horrors the garlic bread was both devoid of garlic and had a lovely microwave petrified texture I won t go here again 
5mQ3uBGMw319MnNfOOsATw Urbana We came here to celebrate a birthday It was a cold weekday night and the restaurant was pretty empty One thing I immediately noticed is that the inside of the restaurant is so so much nicer than the outside I have driven past this place a hundred times and always got the impression this place was probably dingy inside I was very wrong Not only was the dining room very elegant and classy but the staff were professional too Our server made a good recommendation for my son since there was no kid s menu We started out with an appetizer of tempura shrimp which was excellent and tasty I had the miso soup and it was spot on goooood Then we had our sushi the philly roll alaska roll and illini roll Oh heavens it was so good The illini roll had a kick to it quite spicy but I love spiciness Until now I thought good sushi in Champaign was wishful thinking We ended our dining experience with a bowl of green tea ice cream so so wonderfully delicious 
5MtHWm_E7Q6ZFdMdhbvkzw Urbana I have been to this place for breakfast lunch including their lunch buffet dinner and Sunday brunch and the only thing I have found memorable is the brunch Nice offerings though a little low on salad items Lots of good breakfast items including eggs benedict omelet station waffles and cheese blintzes and hot dishes a step above the norm Usually there is fish in a chutney pork London broil etc I d give the place 4 stars for just the brunch but the other meals have just been unmemorable in terms of presentation service or both It s a nice space and I am sure has a huge staff to keep things running But there are too many other good options in the area except for brunch 
5nF1Y8QaOcptmuCFZAVw4w Urbana I ve always enjoyed Panera since they first showed up on campus many years ago on John Street I prefer patronizing the paces off campus where you can get seats On campus students take up space doing homework while diners walk around looking for seats The food is good The sandwichs are interesting and tasty The soups are mostly good especially in a bread bowl Salads are also tasty and you can mix and match the sandwich soup and salads The Mediterranean Veggie is a fav but the consistency of its assembly leaves much to be desired Sometimes it s sloppily slapped together and may be missing an ingredient or have a small amount of it The Baked Potato soup is quite good The seasonal Wild Mushroom soup is awesome They ve had some other great soups on occasion like Fire Roasted Corn The bagel selection is good but they re really nothing like New York bagels More bread than bagel The breads are excellent and the bakery items decadent Great Bear Claws and Danish and the Cobblestones are pretty good though sometimes dry The Cinnamon Rolls are good in the centers but the outer edges are usally dry 
5N_B3lI2vcIwuecMxMAKUg Urbana pork chop was excellent and so were the sides flour less chocolate cake was delectable waiter was a little quirky he sounded like napoleon dynamite 
5Oo_JNT8aKcOkrI598ZXtQ Urbana Best Taiwanese restaurant so far since I came to the states 
5Qkeq6hxIiGLIHDoOb-StA Urbana Food s mediocre I usually get Pad Thai or Pad Kee Mao and it s not the best obviously but it s not bad either but plus 1 star for being sooo cheap and sooo fast and sooo close to everything on campus 
5R7ByBbpwk9YqxyETgRNYw Urbana AWESOME STIR FRY AWESOME PAD THAI AWESOME RICE and to top it all off AFFORDABLE 
5R8Ie-oRqfcQixRINYvjbg Urbana Service can be spotty and the space is often as messy as the other campus food spots However Mirsung cannot be surpassed in balancing price quality and quantity You won t get many choices each day so plan in advance and come in when you know they are making something you want like muttar paneer Haven t had any bad entrees butter chicken palak paneer muttar paneer dal and they always hook me up with loads of good fresh rice The grocery store is fine 
5RFOHl6_8ufsVZ3Ngb3vkg Urbana I just read that this place was temporarily shut down by health inspectors for scoring 9 out of 100 on their inspection Disgusting 
5rQ84gD_5QSHyLeswD5xXw Urbana This place used to be my favorite place in Urbana followed closely by the Office Well now the Office is closed and I feel like Crane Alley is shell of what it used to be In fact I never go out in Urbana anymore One star for serving food all night and one star for never being too crowded and loud If I only have expectations to hang out with friends at night I m not disappointed I loved the food about 3 6 years ago but recently the food quality has declined and the service is horrible We met up with friends there they had been there for about an hour Let s just say we got our food before their order was taken We were at adjacent tables outside At lunchtime Bad Why the third star This is where my boyfriend and I went on our first date over three years ago Obviously it was a good date 
5SInwpbPGMT0bkn7P000_w Urbana I love Boltini It s such a great place to sit and chat and have a glass of wine I ve been here a couple times and I will say that going in warmer weather is so much better because of their nice patio The inside is nice too but can get incredibly loud after 10ish on the weekends and cancels my original statement of being able to have a nice conversation However before the music gets turned way up and it gets packed with college students the inside has a really great ambiance I ve only tasted a few small bites on the menu but they seem to have a really great offering including desserts I d recommend Boltini for a date night or a night out with the girls 
5SVSo5jQFrIDSmMNdTNiYA Urbana Ok so A bunch of us went down to U of I for the weekend and someone we know said we should try this place It looks nice and their pastries are delicious BUT their crepes are meh I ordered the strawberry and cream crepes and I didn t like them much Their crepes had too much cream and the cream was very strong over powering the crepes Strawberries weren t ripe so a little sour in taste and the crepe was just ok Overall the taste wasn t pleasing and I will only be coming here if I have to or for their bakery items 
5tpPGatlPPPfW76279_V6Q Urbana Mexican food that tastes authentic is hard to find Maize is a place that is able to achieve this Mexican taste which is not drowned in cheeses or sauces which can ruin Mexican food The menu is small and not complicated with straight forward Mexican food options The food is also relatively cheap for about eight dollars you can get a filling authentic meal Best of all they make their own masa base While waiting to order i saw a Mexican lady kneading a huge amount of masa dough for the tortillas and even saw a man hand making the flautas With fresh masa as a base of the dishes it was hard to not order the whole menu to see the different applications of the masa dough I ordered three items from Maize The first item I tried was the carne asade burrito The first thing that I tasted was the juicy steak it was seasoned well and very juicy it was not dry and burned as if it had been sitting in a tray just waiting to be reheated multiple times The beans lettuce and the queso fresco help to bring a balance of creaminess saltiness and crunch to the burrito The burrito is also a great value at five dollars it is quite hefty with plenty of juicy steak in it which is always key I next had the Tlacoyo with chorizo on it The chorizo was a great highlight It was not dry and very flavorful Many places when cooking chorizo overcook so it gets burned The chorizo also was not overly greasy The Tlacoyo was stuffed with beans fried and topped with sourcream and a blend of cilantro and onions and chorizo The Tlacoyo looked like a tostada but with Masa that is fried he saltiness of the chorizo blended well with the sourcream and onions which made me wish I had ordered more When you bite into it you first get a crunchy bite with the Masa and then chorizo sourcream and onions melding with it to give you a perfect crunchy bite For three dollars it it quite satisfying The last item I ordered was a chicken huaraches The huaraches are similar but are not studded with beans This item was also quite good the chicken moist and tender The vegetables on it tasted fresh as the tomatoes were still firm when eating the huaraches i got the huaraches grilled instead of fried and it made the masa more moist and chewy almost like a pita Having the huarache grilled was a palate cleaner as it had certain freshness of summer food in the winter time i think even Anthony Bourdain would love eating at this place The food this laces produces looks similar to the food he eats on his shows This Mexican places is a small restraint with barely any room to sit but its simple Mexican flavors will have me coming back to eat 
5tqjAHnqr_DdoUtgU-mjkQ Urbana As I waited over 15 minutes for the waitress to return with my initial drink order on a slow night I hoped the tonic wasn t as flat and flavorless as the last time It was I ordered a Bell s HopSlam the next moment I saw the waitress and it came only 5 minutes after I pained through the flat gin and tonic When the tapas came 45 after my wife and I arrived we enjoyed the mussel in miso broth special and bacon wrapped rainbow trout with aoili The Spanish tortilla was burnt Luckily the harissa helped cover up the carcinogens Now I wait for the waitress to return so I can ask for the bill and go to a bar with responsive service At least it s beautiful outside 
5tTCiFPHNzBaE1GyW_z6Ig Urbana Chipotle may not be authentic Mexican but it does set itself apart from other chains The primary reason to go to Chipotle is the quality of the ingredients Niman Ranch pork is ten times more juicy and delectable than the factory farmed version It s also much more humanely raised and ecologically friendly Chipotle braises the pork with pepper and other mild spices and the tender and flavorful result is what keeps me coming back all the time There are lots of other options ranging from chicken to vegetarian but in my opinion the pork is really the best This location sometimes will give you a discount if you order just meat cheese rice and sometimes not it s rather bizarre but I think it depends on if the manager is around or not I keep my receipts as a rather amusing record of how many times I have gotten the Ilini secret special It s quite expensive as fast food goes and it gets crowded I usually take mine to go since every Chipotle I ve visited has had a harried atmosphere that makes dining in unpleasant but even if it upscale fast food it s still fast food so that s what I expect 
5veqD4Kh9N7H3FXltdb7JQ Urbana I have sort of mixed feelings about this place I feel like the meal could have been great but when I went it was pretty terrible I don t like Mexican food to begin with but I usually can be decently happy with meals elsewhere at the other Mexican joints like El Toro or Dos Reales Pros cheap open to 3AM large menu great chips and salsa Cons workers didn t understand english well at all Had really difficult time ordering Food came out wrong for all of our entrees I had ordered a chicken entree I hate cheese on my dishes and the entree s description did not list cheese yet it came out smothered in cheese To be honest the cheese was what ruined my meal It was extremely salty and i hated the taste of it I also asked for no beans but I got them too The other entrees had similar issues Way to salty Mostly the cheese sauce they use Disgustingly salty really tiny inside only 10 or so tables Huge line in store of people waiting to sit down We originally were going to eat in but had to order to go but a table opened up while we were waiting after about 15 minutes All and all I felt the meal could have been really good but really this place gets the low rating because of the bad service Had our entrees come out right this could have been a totally different review They didn t though they came out very wrong and I felt asking the workers to replace the error would have not gotten correctly communicated anyway due to their lack of English I probably just hit it on a really bad day but I won t be going again 
5WIOPhagtfsr3uN1Qt4c1g Urbana They have a really good breakfast special It is cheap and good 
5xp32Hj40l6M6hG6ZSru7A Urbana Best pizza in town IMHO so glad you opened in Champaign Yum 
5y1hu7IYDyHMY588ryi67A Urbana for those of you present in CU prior to the late 90 s you would remember this as Deluxe home of the Friday Fish Sandwich Deluxe is no more but this structure sits on the burial ground of where Deluxe once stood i try not to think about Deluxe when i m in legends otherwise i feel like i m looking for my dead dog among a litter of perfectly fresh purebred puppies You kind of have to treat Legends this way like a fresh puppy Grow with it create your own tricks together develop a routine find comfort in it know it s always there when you need it If you can detect different ratios of pepsi syrup to carbonated water when you drink a fountain pepsi i challenge you find a better ratio than what is going on here it s a science and they have the titration juuuuust right when i used to consume a juicy burger this was my destination of choice now i thoroughly enjoy the greek wrap minus the chicken and still feel i have consumed enough oil to be guilty the fries are awesome too good university crowd to go along with all the university memorabelia on the walls nice staff primarily made up of college kids from the suburbs who always seem to smile and do their jobs well the fish sandwich still exists on fridays but i just haven t been able to bring myself to consume one 
5y6CziSts9iX1SF_asBCzw Urbana Pretty solid Chinese food This and Mandarin Wok would probably be my favorite Chinese restaurants near campus This location hasn t had much luck with at least 2 or 3 restaurants that have failed here but I think Lai Lai Wok will actually survive for quite awhile 
5zReGpWor-1CM--3IxPd2A Urbana i joined yelp just to comment on this place it stinks i wish my initial criticism could be more constructive but that was the first thing my husband and i said when we finished eating there last week we are both vegetarian and look forward to eating at italian restaurants because of the variety we can enjoy that was not the case here the service was lacking incredibly the waiter was nice when we saw him but most of the time he was talking with other staff members my husband ordered the salsa rosa upon the recommendation of our server it was a combo of marinara and alfredo and it was everything one could expect from a can i ordered the garlic and olive oil pasta it is a dish i make at home so i was looking forward to it i was literally handed the most enormous plate of plain pasta ever it had been tossed in olive oil that much was sure by the fact that i could tip the oil on my napkin with a quick slant of the plate it had dried parsley flakes and some generic shaker cheese on top no fresh garlic no fresh cheese no flavor and it was reasonably priced at 13 sigh i also ordered the asti moscato it was flat i really couldn t believe it it tasted like white grape juice so gross we had ordered dessert and wine and an unremarkable appetizer of surprisingly fresh mozzarella and spent over 90 with a tip there is no way it should have cost that much in fact it was a bad night on the floor the table next to us sent back their entire order and so did the table behind us we should have sent ours back as well but my husband felt that was uncool so we paid through the nose for some processed not so fresh not so flavorful food i wouldn t pay for it twice though minneci s if you could do some quality control before your food goes from the pass to the table that would be rad because at this point you re sending an extreme amount of glorified cafeteria food into our dining room 
5_SORCU4MEWYPrONw9BueQ Urbana Stopped by this weekend while visiting some friends for Unofficial weekend I got a Pad Kee Mao with beef It was okay tasting not the best I had though There was plenty of noodles but I didn t think there was enough veggies or meat The price is decent though And they are pretty quick about getting the food done The cashier guy couldn t understand what I was saying when I wanted to get a bottle of water Just be nice and patient 
6-lbelIhqig-i5EiUi5Stg Urbana On the rare occasions when I go back to Champaign there are a few places I always need to revisit the first obviously is Dos Reales The second is Papa Del s Everybody seems to love Papa Del s and for good reason Champaign is not exactly a hotbed of amazing cuisine but Papa Del s delivers consistently delicious hot cheesy deep dish awesomeness There s usually a line but even on Friday night of homecoming weekend we only waited 30 minutes And they had us pre order our pizza when we put our name in for a table so by the time we sat down we only waited about 15 minutes before the pizza arrived The beer is dirt cheap the one thing that makes me want to consider living in a small town and the pizza really hits the spot I m not a pizza snob by any means all I know is when I cut that first slice and the cheese stretches out in delicious strands and the crust is crispy I m a happy girl See you next homecoming 
6-QQ1NC_0Kdiwp5S-ZJN8A Urbana This restaurant was quite a bit better than I expected it would be Fortunately the coffee was nice and strong but still smooth and delicious Since I went for breakfast this was almost a prerequisite for interest in the rest of the meal Their omelets and sandwiches were pretty good but the star was really the side of potatoes Since this place has a bit more choices that fit my tastes than Pekara I m sure I ll be back to try the food here again soon 
60LvHpNzC3EcZBAbgULKBg Urbana Picked up Ben and Brandon at tennis camp so had to stop here Plus you can get slices at lunch Giant breadsticks that are great also Pizza takes time if you order a whole pie 45 minutes for a thick crust but worth the wait 
60oY_NIHrcwRYtsEvWk-jw Urbana Just ok I m afraid so but that s where I have to leave things with Carmon s I ate here on Valentine s Day with my girlfriend and it was just ok We were both excited to come here having had a delcious Valentine s Day last year at Bacaro Hearing that Carmon s was now under their management we were excited Overall I felt like our expectations were only met part way I went for the cassoulet It s a small portion but it s a stew of sausage and beans and duck confit and more richness so you will still get full don t worry I generally enjoyed the Cassoulet My only complaint was that the wine wasn t cooked out all the way the cassoulet really tasted of alcohol It could also have just been a cheap wine that it was cooked with My girlfriend got the Steak Frites and was served a massive portion of delicious fries and not so delicious steak The service on a butcher block was cool but the hanger steak she got was served practically blue despite her saying medium rare Additionally the meat was exceptionally tough Also while I love meat that gets a great char and crust her steak was super charred on the outside despite how raw it was on the inside She probably ate two bites and just wound up finishing the fries Overall Carmon s was a charming and inviting space for Valentine s with professional and friendly staff Unfortunately the quality of our meal was just ok 
6100elIEDcI2J1P1agqI3w Urbana I was going to this restaurant based on what people said on yelp and I wasn t disappointed Food is cheap breakfast special is 4 and it runs all day Service was as quick as you can get and still have been freshly made The decor is diveish but you aren t paying for a formal French you are paying for good cheap food fast Also the french toast is dipped in pancake batter and is really delicious I know I will be going again 
61yiMDVnDZeWLYqid7V3bg Urbana Gone down hill I used to love their sliders and salads but the service here is atrocious The latest time I tried to go we sat down and proceeded to be ignored for 30 minutes even as the servers saw us Finally someone said they would get to us but 10 minutes later we just left Oh and this was a Monday night It s worse on weekends 
63kORWLbWt4hM_h_wjZxkA Urbana We tried this restaurant for the first time First off they served packaged crackers instead of bread The waitress was slow it took a long time to even get our water served at the beginning so long that we had been ready to order for a while before she came with the water The restaurant was beginning to clear out when we came in so they were not too busy said the waitress when she brought the check We both had house salads one with the house dressing and the other with Creamy Italian dressing The house dressing was basically straight up vinegar and the creamy italian was basically typical ranch dressing We did have the packaged crackers to go along with it On top of it we began eating the salad with our hands since we had no silverware for the first couple minutes We ordered cheese pizza with spicy tomato sauce with sausage green peppers and mushrooms The pizza was decent It was well done and apparently took longer than expected to bake as we were served the warm HARD rolls and garlic bread approximately 10 minutes just a minute before the pasta and pizza were served One piece of garlic bread was good the other was falling apart and did not taste right We also ordered spaghetti carbonara which did not have very much flavor It was certainly not carbonara sauce it did not even look right The meat did give it some flavor but it just was not right The waitress was not very attentive and delivered the check before we were finished eating There were 2 3 servers standing around near the bar during the majority of our dinner Perhaps the marinara sauce at this restaurant is their specialty but our first visit here will be our last mainly due to the quality or lack there of of service It might be ok for pizza to go 
649W1stfboMeiw29omQ58g Urbana I steamed up the tamales yesterday and they were great a mix of chicken and beef tamales When I was a little kid I got tamales from a truck at the beach and I loved them I thought that was how tamales were factory made tubes of really yellow corn meal with consistently round tubes of ground beef in the middle The tamales at El Charro are the definitely handmade variety and could not be more authentic or better Shredded chicken or shredded beef perfectly seasoned Go in and order a dozen for pickup in a couple of days or maybe some will be available right then Steam them up for a couple of hours and you will be very happy 
64nwdOOFiz-xw-CAb657xA Urbana I don t know much about sushi honestly I like to eat it and I know that if it smells bad I shouldn t eat it That s about it I know even less about Korean food but I think it s really tasty in general I think the sushi here is good but the Korean food is better The space is nice with plenty of tables and everything There s only one waiter that I ve ever seen there and he s a little slow So is the sushi I mean at least they provide salad and miso so you re not dying of hunger I think it s a little bit expensive but the lunch specials make it feel like you re getting a deal I would like to go back and get more Korean food but I want to find a different place for my sushi craving 
65GdDSU-Ak0x0M4x3hTaog Urbana i love bevier cafe and i fear it may be my new go to destination for lunch over all the overpriced sandwich pasta shops in campustown you can get a delicious full sized entree for under 5 the ambience is a little like a dorm cafeteria but the service is efficient and the food is really tasty They also offer portable coffee mugs for 10 with 50 refills for an eternity after take that espresso royale on my graduate student budget it sure makes me warm and gooey inside to know that i can get real food and the elixir of life coffee at such an affordable price and in a convenient location sure beats my made in 30 seconds pbj for lunch 
65ynwrXzaUJkTD5jUtw-jg Urbana Miko is possibly best described as a laid back version of KoFusion which is unsurprising since it is owned by the same group of people Miko has teppanyaki though which I guess sets it apart Also the Champaign Roll at KoFusion is called the Urbana Roll at Miko since KoFusion is in Champaign and MiKo is in Urbana Hilarious It s wierd that I think I actually like Miko better than KoFusion because it is more laid back but I go to KoFusion much much more because of the 1 sushi The staff at Miko has always been friendlier than at KoFusion for whatever reason but the bar is not as good Anyway try the Dragon Roll Top Notch 
66G7eyihOBh-9xfymQvTbA Urbana Sushi Kame is a decent sushi place in downtown Champaign The sushi is definitely authentic and some of their sushi was definitely right on the money That the sushi was relatively cheap only made the experience even better The interior is unassuming which is fine because it usually means good things for the food The Nigiri was quite good and the sweet rice was cooked perfectly The rolls we had were Crunch good flavor with a good crunch sweet potato best tempura based roll I ve had Alaska pretty good I don t remember much of it though green turtle better than the Crunch and volcano not nearly as spicy as it should be I sort of wished the soy sauce wasn t just salty it tasted like the stuff that comes out of the bottles at standard Chinese restaurants Some of the rolls could have been a bit more flavorful Overall though I d definitely go back to Sushi Kame when I m in town 
66neP-Vnfgdh5mp665xWdg Urbana The Beckman Cafe is notable among University of Illinois lunch counters and probably lunch counters the world over for having the friendliest lunch ladies around Greek Salad day is a winner sometimes it s all that gets me through my 65 hour long grad student work week 
67b4TD2vwy618V5cV7PlEA Urbana Went on Friday night atmosphere none group of girls night out first dates collage kids This large bright clean and no wibe room is designed for turnover of customers Menu presents typical appetizers individual cuts rolls bento boxes and dinners again typical Service mediocre collage or high school fumbling job Food presentation again typical quality mass market and taste bland think lab food 
67KkV0fhynGWQpDe45tL6g Urbana Now I live in Philly and I want burnt ends for dinner tonight and I can t have them and it makes me want to cry Black Dog I love you 
695cq2_44dwko4iU8SpZLA Urbana The best word I could use to describe my experience is probably disappointed I ordered off the EatCU website and it took over an hour from the time my order placed for it to arrive My fettucini was cold and not very satisfying decent tasting though I suppose The garlic breadstick was hard and also cold The salad was a plastic box of lettuce and a thin slice of cucumber dressing on the side My friend s burger did not come with the lettuce tomato and mayo as described in the menu Luckily though I had a box of lettuce to spare and some ketchup packets In Urbana Champaign restaurants like Rosati s PIzza are a dime a dozen so I definitely will not be ordering from here again 
6AfAUNkvKQ3jqFq_T5BLXw Urbana Short review I ordered it level 4 spicy it had not a hint of heat Both noodle dishes I ordered Pad Thai and Pad See You were kind of boring I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is 
6AqLo79vRMSnNom6WnEExg Urbana This place never fails me for a good time I would say when I m in Chambana 70 of the year this is my default location You can find me here for lunch dates with my bff for their fried chicken salad with blue cheese and a side of their homemade fries mmm so delicious Recently they have introduced 4 40 s which I pray they will continue through the school year not just the summer The balcony is always nice on a summer evening Of course this place gets packed what campus bar doesn t But if I had to pick a bar to wait in line for it d be this one 
6CHcOJpN8vQugq7gs7aeQw Urbana During a recent trip to Champaign I decided to stop by this well rated deep dish pizza spot Papa Del s is the real thing and it is really good The sausage is as good as everyone says and the deep dish is the perfect thickness i e crisp crust soft chewy crust with a thin layer of dough topped by cream thick cheese I also tried the large meatballs and marinara sauce which is something I picked up after living out east and it was awesome The meatballs were super flavorful and the sauce had the perfect sweetness If you re in the Champaign area Papa Del s should be a definite stop on your Campus tour 
6DZ4YsM67TFb1n08xPzSHQ Urbana My friends and I differentiate between our two favourite Chinese places in C U The really good one Lai Lai and the really fast one Empire Lai Lai is a bit spartan in its set up but if you want a great selection central location and a delicious menu hit it up I think it s ideal for a lunch time meet up with people from the university and the tea dispenser is rather convenient Enjoy 
6ehJhemy5z0bT8tuNCpFsg Urbana Dined there tonight with my wife Shortly after sitting down a buddy of mine was walking out with his family I asked him what he recommended and he said he wouldn t recommend ordering anything special like ribs or a steak and advised to stick to something standard Upon his advice I ordered a French Dip and my wife ordered a burger on a pretzel bun with bleu cheese and bacon Burger came sans bacon and when the server set my French Dip down I cringed My sandwich was sliced Oscar Meyer roast beef with carmelized onions Swiss cheese and a cup of beef broth It was disgusting The burger was frozen meat and not good at all The appetizers were way over priced Place still looks just like aTGI Fridays but they moved the bar I think their money could ve been better spent elsewhere The outside patio looks nice but it s called The Spin Zone Why There is nothing about the patio that would make you decide to call it that name The only thing that was good was the Ranger IPA they had on draft It was icy cold and tasted great so I ordered a second one only to be told they were out Good luck Prairie Fire but I won t be back 
6fc8jCcDUHzHhMCs2Dy-SQ Urbana Ordered the grape leaves appetizer lamb beef shawarma plate with rice and vegetables the other option was pita hummus The plate came with a side choice of soup or salad we went with lentil soup After tax the total was 16 something A bit on the pricey side compared to places like this in the northern suburbs of Chicago but the food was tasty and the crowd was diverse I would have preferred everything to be a little less salty For 2 people that was enough food We left very full satisfied and thirsty I would come back to try their sandwiches 
6Fg94CEzOBOK4qBzx1WQXw Urbana Can t get enough of this place I ve had a different item each visit and loved every one Prices are pretty good and the staff is incredibly friendly It s a good thing I don t live in the apartments above 
6ghwD6GYofpRVYHwZN2XkQ Urbana Yet another sports bar that s on campus Don t get the mushroom soup here even though it sounds awesome 
6gS-IWl3N2hT5kENAEFV9g Urbana I love the empanadas I think the Beans n Rice one while simple in theory is delicious they add spice and seasoning to make it really delicious yet still the comfort food I m craving And the Raspberry Cheesecake one to die for My third favorite is the Potato Cheddar simple and delicious 
6g_ija5X8TbZemLCU5dT8w Urbana I was underwhelmed by Blues They dropped off a sampler at my office when they first opened and I never wanted to go back The food was passible but having ate real southern BBQ and even having eaten at other CU BBQ restaurants there are much better options There was hardly even a smoke ring on anything it s not BBQ if it doesn t have a smoke ring 
6H-3ULf-wYoTngi-GeWfRA Urbana Seven saints has a good atmosphere and decent food Always order the cheese curds Their sliders are good but maybe a tad pricey I used to be a fan of the black and blue salad but its been steadily getting worse over time They have a good selection of beer Anyway it beats out all the campus town bars but for down town champaign its ok I come here for burgers and beer When I just want good beer i go down the street 
6hmep_x3lUR_6ksnDW4sPA Urbana We left after the bar tender insulted my friend I can see having a bad night but do not take it out on your customers To top off our bad experience this place steals your money We asked for our check after dealing with the offensive bar tender and wrote NO TIP on the tip line Later my cleared bank statement says the jerk gave himself a 5 tip That is not ok 
6ILG2CCco1TWUi_rkoYW_g Urbana One of the regular spots on Green street every time I make the painful decision not to eat at Antonio s and instead eat here I m a little surprised as how much I like Zorba s I see a review saying Niro s is better and cheaper Zorba s isn t that expensive but I ve never been to Niro s so I can t compare I will say that Zorba s has great fries crinkle cut Not much else to say it s standard gyro stuff for a pretty reasonable price huge portion fries and drink for like 7 and it s definitely one of the few places on that first block of Green that hasn t changes in I think 35 years 
6iwfAriiCxWU8Y8-5pzuEg Urbana Well crap I might be about to earn a bitch badge The interior decor to me is not hip trendy or modern Unless you think that one friend with his blacklight room lava lamps and Spencers Gifts like light gadgets is awesome In which case carry on my friend To each his own and all Got take out Called ahead for lunch sushi sampler and tempura Perhaps the first indication should ve been my order takers complete stupification upon hearing they offered a sushi sampler They told me food would be ready in 20 min Which was almost exactly how long I waited after arriving 20 min later Not cool on the service tip Ko Sushi was fairly good no complaint there The tempura So not Not tempura at all More like the deep fried veggies sold at a county fair No win for you Ko and no second visit Ever 
6JTe2xxAoAw1Pd9EPv3zSw Urbana Zyggy s serves a small but excellent menu of Indian fast food at bargain prices My companion and I sampled the lamb wrap 5 includes drink potato wrap 5 includes drink pav bhaji Indian mixed veg on bread 4 25 and hummus 2 95 All were fresh and spicy goodness the tastes were familiar from my visits to much more expensive Indian restaurants in town We spoke to the owner who tells us they make everything fresh in house including a special blend of falafel We will definitely be back to try that out Service was fast and friendly A great value overall 
6J___twtyMjttSrIydn2ZA Urbana Today is St Joseph s Day a day that in Italy and many traditional Italian American households is as special as St Patrick s Day is to the Irish and a day rich in food rituals To mark the occasion I decided that after work I would have a multi course dinner at one of Champaign Urbana s Italian restaurants Let me first preface my review with some background I was born and raised in Brooklyn NY in a traditional Italian American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the sacra tavola or sacred table I dined in restaurants in Little Italy and Brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh off the boats and barely spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old school Italians who had menus often hand written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience Their tables were often occupied by members of La Famiglia but we won t go there I have no such high expectations from the local Eye talian businesses Anyway I decided upon The Great Impostor er Impasta The d cor bordered on tacky with prints of Italian posters taped to the sides of the booths Tape Really Service was slow and perfunctory The meal started with bread olive oil and cheese for the dipping The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano I ordered a glass of the house Chianti which was drinkable For my appetizer I chose the Sausage in Crust The sausage was unremarkable and under seasoned and the crust was bone dry The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp My main course was the Linguini Pescatore described as clams mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini The mussels were borderline the shrimp decently done and the clams of questionable origin The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual fare la scarpetta which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday As expected no Sfinge de San Giuseppe a traditional pastry on the menu so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca The latter was fine the former was nothing special Perhaps this seems a harsh review Many people may like the Eye talian food offered in C U s restaurants likely because that is what they are accustomed to I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I m sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards So it is with ethnic cuisine A lot just depends upon what you are used to 
6kANUQYIaO_GisLQvDhl0w Urbana Edit Flaws ironed out and the Black Dog is Heaven Full 5 star experience every time Original review Very good In brief my wife and I have found the service to be friendly and efficient the food to be intensely flavorful and the cost quite reasonable Add to this good beer and you have a restaurant that it is fast becoming our default meal when we don t have a specific craving and just want a nice night out We have eaten widely from the menu and especially recommend the wings the pulled pork and the cornbread They often have specials which so far have also been great There are still a few small kinks such as only having four napkin dispensers along the entire bar that seats 15 or so people I had to ask for napkins which one should never need to do at a barbecue joint And then they needed to be taken away for someone else and I had to ask for them again Hopefully the owners read reviews and or use their common sense to iron out what few flaws currently exist 
6ls_H4lZpcDyI4tq2Cj5hA Urbana I remember drunkenly looking at the first sandwich I got from here and telling my friend hey dude I think I have your sandwich I didn t order fries with mine Nah man they all come with fries That fact exemplifies the absurdly delicious sandwiches they serve Cheesesteak chicken fingers mozzarella sticks bacon it s all there I ve got to say though that they may win the prize for best drunk ass food on campus It is a bit more expensive than other options and you d probably need a heart transplant if you went here twice in one weekend er which is what I just did but it s undeniable drunk bliss My only real complaint is that it also takes a while to get the food out Kind of makes sense when you realize all the different components they need to fry to make any of their sandwiches but the long wait is made more painful when you re wasted and just want something to eat 
6ltBvcczBlPD1TGFlu78zg Urbana I give Fat City Saloon five stars because they are excellent at what the strive to be A saloon The menu consists of simple classic pub food that has been prepared exceptionally well They don t offer anything fancy but they use high quality ingredients and prepare it competently On Fridays they offer a beer battered fish sandwich that simply has to be tasted to be believed I would walk a mile on my lips for one of their fish sandwiches and would love to see it on the regular menu Skip s grilled cheese is another favorite but don t expect the kids classic sandwich as this is a grown up version with three kinds of cheese tomatoes and bacon The service is extremely friendly and generally quite competent Another reviewer reported some bad experiences with service on the two occasions on which he had visited but I ve had nothing but exemplary and friendly service and I ve been going there regularly for many years both before they closed and again after they re opened I will routinely order carry out lunch with a group of friends and yes there have been some minor mix ups on our order But we order from a lot of different places for carry out or delivery and they have done better than every other restaurant in town in accuracy and we typically order anywhere from 4 12 entrees On those rare occasions when something was messed up they corrected it immediately cheerfully and then didn t charge for the messed up orders ALL restaurants have bad days when everything seems to go wrong and they handle theirs better than most They have a well stocked bar and an excellent beer list I don t drink wine all that often any more so I keep forgetting to check out the wine list I don t go to Fat City to drink or hang out but when I ve stayed there to eat the sound system has been perfectly fine Also the restrooms are clean and well lit I ve never had to wait for a drink and when I m drinking iced tea or soda my glass has never been allowed to hit empty before I get a free refill I frequently go to Fat City for lunch often making a separate trip from Mahomet where I live just to eat there As the name would imply I wouldn t go there if I were on a strict low fat diet but if you want excellent no frills pub food this place is awesome 
6mE0Eedk6VldYUKMCD7iBg Urbana They do have a nice buffet for lunch but its overpriced in this market at 10 99 for lunch without a beverage The service is very attentive almost to a fault as it felt at lunch like they were hovering over our table There was a good crowd on a snowy Tuesday at noon and they had at least 8 hot entrees available plus several salads and a soup These are the same owners who have a more casual location open on Green Street in Campus and now an Indian grocery at Springfield and Locust As of right now they have a monopoly on prepared Indian food served at your table in CU and they have earned the success they seem to be enjoying 
6Nd5nGjrgd25Fivk5yO1pg Urbana We arrived at 8 45 pm on a Wednesday evening they close at 9 00 pm The OPEN sign was on and clearly blinking OPEN They appeared to be slow but had several tables with guests in the dining room and two tables of guests at the grill We asked to be seated at the grill We were refused service and told they were getting ready to close I cannot image turning away business in a poor economy We generally spend at lest 50 00 a person there which I think is significant for the Champaign Urbana market The hostess repeatedly said we cannot serve you because the staff would have to wait on you to finish your meal I will never go back If they had been completely empty I would have had a better understanding of their position And if they stop serving at a specific time before they close perhaps they should turn off the OPEN sign 
6nDMdWZIxNsX-36FQkPOwA Urbana jim gould is fancy and so is the food its not like out of this world amazing but its good if you wanted to go on a nice date you could go there the chicken picata is very good and flavorfull and after for desert you have to get the biefnets served with homemade ice cream depending on how much you eat and drink wine it can be anywhere from 20 60 a person 
6NYHZShVtO3Os2YPm3Ds4A Urbana We went to Carmon s for Sunday brunch and the place was packed So packed in fact that the service suffered noticeably Our server who also happens to be the owner was very short with us I know you are busy but if you re not ready to take our order I d rather you wait until you can give us a full 30 seconds than be barked at The decor is amazing however I can t believe it s the same Carmon s And I know this is a silly thing but the sink in the ladies restroom is just about the neatest sink I have ever seen in my life All of that said and I still haven t mentioned the food not a good sign Don t get me wrong our meals were enjoyable but this is no Cafe Luna Oh and a little tip from me to you don t order any champagne It seems regardless of which one you choose you will end up with a 10 dollar glass that tastes like it came in a 10 dollar bottle 
6N_3xp0HHh5tuP8yWhKpgA Urbana Radio Maria is a great off campus place to go because it has a different atmosphere than other places on campus The food is pretty good but the tapas I was not impressed by They were missing alot of key tapas meals and the waitress we had the last time we went was very ditzy None of our drinks were refilled and it took forever to order Will prolly go back and hope that it s a little better I really did like the atmosphere and the food has potential 
6okM7LQiv6ZdW9Jmumw6zg Urbana I love the traditional dining at Radio Maria Does it sometimes take longer than other restaurants yes but that makes it more enjoyable and relaxing It is nice to sit outside and have a nice paced dinner I m always pleased with the specials The service is attentive without being overbearing I would recommend RM for couples wanting a nice dinner out 
6P3QIvp2_mE7AJU9qWP1cA Urbana Small dark crowded meh They re just trying too hard here and it s just not working My friend was in town so we decided to get some sushi As we were closer to Sushi Rock than Sushi Avenue we thought what the hell we re too lazy to walk back down Green With the space being as small as it is having a waitress bustling up and down the narrow aisles hovering over your table waiting to take your order and or refill your water was just annoying And the super dim lighting I guess is their attempt at creating a romantic ambiance But the fact you re sitting right on top of the brightly lit kitchen and or right next to the constantly opening closing front door makes it aggravating more than anything 10 for a spider roll Gimme a break I can get two rolls and a bowl of miso soup from Sushi Avenue for the same price Plus you don t have to tip at Sushi Avenue So what does Sushi Rock have to offer that you can t get just a few blocks down Green at Sushi Avenue Mmm maybe the fact they serve alcohol Even then meh Don t get me wrong the sushi here isn t bad but it s nothing special either I just prefer the hands off approach of Sushi Avenue 
6p7uWRokJCa1vOgOQDSOJg Urbana Whoa I ve been craving Indian food and falafel like no other This place completely cured that well except now I m kind of addicted and want to go back The place is on Green Street but it s situated inside a corrider Old Orchard like hideaway so going inside made me forget that I was on campus for the yummy 30 minutes I was inside I went today for a late lunch about 2 PM and the place was empty The menu is taped to the counter top right in front of the register so you have the luxury to peruse the menu at your leisure while the cashier rushes around helping the cooks and basically doing everything she can before helping the hungry people waiting in line That was great for me because I was having a hard time choosing what I should get The interior is sparse There are about 6 tables with bench like chairs and the walls have a weird bamboo motif that I m not sure I was getting Indian music blares from the stereo and a muted soccer game was playing on the big screen TV The bathrooms were passably clean My sister got the vegetarian sloppy joe a HUGE serving that came with three hamburger buns my mom got the falafel platter teeny weeny but 6 yummy falafels nestled on top of paprika speckled hummus between 6 slices of pita and I got the paneer Zyggy roll SO SPICY at level 3 We also split a mango lassai to share which was so creamy and thick I think I went to mango heaven I do wish it was colder but that was probably because I was alternating between ice water and mango lassai and the spicy roll Like the previous reviewer Zyggyz took a while to get the food out but everything turned out amazing so I m not complaining When you order the cashier asks how spicy you want your food from a level of 1 to 10 Now I m a Korean so I know spicy food but I asked for 3 and OH MAN My mouth is STILL on FIRE My roll came out wrapped in foil and it was basically a cheese cube and vegetable burrito slathered in spicy Indian sauce I could live on that alone My mom s falafel platter was good but it was incredibly small My sister absolutely loved her sloppy joes and asked for more bread She was just munching away The cilantro sprinkled on top was a great touch To me the first bite of the sloppy joe was AMAZING but then it kind of got not so tasty after a while But that could all be because my tongue tastebuds were numbed I am definitely going back to try the aloo Zyggy roll but after studying the menu online and trying out tips from other Yelpers DID I MENTION IT S DIRT CHEAP My wallet was very pleased 
6PdpMrDTas_ImFiw_OLnQA Urbana Horribly overpriced but on Mondays the specials are a good buy and a delight of variety I won t come any other day of the week but on Monday this place is a go to spot for sushi Good service but occasionally a little slow 
6pt2Nsij9mC6y8perMsCyA Urbana The first thing that strikes many diners at Golden Harbor is the set of rules and practices which differ from American expectations There s a table set aside covered in menus and Guest Check books for you to fill out your own order form Then you queue up and wait to pay If you have questions you are asked not to delay the people behind you to step out of the line Except that the line is never ending so you cannot get your question answered without stalling the line Next only credit cards and checks pay the full bill Cash payers get a 5 discount No tipping is allowed or expected And a new rule as of November 27 2011 they add 50 cents person as a charge for cleaning the table because the former practice of allowing people to clean up after themselves on busy nights and avoid the fee caused spilled sauces and sloppy floors Strange but explainable Lastly a soft drink with unlimited refills costs 2 60 which might be the highest priced soda pop in Champaign County 
6qjxKQ0tqVY4Lkyd48ux8Q Urbana I came in sometime around 3 30 looking to eat what became my only real meal of the day Raise your hand if you ve been there before on a Sunday My friend a recent transplant to the area suggested a pretty sweet BBQ place instead of the much closer and cheaper McDonald s near his apartment Oh and they also have their own beer Sold So walking in the seating space is really rather small for a pub restaurant and way too hungry to wait for a table so we just sat at the bar I Yelped this place before leaving and was told to try the Burnt Ends but to get there early to do so Well they were out And they were also out of catfish Luck of the draw of coming in late on an NFL playoff game day I suppose I ended up getting the rib tips with regular French fries and the Southwestern potato salad with the Left Hand Milk Stout to drink I mean if I m gonna carbo load why not do it in style Anyway our first server ended up also giving me a small sample of a blueberry ale just in case I d be coming back or ordering more beer with my dinner I suppose if I liked blueberries I d be all over this but I m not such a fan however I certainly appreciate the offer I also ended up having the one beer of theirs they had on tap the night before at a bar so I didn t want to double dip and ended up going with a Hennepin saison instead The food finally came after many delays informing my friend that supply was limited on catfish and eventually running out of it The Carolina Red BBQ sauce is very tasty but has a hidden kick to it With the rib tips it was perfect That said though the fries were great but maybe a bit skimpy on the serving size and the Southwestern potato salad was good but I was almost hoping for it to be a bit closer to room temperature the rib tips themselves were tender and flavorful but I thought there was a bit too much fat on them whether marbled in or around the little bits of bone The parts closer to the edges were fine but towards the center were tricky I don t want to imply that this is standard practice but due to having to cancel both items my friend ordered he was able to substitute something else on the menu and get comped for it on the bill Much appreciated However our original server kind of disappeared for a while so we ended up being served by a guy that sort of looks like Paul McCartney around 1968 and he did a great job 
6qnbfz-0ls5E5qmDm0RBng Urbana I have been eating Papa Del s since about 1975 and a friend and I ate one pie every night for three months so we could fill enough pizza cards to take our crew to dinner free Since leaving Illinois I have made detours of many miles just for this pizza and to prove to others how good it is The best dinner ever and not a Chicago Style pizza It s made with real dough not buttery pie dough 
6RIVLIP4S00qQTxKC1L_RQ Urbana The dim sum here is delicious I ve eaten here with friends before and wasn t too impressed It wasn t until some friends told me about the dim sum that I decided to give this place another chance and it s made me a new believer Definitely recommend the dim sum They serve it EVERY day from 11am 3pm 
6RkUP9dz3N3OCC8sALK-SQ Urbana Outstanding Loved everything I have ever eaten here Well worth the wait and trust me you will usually have a wait 20 30 minutes Small venue but so incredibly good Real smoked pork and brisket The smoked salmon is tremendous and the twice baked casserole Beer selection rotates almost weekly and they even have something on cask most of the time There is ample parking on street and in an adjoining lot More seating would make it perfect 
6Sqzs2GPmdRPqp8rnQ_l8w Urbana If you haven t seen the beautiful deco bar in this building I highly recommend popping in for a cheap draft beer and if you re hungry well the pizza isn t half bad Actually the pizza is great There are plenty of vegetarian options and more than just the old standards The thick crust is from what I hear quite like Garcia s back in their heyday Which is to say that it s really tasty Oddly the proprietors aren t burners or at least that s what our waiter said They put a little Burning Man in their logo and named their pizza place after the desert where Burning Man is held that s some coincidence 
6tJKZeLY10EarPmRiSIlpw Urbana It always amuses me how a place becomes the In spot in town and then shows an arrogance towards its customers that conveys the sense of superiority It s like they re doing you a favor by serving you rather than you doing them a favor by patronizing the place It s too bad because the food is good although not the sublime experience that some people claim Yes the burnt ends are delicious if you can ever get them Forget about seating Forget about customer service Get take out if you can find someone who will condescend to wait on you For the food I d give four stars but for the general dining experience two is the best I can muster The beer selection is decent but not spectacular for a true beer lover I agree with Dan W Good food bad service 
6Tmgznfi4pYK6FUd76jDng Urbana Sushi rock does not rock I went for dinner and lunch and both times it was overpriced for the portion and the quality I love salmon so I got their sunrise roll and their salmon avocado roll I barely finished half of what I ordered because it was just unappetizing Their salmon was sort of tasteless and I was really looking for that salmon y flavor Isn t anyone else outraged that they charge 0 99 for miso soup When I went to sushi places this summer soup and salad were usually given for free Actually I can t recall a sushi place that ever charged for miso soup One star for their cheeseballs 
6tqh-ZDheuUdCc0Oiln7qg Urbana I m from the Mid Atlantic area greater Philadelphia and this Asian grocery store was adequate but not amazing The cash only policy is annoying and the shelf organization is possibly the worst as well as the narrowest I ve ever seen including Philly and NYC Chinatowns For example why are frozen dumplings and frozen baozi in freezer cases on the opposite sides of the store I also wasn t a huge fan of their frozen prepared foods selection which tends toward the sweet rather than the savory It shouldn t be this hard to find basic pork and vegetable steamed buns that can be reheated in the microwave I also picked up a bottle of soy sauce at random and was later told by my mother that it was poor quality But for all these flaws the store does serve my needs for Asian specific cooking ingredients and has a convenient location on my way home from work The young woman who usually works at the cash register speaks perfect English and knows where everything is nonsensically located which is a plus 
6W7BiJTB_QSR1SUYWA-yNQ Urbana Faux upscale bar in C U Not my cup of tea often with bad dance music and DJs involved as well That said if it s your thing I would say you could do much much worse in C U I must admit I ve never had the food 
6WmJizOW1bS7NuTGTYh8Sw Urbana WOAH NASTY My coworker and I showed up around lunch time and were served relatively quickly I m all for fast service and everything but when my lunch meal comes out literally 4 minutes after I placed my order I get a little scared It tasted pretty foul and some of it wasn t even possible to eat without making a horrible horrible mess The meat was lukewarm and it took forever for us to get our drinks refilled they weren t very busy I d skip it 
6wnetgLM__NCbrMmbBdWdw Urbana I generally agree with what everyone else said The only reason I go to Guido s is the food HELLOOOOO nachos and quesadillas and maaaaaybe for a beer during the daytime because they have a big patio on a prime corner of downtown However I will NOT go here at night because one word can describe this place douche baggery It s basically a bunch of frat bros sorostitues Jersey Shore wannabes 30 something townies that think they re still as cool as they were in high school and still hanging out with their circle of obnoxious high school friends It s always so jam packed with these annoying packs of people that it s impossible to get a drink or even make your way from one side of the bar to the other I think I ve gotten in some sort of verbal altercation with some 21 year old sorority ho almost every time I ve been here for either sloshing a drink on me or running into me in a drunken stuper Oh Guido s why do you have to draw all the douchebags out of the woodwork Alas it gets 3 stars because I like the food 
6WsbKXD4yKb1TjEYLhPSWw Urbana Um I m not quite sure how I haven t reviewed this place yet I m a BBQ junkie I ve had it all over the country from the dry rub of Memphis to the vinegar based sauces of North Carolina to the beef ribs of Texas I m not an expert but I do know what tastes good Black Dog tastes good I ve had the burnt tips in my opinion the burnt ends of food are always the best and the brisket and both were succulent A huge plus for me is that the food doesn t come drenched in sauce That way you can actually taste the meat and the rub and get a true feel for the barbecue I love the baked beans mainly because they have little pieces of pork in them The fries are nice and crispy which I love After coming from a hard workout I was able to demolish the combo platter with a slightly too full feeling so it s a lot of food Normally I can t eat that much I still haven t bought ribs so that s the next thing to try Because of the hype around this place the service is not always the best It s small and a bit cramped as well This is why it only gets 4 stars I wonder if they ll have a patio this summer because honestly I can think of nothing better than a plate of barbecue warm weather and cold beer 
6WVmw5FUVySbVY_ERLTebQ Urbana don t get me wrong i absolutely love this place however my only complaint is the same thing someone else mentioned the service true there are worse things than overly attentive service but when you ve got 12 different guys coming up to your table literally every three minutes to fill your nearly full glass of water or take away silverware you re not done with it gets really annoying i know i know it could be worse service wise but it s well annoying that said the food is excellent and right on par with what you d find in bigger cities i ve never had a meal here and come away disappointed plus with them having handed out 15 reusable discount cards who wouldn t be pleased hell just writing about it makes me want to go 
6X2bnuWkN-cwe44_q5sVZg Urbana Placed an online order for delivery but an hour later we decided to call to check the status of our order to only find out they never received it They said they would get right on it and have it delivered in 45 minutes Screw that we said we will pick it up we would have canceled if it wasn t prepaid The employee said that would be fine it will be ready in 30 minutes Starving and upset we decided to drive to Papa Johns early to give them intimidating grumpy looks so perhaps we can get our pizza and bread sticks quicker Imagine our surprise though when we showed up 10 minutes later and our order was sitting done at the bottom of a pile of other finished orders We took it home and it was almost ice cold It probably had been sitting there for the last hour and a half Most laughable though was our breadsticks They were literally balls of bread and not even two were consistent in shape Small were tiny meatball sized while others were like long sausages and over there was another that was square in shape They also had literally no seasoning were burnt and just dough that had been baked pourly in a pizza oven I have had Papa John s breadsticks before and this was a joke I will not be going here again Pizza is average at best anyways when the service actually manages to be good 
6Yvvt1PE77MiwF4ClZpMJQ Urbana Despite looking like the children s exhibits at the Shedd Aquarium KoFusion has some respectable food The main reason is that they seem really good at sourcing the best ingredients Everything on the menu seems to have a pedigree Immerwald Farms Pork wild line caught fish and Wagyu beef are typical menu items Dinner can get quite pricey but the service is good and the food is delicious I can t say it s as creative as other establishments in town but it s done well I also love that they have meats like wild boar on the menu The exception is Sunday and Monday which is 1 sushi night The sushi isn t the greatest but it s decent enough and I ll merrily eat it despite the fact that you aren t supposed to eat seafood on those days because they are probably leftovers Oh well Lunch is far more affordable especially on Mondays when they have 1 Sushi I think the Bento Box which has quite a lot of food is a good deal Recently it s had salmon cake California rolls Wagyu beef organic chicken rice vegetables and a salad but the contents vary I think I could make two meals out of it and they do allow takeout but usually I devour it pretty quickly because it s so good Many people think the interior here is suave but if you look at it long enough it just looks tacky 
7-ph-QfXKPn8eoCzvnqn-w Urbana Five stars without a doubt We have eaten at a few sushi places here in champaign and this is definitely the best We started out with miso soup and the house salad The soup was perfect especially on a cold night The salad dressing was delectable For our main course we ordered the salmon dragon roll spider roll and tuna nigiri The salmon dragon roll was beyond words and the spider roll was great as well The fish was so fresh and everything looked beautiful The rolls stuck together very well We will definitely be back to yellowfin soon
