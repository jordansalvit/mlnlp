AwA8AjZiPyORk8tLDdJDKg CMU American I have to start off by saying that I LIVE for build your own salads So I had nothing but pure delight when I heard about this place and their salad options I finally made my first visit last night and I was as happy as a clam Yes the salad bar is slight disorganized but the yumminess of the salad but up for any confusion I had in the salad line The apple cider vinaigrette is my new favorite dressing One of the people I was with got the American Grill Burger an Eat n Park favorite of mine and it looked extra good I personally can t wait to go back and take other people 
aW_5r4RdbXT76vUN9TKGWA CMU American soft warm sweet absolutely delicious I tell almost everyone I meet that they must go to waffalonia to have a waffle if they haven t yet I would come to Squirrel Hill just for Waffalonia 
Ax1owSKsoUtfepSrQR9GsQ CMU Chinese This is my roommate from China s favorite Chinese restaurant in Oakland He says they prepare the food like his mother did but he also mentioned that he doesn t think his mother s cooking is that good There is a rumor that Szechuan favors Asian students which seems to be true according to my roommate who was able to order meals after hours Based on my experiences the food quality and preparation time were on par with the other American style Chinese restaurants on the corner of Oakland Ave and Forbes Szechuan is a little cheaper but the entree typically consists of a little less meat 
aXVuI-UY_XpHx0dSh3tH0A CMU American Great food great service I have eaten at great restaurants all over the world and if I do say so myself I am an excellent judge You won t be disappointed This is one of my favorites in Pittsburgh Prices very good for what you get Steve 
aY1vE7uBimtPTflwEXfQvA CMU Chinese The food is good The prices are good The service usually leaves something to be desired that s why I usually order take out I love hot sour soup but for some reason they are usually out when I try to order it usually around 6p Bottom line you get what you pay for 
A_LBGGaIx23iK1_4MAWOrg CMU American First impression good food I want to go back try more of the sandwiches and pizzas A number of sandwiches sounded appealing to me and the pizza topped with arugula looked fantastic That s my next order 
B2G9W3lNaau1CtaFXQxW1w CMU American This place is great Every time I m in town I go here for a few beers and a good time It s basically the Cheers of Pittsburgh This place used to be a really run down shady bar that was well known for the rough characters that would frequent it It was shut down by the city or maybe the previous owners left who knows and a new family The Hough s opened it back up after major renovations and improvements I cannot say enough about the family who runs the place Barb is amazing so nice and a great smile and the bartenders Kevin is the man The beer selection is incredible microbrews Belgian ales imports seasonals PA craft beers Likewise the specials run every day but Sunday and are great They just recently changed their food menu so make sure to take a look at that The most I have ever ordered was the grilled cheese sandwich AMAZING which comes with fries but I have seen more complex dishes that looked rather good for a bar Better yet the prices for food and drinks are all very reasonable the bathrooms are clean and the place is very comfortable no more hot humid bars for me one of the things I hate the most If you re looking for a friendly inexpensive and comfortable place to grab a few beers or maybe a bite to eat this is definitely the place to go They even have a board where they post pictures of all the regulars I mean how much better can you get PS If you want to play darts its super cheap check them out too 
B39rIE3sPJOvO_njyKF0Iw CMU Chinese I found this restaurant by accident on Yelp and had to try it The food was delicious We got our food quickly and the service was great Their menu is very diverse and you can get actual Chinese courses if you prefer I would definitely recommend trying this place out 
b3GTyynBskBWqb-X0xiQQg CMU American The Porch is a bar restaurant nestled between food huts in Schenley Plaza and a welcome one at that It s always nice to have new options in Oakland I have been here a few times and sampled the appetizers pizzas and several entrees I really enjoy the garden harvest salad which is topped with mushrooms and goat cheese Very tasty When it comes to entrees I have found that I like trying their daily specials when I can In early summer The Porch had a delicious baked meatball offering The red snapper is also very good My fish was perfectly cooked and served with clams and vegetables in a saffron broth For some reason I find the pizzas to be a bit bland even their more creative ones The bianca has an interesting pairing of fig and goat cheese but comes off a bit TOO sweet The pesto themed genovese is the opposite and is much too salty for my taste The dessert menu changes daily The chocolate bread pudding was delicious but the tiramisu wasn t as impressive There are nice little touches that make The Porch a great place to go First I like that they have a self serve water bar glass coolers with fresh herbs and citrus The Porch also has a porch I know you re shocked The outdoor patio and bar are the perfect place to have a casual drink and meal in the warmer months There is also a fireplace in case it gets a bit chilly As far as the bar goes there is a small but well chosen selection of seasonal beers on tap as well as a decent wine list A small warning however As The Porch attempts to use local ingredients the only whiskey they have is from Wigle in the Strip That s all well and good but Wigle is a bit of an acquired taste in my opinion It will not taste the same in mixed drinks as Jack or Johnny Overall the Porch is an excellent addition to the Oakland restaurant and bar scene The bartenders are just wonderful and so is the majority of the menu If they reassess their pizza offerings I may add the fifth star 
B5hkQWimbaGgTYf12Kg9zw CMU Chinese Couldn t imagine asking more out of an outdoor food kiosk Good Pink Rose bubble tea and the Bourbon Chicken was surprisingly fresh I m used to Chinese chicken tasting so overcooked that it becomes a mushy rubber but this still was recognizable as chicken and was stringy when pulled apart 
B5TwQEgfmIpBknAoNJCpNA CMU American If you re in Squirrel Hill avoid the chains and head to the Murray Ave Grill Unassuming affordable and very cozy If I didn t live across the river in South Side I could easily see this becoming my neighborhood bar I wandered in here with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and had the most delicious black bean burger My friend highly recommends the Reuben as well she took half of hers home Next time I m in the neighborhood I m heading straight here 
B6CP1UNq8yUGDOwIftWSEA CMU American I like that Red Oak is dedicated to organic food and eating healthy but the food is just hit or miss It really depends what you get I had a chicken wrap with hummus that was very lackluster but the blue plate specials are normally pretty solid The place is normally packed during lunch but if you want to eat well I think it is a solid choice 
b83smME36EwWBBIdrPhDNA CMU Chinese I happen to stumble upon Jimmy Tsang s while up in Pittsburgh visiting I must say the food is REALLY good The service was great but I only had a drink there with my boyfriend and we got take out We liked it so much we got take out for my family 2 nights later The woman that runs the front is very nice sociable and likes to talk about each dish She has great suggestions for your taste Her husband is the chef they are both from Korea and he has been cooking as head chef in restaurants for over 20 years If you like Chinese food you will love this place It also has two cool bars inside I highly recommend this place The reason why I give it 4 stars is because we got take out not sure how table service is but I m sure it would be good with the nice people working there A must try I bet it would be a cool first date kind of place 
B9qhGcNrsl81DarqYC2m_g CMU Chinese This place stays true to what its menu says small price you pay large portion you get It is by no means spectacular Chinese food but it s great for a quick meal The guy who works the cashier is very friendly the service is quick and the selection is enormous The General Tso s Chicken and Yang Chow Fried Rice are my favorite dishes 
b9YgARsHH9_69987-yJi8g CMU American Extreemly dated on the inside the menu was pretty broad everything from lots of pasta selections lamb to duck to burgers and hotdogs We had great drinks appetizers salads and entrees 
Bb0T0CcXVbrwz6xOcBElxQ CMU Chinese My pad thai was very sweet and had no discernible spice at all The chicken seemed to be of low quality I also ordered a side of fried rice which was bland and unappealing Finally the mango smoothie which has been good in the past tasted like ice cream this time I have never enjoyed the food on previous visits but everyone raves about Lulu s so I keep trying to give it a chance I am consistently let down so I don t think I ll be visiting Lulu s ever again 
BBcsKand8YAoF9YrLx0rFQ CMU American This is the strangest place but I love it From the outside I would guess this place used to be a funeral home It s very strangely decorated on the inside The main dining room is a weird pink and green extremely dated and in the middle of the room there is this huge odd fake flower display That said the food is super yummy They give bunches of samples while you are waiting The wait staff is really nice I had the filet mignon and it was amazing Others at the table got different items and I tried a little bit of everything All very good The menu is really strange and like another said there is no theme But everything sounds good I have never been a huge fan of the Pittsburgh dining scene but I really like this place despite its odd decor Skip the faux fancy pants places and try this Oh and it s also very reasonably priced 
bBkIVdlcX8HdGoFk1ADILw CMU Chinese I ve had General Tso Wow I hated it 
BbNyTDXowwiG5QH1KZHW3Q CMU American I ve been here several times for Steelers games and other contests The place is spacious though you never know when it ll get crowded I ve been there on various game days when it was inexplicably empty Lots of wood panelling and you re never unable to see the many flat screens mounted around the restaurant Patrons do get nice and loud when the Steelers are playing Hough s calling card is their huge selection of beer Lots of beers on tap and you can get small samples to see which you like better The food is standard American bar food chicken fingers fries nachos etc The service is friendly and if anything gets messed up hey no one s perfect they re quick to try to correct the mistake 
bbY5epBFxN7S2TybS3sePA CMU Chinese Good Chinese delivery Nothing to die for but solid food at good prices I ve had the cold sesame noodles which were good though not spicy at all The hot and sour soup has nice tofu in it but could be hotter and sourer Pork fried rice is good though the rice is kind of a strange yellow orange color This will probably be my go to Chinese delivery in Squirrel Hill 
BCktVmBUKAtch39Bn6W0wg CMU Chinese I love Lulu s when I attended Pitt my friends and I would practically eat here every week While these dishes may not be the most authentic versions you ll ever eat some of their noodle ones are very tasty and plentiful I can typically get two meals and a small snack out of a single order I recommend the Pad Thai and Singapore Rice Noodle but my all time favorite is the Pan Fried Noodle with Chicken Yum 
bEaq-HmCNKPLesel1D-wTg CMU American Amazing waffles Very authentic taste Extremely sweet and very tasty I met the people who started this place and the owner actually got the recipe from Beligium and is currently living there HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
BElQmb5qAtf1lpSuJhm5zw CMU American It s hard to write coherently when the memory of this place keeps urging me to just shout AWESOME MORE and WAFFLES But I ll give it a shot Waffallonia produces by a wide margin the best waffle I ve ever had in Pittsburgh and one of the top 5 waffles I ve had in my entire life I d eat these waffles for breakfast I d eat them for lunch I d eat them for dessert I d eat them for a snack I d eat them out of boredom my doctor says I shouldn t do that but then again she s never had these waffles I d eat them in the rain I d eat them on a train I d eat them on boats and with goats and in boxes with foxes Look you get the idea They re delicious The menu is limited and seating is all but nonexistent but neither is likely to significantly affect my future patronage of this fine establishment 
bethvkOa0EmEtPkgcubruQ CMU American went there for my 21st birthday with my boyfriend and I will definitely be back our waiter was extremely friendly had great suggestions for appetizers and dinner atmosphere was fantastic great for a romantc birthday dinner we had the shrimp and grits appetizer no wonder they re famous for it it was PHENOMENAL I had the pheasant for dinner and it was cooked perfectly couldnt have asked for a better birthday dinner 
BFmV-dwL7KziS347hYGSkQ CMU American i LOVE this place I ve been going since they opened When they first opened you could tell they didn t really know what they wanted to be but they revamped the menu in the winter of 2012 and did a wonderful job I m from Southern VA and it makes me feel like I m back home not because of the food but because of the ambiance and warmth of the place Low lights Nice comforting food the duck salad is my favorite without huge portions and tons of oil to make you feel weighed down And the bourbon yes the bourbon Delicious food reasonable prices for the quality great atmosphere 
BFZewd0_jejNNOSKoAB57Q CMU American The food here is generally fine but I ve had some startlingly bad service at times and was once served a medium rare hamburger that was so raw that it literally had white flecks of unmelted fat throughout And there s just nothing exciting on the menu at all Appetizers are generally good but expensive for what you get I would allow myself to be dragged here without protesting but I wouldn t choose to go 
BiFT-sVFcrRQxjuib19hqA CMU American Legume is a small restaurant up in Regent Square that serves up extremely tasty food in a not so formal setting Their menu changes daily depending on ingredients the chef can get his hands on The chef is from Maine originally and thus is a stickler to high quality seafood the restaurant actually gets all their seafood shipped directly from the suppliers instead of through distributers I ve tried their duck confit and pate as appetizers I was originally surprised to see duck confit listed as it s not a dish I have run across in Pittsburgh ever if you know where I can get it let me know Both appetizers are definitely worth having again I ve tried their lamb chops perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium rare Their cassoulet is rich and hearty and perfect for the cold winter months The proteins they use are sausage pork and duck confit along with the beans of course The flavors were rich but it was a tad too salty for me and my palate already prefers the food I eat to be heavily seasoned They do take reservations now so that s always a good thing They re also BYOB 4 corkage And every now and then they have special events for special occasions so definitely be on the lookout for those as well 
Bj4ho62PKekzoDmt-11VCg CMU American Another concept restaurant by the Eat n Park group see Porch However the latter is good and HB is bad The sandwiches are small overpriced and dry The salad bar while boasting an impressive 55 items is 1 not self service 2 not particularly inspired and 3 tastes like the stuff you d get at a regular crappy Eat n Park salad bar The only real Pro is the Boylan s soda fountain but it hardly justifies regular patronage 
BjdDuO6kJrSOFps7tQoFfg CMU Chinese I always get their yellow chicken curry rice bowl It s SO good and they give you a ton do there s always leftovers And their bubble tea is awesome Lulu s is definitely a place you ll want to go back to again and again 
bkabx6oZIjdEW8PjUSKBmg CMU American Two stars for their overpriced predictable food Four stars for their awesome beer selection The outdoor seating is nice it s right on Murray Ave but somehow it doesn t feel like you re just breathing in exhaust fumes all night I used to live around the corner from this place and it was a really great place to go when I was feeling flush enough And it s so much better then the Cage or Silky s The food is technically upscale bar fare but half of the food tastes like they bought it from someone else that morning then reheated it for you Everything tastes a little dry and a little over processed 
bkch2_V1BmN1vLV-rpSUMg CMU Chinese Best Chinese restaurant before Chuan Ba Wang on forbes ave was open I don t know why American people like to eat American Chinese food If u like Chinese food u should go to the restaurant which provide real food not just cheese or something U will never find cheese in the real Chinese food So if u like cheese please go to wendy s to order a burger 
bkTkRnAb7QT437UTXLM9Lg CMU American The waffles here are spectacular Very close to the ones served in Belgium Highly recommend 
Bkyf2O4JHmVe8amxoTHNOg CMU American I have never in my life dealt with such arrogant employees at any type of establishment I ve heard stories from friends and acquaintances about rude or lack of service and on one occasion I witnessed bartenders giving patrons attitude but always giving the benefit of the doubt I thought maybe it was a bad night or whatever Recently a few of my friends and i went for a couple of brews after work it was around 1am At 1 45 we ordered a round for last call but were informed that they already had last call Thats odd we were seated at the bar and none of us have a hearing impairment and it wasnt noisy When my friend mentioned that no one heard it we were verbally assaulted i wont go into detail it was a rather lengthy exchange and recounting that night is making my blood boil by the lovely female bartender She also informed us that they are closing early because we close when we want If you don t like it leave and dont come back we were told And then one of the awesome male bartenders finely spoke up only to call one of his paying customers a prick because he said fine We wont Yes this is how they treat they re consumers I dont care how many beers you boast no establishment in the service industry has a right to treat their customers in this manner Im ashamed to be the dutchess and i wont step foot in this place again They ve made it abundantly clear they dont care about returning customers 
BlbCg7xqDP3RbaVBjfs4Dw CMU American Made a reservation for my boyfriend s birthday at Avenue B after reading a few Yelp reviews who suggested to do so The restaurant space is small but cozy and is also pretty quiet on a noise level basis so you re not shouting across the table Similar to Salt of the Earth they have their menus up on chalkboards however the chalkboard size and the fonts are smaller so we had a hard time reading especially since there was a glare from the light from where we were sitting it didn t seem very appropriate for us to get up and take a closer look since that might mean us intruding on someone else s dinner Good concept in theory I ordered the meatloaf which was good and my boyfriend ordered their special fish and chips and unfortunately everything came out tempura fried for him which was not what he was envisioning from the way it was described by the waiter And then because we were there for a celebration we ordered their smore dessert When we got the smores it was a deconstructed version which unfortunately was a miss for us on this too There were pieces of chocolate and we were suppose to drink or dip them into a chocolate liquid We were confused Needless to say we did not finish it Ultimately the choices we picked at Avenue B were either not mind blowing or memorable for all the wrong reasons I unfortunately don t think we ll be back given the prices we paid for our food though from what the other Yelpers are saying this would seem like a place right up our alley 
BlX8f1Tf-dQBM6mbFHaD6g CMU American I took one look at their Speculoos ice cream and knew this was the place It does not get better than a Belgian waffle topped with Speculoos a Belgian spread made of crushed gingerbread cookies that in my opinion beats Nutella and any other I first had Speculoos on bread 2 months ago and loved the ice cream version at Waffallonia so much that I asked if they sell it Unfortunately they make it right in the shop and it is not for sale alone Nonetheless I highly recommend it Cute shop very local feel 
BMrm_mJBbjhuRK87bdRCwg CMU American A great location for a restaurant right in Schenley Plaza and in wonderful proximity to the museums park library and the University of Pittsburgh I was a bit puzzled by the music which was a little louder than it should have been The food was very good We both got the prix fix selections and this turned out to be an excellent choice 
bn1eF5CoXRqKFtLU_eSldg CMU Chinese Not really a fan of this place the food is just average It s basically just very Americanized Asian food There is nothing bad about it it s just that there is nothing great about it either Pass on the thai tea here not that good I find the food to be a bit bland portions are very good everything is about 10 bucks and you will have enough to fill yourself and take a bit home for later Being close to CMU it is very convenient only reason I use to go 
bN6IBDNMUPCJjCLRLY4GZw CMU American I thoroughly enjoyed my self here The ambiance is casual the food was terrific I had a pasta I think it is called Charles Pasta but I m not sure It had so many wonderful ingredients Wonderful I had a great dessert pana cotta with strawberries with a vinegary sauce Don t worry it went beautifully with a candied basil leaf on top Very elegant for a casual restaurant They have a huge bar and an alcohol menu that is extensive The bar is separated from the restaurant by a 3 4 wall so the noise level was fine I ll be sure to eat there again 
bNtMyp7Z7TigzQyZr8O-qw CMU Chinese This place is great if you want Asian food that is good and consistent I always get the szechuan chicken bowl tom kah soup and crab rangoon It s cheap and delicious 
BNz8uiglyypxes-Nj149eQ CMU American Beer selection is unprecedented in Pittsburgh great draft list with about 50 60 beers a lot of great microbrews Food is so so at best 
bnZp-H-prU3Z5tNWr_MmBw CMU Chinese The lunch specials are OK but you get bored of them very fast There are more expensive dishes which are good but the price range is comparable to Little Asia and Eat Unique If you are considering something 9 OE that s what many people called is not the best place to go Try Little Asia Eat Unique LuLu or Quiznos However if you want it cheap and a lot of it OE is the best choice around S Craig 
Bohd102xOMjM2mJabXNVmA CMU American Just get a plain waffle THEN get junk on a second one The plain waffle is how it is meant to be eaten These are great I am happy this place opened I drove all the way to NYC to eat this same waffle off a truck that drives around there NOW I am not pregnant AND i don t have to drive very far at all to get an authentic waffle Love the Pearl Sugar it is the sugary balls of goodness that make the not horribly sweet dough waffle POP with sweetness on and off during your chewing sensation We go here OFTEN for dessert TOO GOOD 
BojXiu7j_XQALr_1CTnfJg CMU Chinese Of all the places I ever went to on a regular basis LuLu s Noodles is one of the places where I legitimately loved the food and wasn t just picking up a meal on a poor student budget I usually end up ordering ramen or a similar noodle soup after all noodles is in the company s name for a reason I have never had a bad experience here My food has always arrived in a timely fashion has been cooked properly and has featured only the best flavoring and seasoning possible An added bonus is that a Razzy Fresh yogurt shop is just down the street it s easy enough to pop in for dessert on the rare occasions that LuLu s enormous portions don t have me rolling to my car before I fall into a food coma I absolutely recommend LuLu s to all the food is delicious the portions fantastic considering the price and bound to satisfy anyone who has a craving for some noodles 
bPINSyz3iRqLyqFax2vmuQ CMU American I m really impressed with the chef s ambition but not five starred by the follow through Four people in my group we all ordered the tasting menu and all got four different four course meals Some of the details were slightly off the rice risotto and black beans that were used as sides were either over or undercooked by a good ways Each course was delicious each wine pairing was great and I ll head back again Dessert wasn t included in the four courses budget another 5 for that Service was so so the waitress wasn t 100 on the wine list and it took awhile to get to the food after we ordered The entire room we were in had eight tables of which ours was the largest Call ahead for reservations Summary will eat there again 
BqsHM5uIBl3ZJ9GGXzv16w CMU Chinese One of my two favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh I first came with my mom when I started at CMU and naturally we ordered Cantonese dish since we re Cantonese The dish was a tofu clay pot with seafood It was quite bland and I pegged this place as a bad place And then I rediscovered it And man am I glad I rediscovered it Stay away from the Cantonese dishes and all their food is fantastic I especially love their spicy boiled beef and their spicy chicken The spicy boiled beef is so flavorful and the meat is just absolutely tender I have yet to find another restaurant that can make the meat as tender as little Asia for Spicy boiled beef Spicy chicken is sweet tender chicken cooked with spicy green peppers I normally don t like chicken but this place makes it great I even eat the green peppers and I still think how delicious it is as the peppers run burning down my throat Their set meals for a lower price is cheaper but it doesn t pack the same flavor as ordering from the dinner menu Pick anything spicy from this place especially during those cold cold winter days and you ll fall in love with this place as much as I did Even now back in the bay area with their Asian food galore I still miss Little Asia 
BR5531T5W_7lwF8yyGOaCg CMU Chinese I went during hour before closing so your mileage may vary Cashier comped me a 10 discount I think students get this discount anytime bringing the buffet to 7 which includes drinks Everyone there except one table were Asian students The buffet itself was a selection of the most common Chinese dishes like Hunan Kung Pao chicken green beans hot and sour soup wonton soup The food was all OK nothing to distinguished Looking at the reviews I probably should have ordered off the menu but I was hungry and its hard to beat the service time of a buffet 
brTJd446YudjHPEk9DgEbQ CMU Chinese I know most people don t get what the fuss is about But this place just continues to be one of my favorite places to eat I know it s not special But the crab rangoon is amazing the egg rolls are delicious The Udon and the Pho soups are great The eggplant tofu delight is tasty with a wonderful sauce I fell in love with both Bubble Tea and Tom Kha soup at Lulu s The only reason I m not giving it 5 stars is because I know it s not a 5 star restaurant but it gets 5 stars in my heart Lulu s has never let me down and as long as I live in Pittsburgh I will always keep going back 
bt9_Cl42YFEF1TToSmVyJw CMU American This is a gem of a farm to table restaurant The menu changes at least in part because of what local producers are bringing in Really inventive cooking It has been in its new location only a couple of weeks and the restaurant is working hard to make things smooth It s quieter than the prior location no more pretty tin ceiling 2 valet parking across the street 
btiladO5hbi6wfez9M3wJQ CMU American I ve been here three times and all have been great While I did find a couple dishes that needed a bit more work nearly all of the food was delicious well conceived and beautiful The Asian inspired dishes are consistently my favorite Don t miss out on their side dishes which are more complicated and flavorful than their simple description would lead you to believe We recently had a summer squash side dish which was one of the best dishes for the evening The deserts are also consistently amazing Considering the restaurant is BYOB you can have a fantastic meal out with wine without spending a fortune It s a bit expensive to go regularly but a perfect choice for a nice meal out every now and then 
Bv6Btdsc70z52XkTxBOimQ CMU American AWESOME HANG OVER FOOD good drink prices and really good comfort food at great prices The service is cool Note that there is smoking inside so you ll either a love that information or b hate that information 
bvnlKSTMwbOzVwlUvOF8XQ CMU American The pleasant surprise here is the anticipation of the chef hors d oeuvre which will be served On my recent visit it was buffalo deviled eggs I can t remember the last time I had deviled eggs so that was nice The highlight of my recent meal was one of the soups of the day the portobello mushroom was earthy and delicious Quirky decor and friendly service Lots of choices on the menu you are sure to find a delicious dish Love the crispy chocolate chip cookies they offer 
BwaR4HXq2zgVPsuf1aVLhA CMU Chinese Terrible food I do cut this place some slack in that it s in a very busy college area of town and it s supposed to have quick food for cheap However the food here is terrible The menu is huge that s not good and everything is high unauthentic How can you advertise something like pho on the menu and have it taste and look nothing like the dish from which it bares its name Noodle soup does not equal hot water no flavor and noodle plus some questionable pieces of meat I ve gotten sick from eating other Chinese dishes here Overall the food is just questionable 
bwC0cC2AagY8XnCGnE_-CQ CMU American Well I can t say that being around the corner from my house isn t a huge contributor to the fact that I ve been here about a dozen times since it opened I ve tried a lot of the menu and haven t had buyers remorse on a single dish have been super jealous of anyone who orders the spare ribs on top a heaping serving of mouth watering mac cheese I ve had more than a few bites and it s awesome The bbq pork eggrolls are my fave app as is the sandwich sampler My favorite thing though is a drink that has become a major craving during these sultry summer nights is the super refreshing frozen lemonades with bourbon and Framboise SO GOOD I highly recommend stopping in for a low key happy hour and grabbing one or two of those 
bY7oF2kYHGooNc-4RxNb9A CMU American REALLY like this place Got lunch here did the soup and grilled cheese combo the soup was vegetarian chili see picture Both delicious When I first walked in the girl behind the counter was waiting patiently for my order so I explained it was my first time there and I might be a few minutes deciding Someone in the kitchen must have overheard me so he came over with a sample of their OTY pronounced O TEE and a pamphlet explaining Basically it s a warm oatmeal yogurt nut fruit and tea smoothie I think it definitely shows the character of a place when someone does that The OTY was very good as well Nothing like I ve ever had before Some people have mentioned that it s a little pricey I personally don t find so at all My soup and sandwich combo was only 7 50 Everything tasted SO fresh Tip parking can be a pain but it s worth driving in circles a few times 
BygN4Ak5u9tn-QvczmD8LQ CMU American It s one of the few places on Forbes that is open late besides Eat N Park I used to live very nearby and came here several times in the last 2 years because it was general enough for people s tastes For tea late night hunger cravings dinner lunch dessert It s a good place if you don t want Eat N Park and people in the party are picky The food is sufficient Huge portions but I wouldn t say spectacular The menu has a huge assortment of choices ranging from Mexican to sandwiches to pasta Here I normally stick with what I consider safe options club sandwiches The desserts are great but incredibly small and pricey The cheesecake with strawberries is typical and satisfied my sweet tooth at least The kookie monster tastes as expected but if you re here to overindulge this is it Jazz on Wednesdays I believe gives the restaurant a nice ambience Don t expect to hold a conversation during that time however Service can be spotty depending on the day There have been a few occasions where no host greeted us and we ambled in looking for a table There was one time where the server ignored us for 30 minutes eventually we left In sum it s a good restaurant for what it is I wouldn t take people here to experience what Pittsburgh is or what good food is for that matter But if you need to be satisfied with slightly more style than Eat N Park then this is the place 
BYX5bqnlIqh7r2WRH5HPjw CMU Chinese Yo I love cheap chinese food This place is pretty cheap and it s Chinese It even tasted good Unreal General Tso you my boy 
BZCDyHc9pOZhy595KzUNLA CMU American Outstanding is a word I rarely use to describe a restaurant but Legume is deserving of such praise because it is just that good I hadn t dined at the first location but my wife had and she says good things We tried the new location one chilly and drizzly Friday evening and the place was buzzing Good sign Service was a bit shaky at first we seemed to have been forgotten but maybe it was because we were tucked away in a far corner of the room and the staff were still getting used to the space Fortunately service improved over the course of the evening We had a great meal Prior to moving to Pittsburgh we lived in France for two years slightly outside of Paris While the living in France experience wasn t all rainbows and unicorns joyous the food was of course great a lot of the time Many of the dishes we had at Legume reminded us of happy dinners we had enjoyed in France There was clearly a Gallic influence on the kitchen and what impressed us was the expert execution French food when done well means simple ingredients prepared perfectly or more complexity that is pulled off effortlessly This is what Legume s kitchen did We enjoyed the baked fetta reminded us of baked cheese courses in France duck confit beef and swordfish Everything was delicious and perfectly balanced and executed with apparent ease Dessert was less memorable honestly I don t remember apple something maybe Overall a great experience and really one of Pittsburgh s premier restaurants Oh and Jeff G s previous review mentioned parking The garage under the building across the street does valet With validation I think it was maybe 2 
c0g1WL8CHCFsify2rXS8ww CMU American In a relatively short period of time Hough s has become Pittsburgh s premier bar for craft beer Think Sharp Edge but cheaper and less stuffy There are over 300 beers available and the drafts come in a variety of sizes for easy sampling Hough s also has regular specials on craft beer shout out for 2 off the double deuces which is a rarity in most bars 
c0gCWzz5CbKbVZF4UQUVxA CMU Chinese Really greasy but if that s what you re looking for it tastes quite good 
c1A5TdqwJY_SMZ2VZ3EJ4g CMU Chinese The food is OK depending on what you order I d avoid the cheapest special menu Compared to the other restaurants near craig st it is pretty good especially when you take into account it is cheap The chow fun is good and the service is fast but not particularly friendly 
C1fUml7Kxf9a_rtYBtitAw CMU American I ve never had a bad experience at Gullifty s It s like stepping into a time machine and getting off with your parents in 1994 Their desserts are so good ESPECIALLY their bread pudding oh geez that is so good I mean this is really the sort of place you come to and get a big ole plate of mozzarella sticks french fries a burger and top it off with a chocolatey dessert It s a throwback party for your mouth I also love the decor 
C2B5KeoeU7P-40uKhFD53A CMU Chinese Walking into Jimmy Tsang s was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five 0 it puts you back in time to the 1960 s and the food is reminiscent of that era also Hot Sour soup was highly americanized not very hot or very sour Wonton Soup was a very large portion and good Egg Rolls were large slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless not very good Cheese wonton s were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over powered the flavor Chinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good Flaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white clear cornstarch chicken base sauce that lacked much of any flavor except slat it was just okay Tea tasted like American Lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea pot The place was clean service was good prices are very good but the food was just average 
c2lviBUo_Ui3BvvbY1CbNw CMU Chinese I feel for the reviewers who think Lulu s is worth 5 stars The noodles here are edible three star college area food The bubble tea is tasty although I do belong to the group of people who prefer not to have chunky taro bits in the drink I ve never even considered asking for it without the bits because the service here is horrible This joint a great example of the many Pittsburgh businesses who have not yet realized that the demographic of the city is changing Debit and credit cards are not a fancy new invention that can be ignored at will Don t want to take my debit card at 4pm hey I m not longer breaking your asinine lunch rule Have shitty rude staff who will actually ignore me while trying to pay for my meal because they don t want to run the card I ll be eating somewhere else Food isn t worth the b s 
C4iT8MvyuyY6Py66mzPF2A CMU American Ambitious with poor execution The menu there is limited but I didn t mind that My hopes were that since they only did a couple of dishes they would do them well If only And maybe they could be better if they weren t using the exact same products as their parent restaurant Eat n Park I ordered the specialty pizza of the day butternut squash and was completely underwhelmed The dough was the same that EnP uses for their rolls the sauce was the same that is used for EnP s spaghetti sauce and the cheese was as bland as you could get Had there been a little bit more thought into the ingredients like higher quality cheese feta maybe and sauce that didn t come from a can it could ve worked Unfortunately they thought they could give you great ambiance and new presentation and you wouldn t notice that you just had diner food The most offensive part was the 10 that I paid for a pizza that was less impressive and substantially smaller than a 5 take out pizza that I could ve gotten around the corner 
C6Vsc8RTU4IxOptw6xl7JQ CMU American I was skeptical of this place because I m not Eat N Park s biggest fan but the Partner In Cuisine and I were pleasantly surprised when we decided to saunter down to the Hello Bistro one warm Summer evening I usually try to avoid making lists like these but rather than write 5 paragraphs I thought I d give you the breakdown Good Fresh ingredients You can get any salad combination you can think of Eat there every day and you never have to eat the same thing twice Boylan Soda on fountan All you can drink Yes you read me correctly Not Pepsi Not Coke Boylan Amazing The fries are a little soggy but overall tasty Friendly staff so far anyway the place is too new for the employees to become jaded and miserable yet They actually serve beer and wine that s nice but I m not sure that it was necessary The chalkboard wall is a fun concept Not so good Cold proteins Some people like chilled chicken and other meats on their salads so this might not be as much of an issue but I prefer my chicken to be warmed up so it will melt the cheese just slightly The lunch rush is CRAZY and school hasn t even started yet I d hate to see how busy this place will get on a weekday afternoon once the college kids return Final verdict The PIC and I will definitely be back for an early dinner perhaps but we will definitely avoid lunching there on weekdays 
C7zN-t02MvxNaiKrwyJMMQ CMU Chinese One of the better Chinese food restaurants in Pittsburgh The food is pretty authentic and while they have your standard American Chinese food they have some genuine tasting Cantonese dishes too 
c9HqPO54V6xzERMsBgSKQg CMU American Bourbon selection not so great Rye and scotch selection nonexistent Decor was bland and my bartender wasn t particularly friendly Oh and the peach iced tea cocktail kinda tasted sickly sweet like they used diet snapple On the plus side it was easy to get a seat Love the Devil s Cut It could also be called punchintheface in a good way 
C9KdlBjpfkzCBPqM7FTtQA CMU American I blogged about this earlier this year and it deserved a proper placement on Yelp While Toast Kitchen and Wine might not have a lot of reviews sometimes the city s best kept secrets are wholly worth the struggle of street parking and unassuming storefront Don t let their horrible website or location on Baum confuse you this place was so quaint and well deserving of their several Pittsburgh s Best ratings Best Upcoming Chef Top 25 Restaurants and perhaps Most Romantic or something The boyfriend and I shared a couple apps the mac cheese and the foie gras Both were served with an unexpected twist the mac with a fried egg on top and the foie gras was almost blackened grilled Both options were so so delicious The foie gras was excellent especially to eat prepared in a completely different manner served with beans Delicious I had a salad while AB enjoyed his Onion Bisque which had crab in it so I couldn t taste for our second course The salad was prepared to my liking which included cranberries and walnuts with mixed greens but if you do not like a TON of dressing on your greens I would recommend not ordering this or even asking for less dressing if at all possible Again my preference is salads sopped in bleu cheese Oh it was so incredibly good Our entrees one upped our first two courses EASILY The menu had many great options in every different fish and meat category I selected the suckling pig and AB enjoyed the Mahi Mahi It was served similar to a cube of pork belly over steamed carrots and more beans this time white The pig also had a layer of crispy skin to it that totally enhanced the taste I was definitely too full to finish my plate and there was not even the tiniest bit of room for a dessert 
C9ZX9r3-_71xcUB6HzGawg CMU Chinese This place was OK but I probably wouldn t go back Food was kind of low end Chinese although service and atmosphere were fine Not really bad just not good either 
CcOYuI59CIM7ISAkS2lvdw CMU American Red Oak is one of the few places in Oakland where it s possible to get healthy food The wraps and salads are great the food is locally sourced and organic and the atmosphere inside is rather cool It can get busy during the school year but they re actually rather quick 
cfCrQ18d2PGUPc6cl0op8A CMU American My first time eating here was on Valentines Day with my wife I chose three stars but really I think more along the lines of 3 1 2 4 Atmosphere The bar area looked nice but I can t really speak to it all that much because we were seated upstairs I like the look of the place it feels like you are sittig in your own living room with the hardwood floors and the fire fire place The place throws me off a bit though though Toast is nice I would not really consider it a white table cloth kind of place and it doesn t really mesh with the the whole place at least in my opinion but I guess that is really neither here nor there The music playing is not what I expected as they place a lot more modern music which again throws me off with the white table cloths haha Drinks They have a nice wine selection not the best I ve seen but better than most of the restaurants I ve been to in the area Food Against my better judgement we started with the crab cake I did not like it at all the crab tasted off but I guess you ll get that when the crab isn t fresh What really matters here is the food and it is pretty darn good My wife had the Australian Barramundi with rock shrimp risotto and baby bok choy and the lobster sauce Though I didn t try the barramundi my wife thought it was very good and kept raving about the risotto I had the flat iron steak with potatos gratin hedgehod mushrooms and jus The steak was done to a perfect medium rare and was juicy and had greate flavor to it they got the steak right The gratin was okay nothing special and the portion was about the size of a couple spoonfuls My really only complaint that is if you are going to have three steak options on the menu why not make one of them more traditional at least of Valentines Day For desert we had to order two because two jumped off the page at us We ordered the peanutbutter ice cream sandwich and donut holes I won t go to far into these two dishes but they were damn good Overall this is the best meal I ve had in Pittsburgh Does that mean it will be the best down the road No and I hope not I was a little underwhelmed but I am not by any means saying I disliked the place I guess I was expecting too much I will most certainly go back at some point 
cGz4tDe7NUrcKXSyi4dNRw CMU American Some friends invited us out to Shadyside on a Friday night and little did I know they had no reservations for the place they intended to take us I should have known that at 7pm on a Friday night an establishment that has no wait what so ever might be suspect Well I should have trusted my instincts No wait on a Friday night whats up with that Well this place was pretty weak in all areas The service was horrid and I felt that it wasn t worth the 18 gratuity that was already added to the bill I couldn t believe that from the time the appetizers came out to the time we received our food it took over 1 hour and to top it off no one acknowledged that it took so long I order the skillet cornbread appetizer which was ridiculously small and although it was tasty was by no means worth the 8 they charged for it It was simply a 2in by 2in piece of cornbread that had no sort of culinary twist put on it it was just that a boring piece of cornbread with some stupid garnish on top of it sorry that didn t make it any better people Then I ordered the cioppino which was a joke the sauce that contained the clams and mussels was about as bland as a sauce I have ever tasted and I even think the mussels were slightly under cooked and puny on top of it The special lady got the sauteed chicken which she said tasted really good but was a very unsatisfying small piece of chicken after waiting for over 1 HOUR I don t think I would come back here again even for a cocktail The price to quality and quantity ratio was way off too expensive for the mediocre food 
CjbUHKJlbGSoP-MdNiYLSg CMU American Cute neighborhood restaurant Very fun that the menu changes daily They were very accommodating for me a vegetarian they have a veggie entree pre planned though it wasn t on the actual menu Pleasant atmosphere 
cKo8yvsbvPV8L4yvGQ_lag CMU American Legume is one of the nicest restaurants in Oakland but it s obvious they re aware of that fact when setting the prices The food is good but not so amazing that one couldn t find a better meal for less money in another neighborhood That said the rotating menu makes it a little hard to rate as unsuccessful dishes can be quickly swapped out for other options This place has potential to be a great restaurant but it has a bit of a learning curve to get through first 
Ckx2OWlRbeYfPkMc8U5xtA CMU Chinese Greasy cheap chinese food Ordering was a bit confusing It seemed like there s about one employee who speaks English You get a big styrofoam box of whatever meat and vegetables you order with a lot of rice underneath Everything runs around five bucks So lots of bang for your dollar Food was prepared pretty quick I certainly wasn t wowed by the food but it was fine If I was drunk it would probably have been revelatory Food was expectedly Americanized The decor is kind of dumpy But this isn t a place you go for atmosphere anyway 
7gSmFTM_VmM6baDBptf9WQ Columbia Chinese Great cantonese style soups Dumplings are also superb especially the seafood dumplings 
7IKIhjcURU6OvaHNQ5yK5Q Columbia American This place is F I L T H Y The floors look like they haven t been swept in months Think subway platform The interior has that distinctive dried puke smell that dimly lit pubs acquire over time The tables are sticky so think twice before putting your elbows down Every piece of furniture seems to wobble not a good idea for a place that sells hot beverages The edibles they sell look pale and stale It looks like management has simply given up This neighborhood is aching for a proper coffee place some would be Brooklyn coffee entrepreneur please look this way 
7ikP5TzCthEU0cAE6X8ZRQ Columbia American If I could give a 3 5 that would be my real vote The place has GREAT burgers It s beer selection is very interesting has almost one version of every type of beer so it s bound to please most but almost too obscure of a list I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich last time and it was pretty lame The service is always ok But overall it s a cute joint that I will return too but I think I ll stick with the burgers 
7Iu_K8KQQczj50ojBpY4Lw Columbia American Welcome back Community Food and Juice It s been a long few months without you 
7JCjbbFxQilCY12sKiwtEQ Columbia American Went here with my bf and another couple Decided to order food and the waitress was very nice and patient Food is priced decently Menu was ok not impressive but better than some Our party decided to go downstairs where there was music and umm interesting dancing or a sad excuse for it either way like I said interesting Mixed crowd acceptable music mostly r b and hip hop couple oldies mixed in Bathroom was clean major plus Watch out for stairs lol Probably wont be back 
7jefgjZ6KpSqe988_2L12Q Columbia American It s way overpriced the daily soup 10 and half full came with a cheese sandwich well size of a cracker and it was hard to find the cheese the coffee was bad Not my favorite 
7jEzFV9DiR_thtTbCbmfdg Columbia American Good beer selection good European beers as well as American microbrews so it satisfies everyone in the group great burgers and veggie burgers and a nice crowd of mostly grad students and a range of locals No outdoor seating unfortunately and the food is warm and comforting so it s probably best in the winter 
7jJQyx3amMZVLumOwfi60g Columbia Chinese Really low quality food do not recommend The food came out in literally 2 minutes which is more than a little unnerving 
7oLYSMPbfZPD-ydsQILeyw Columbia American Went here for lunch The food was good but the service was mediocre It took our waitress a good ten minutes to greet us It was pretty busy and only two servers and a bus boy Don t come here if you want a quick lunch Otherwise my fries and Turkey Wrap were good 
7R1Xb_O13HCTn0fz0lfYeQ Columbia American I had spotted 5 and Diamond walking in my neighborhood about a month before going with a friend for their 5 specials I had the breaded macaroni balls They were super delicious and so fun to eat We ate at the bar which was a nice option and the service was confident and not overbearing like some of the other new restaurants opening in the area The decor was great and everyone looked gorgeous Its the kind of restaurant you want to be the first to bring others too maybe show off a great new necklace or hairdo as well A great new gem of Harlem 
7ru9QV-rnVUbC0tugGWzjg Columbia American Not great This location used to house Saurin Park which was a good neighborhood place to relax and have a coffee This new place has food which is just average and service to match The OJ was lukewarm and the bagel just ok Although they have fee Internet there are no plugs so watch your time before you are done In this neighborhood there is not much so this may be your best or only bet for early am coffee but it is just ok 
7shJ5MHyjXLCY2Y-ahBDgQ Columbia American Very cool bar in Harlem While it was hard to get the waiter s attention this is still a nice spot to come hang out and have a few drinks I live in the Bronx so it s nice to have something close to home 
7Sio7sbl4Gw4_jyoJVMD6A Columbia American The burgers here are pretty good and they have good sweet potato fries I tend to have a beer here and they always have an interesting variety I like the atmosphere relax low key and the service has always been really great This is a good place to hang out with friends in an informal way I would not recommend the desserts though I have had their desserts a few times and for some reason have not been impressed by them Stick to the burgers beer 
7t-jRtSfjM8tFmN3OZ4KGA Columbia American We enjoyed a group lunch and everyone was happy with their meals I had a great burger but was tempted by many of the menu items The place was filled with families college kids co workers a good mix They have a larger back area that can host a group ask about it 
7tRxe4eVvuhYtGUX8a3jZg Columbia American The RUDEST bartender at Cafe Amrita served me and my friends last night I will never go there again because of this It s really too bad too cause it looks super cute in there and it s great location The owner manager should know that they have really rude staff on hand 
7UT7OalOcD6NWLlxj_p_4g Columbia American The food and customer service are equally impressive at this Morningside Heights establishment I order from here often to cater events at Columbia and have never been disappointed The management always goes the extra mile to make sure we are satisfied with our entrees and has even tweaked the menu for us at times If it were less expensive I d have lunch here myself more often 
7utqg2_WGe6ccHGtRMkI_g Columbia Chinese I ve heard mixed reviews and had mixed experiences Either you are completely unsatisfied with the service or food or it s actually decent I personally think it s funny that whenever I dine in I can communicate pretty well with the staff but anytime I order over the phone I get someone who doesn t speak English 
7V9OKndUtXaQMPGvw-7J0w Columbia American I just ate here the service was terrible I odered iced tea when I needed a refil my server wasn t available to get me another one The salad wasn t good either They add 20 tip to the check for the service which is terrible The prices for the food is way overpriced 
7WCcBisMED2c1rUrDhkRfg Columbia American Went on a Thursday night with a large group from work We were stuck in the corner booth behind the bar The drinks for the most part were weak The service was slow Several people started just going to the bar to order rather than waiting for the waitress to come over The food was extremely salty and not good Nothing stands out in my mind and we ordered quite a few appetizers from calamari to crab cakes I wouldn t go back just didn t have enough going for it for my tastes 
7x-MbFJ1InDRR0dJYlzmVg Columbia American Best outdoor space in the city Huge space plenty of umbrellas Love the size of the outside patio When I went it was very busy and few servers The wait staff wasn t rude Just not there Took forever to get water or to order The food was good Standard pub food Overall a great atmosphere and experience Recommend the turkey burger or fried chicken sandwich 
7x6yBhcZjAJ6SX_IyxQ1fQ Columbia American Food was alright drinks were ok atmosphere was real good our waitress Mona was the shit This place was pretty good 
7XSV8aAlqT_Kn6y5JG-lgw Columbia American My new favorite place to waste the day away over a book and multiple glasses of coffee or wine depending on how saucy I m feeling Sip is great really small but it s perfect They have a great menu and surprisingly delicious food I love the salads and they make a killer latte I was jazzed for hours The staff is super friendly and this is one of those places where if you become a regular the staff will be your new best friends I love it I went in on a Saturday afternoon to do some reading writing and immediately was told you need a glass of wine Not only do they categorize the wine by cheap and not cheap they give a ton of recommendations and i love that Also how gorgeous is this neighborhood I had no idea as this was my first time frequenting Manhatan Valley but i love it I just wish i could transplant this location further down but it really is gorgeous Central Park North is truly a little bit of heaven and a breath of fresh air from tourist infested Central Park South that has a Mickey Mantle s ew and the abused horses being forced to tote around tourists all day long Anyway i love Sip 
7y53X_mxIWE_AXLkMbTOIg Columbia American Had heard mixed reviews of the place before checking it out with a friend The menu was standard fare what my friend called the convenient but bland American place across the street After waiting around for a while for the waiter I ordered an eggplant panini I found myself needing to add ketchup for flavor if I was at a diner that would have been totally cool but the prices were definitely not diner prices A lot of better restaurants in the vicinity so this was my first and most likely last time at Amsterdam 
7ZK_rbzCXGJCRRHvbQiKMA Columbia Chinese The beef stew noodle here is amazing I almost considered transferring to Columbia just so I could eat it more often Also I would visit my Columbia friends under the auspice of hanging out when really I just wanted to get Ollie s beef stew noodle 
7zmB1iU9UeB8YtbLXvOu8Q Columbia American I will never go back to this place which sucks b c 1 I don t live too far from it 2 I really like the ambiance and decor My bf and I decided to check this place out since it s not too far from us We decided to meet there for happy hour and to watch the UM vs MSU game GO BLUE We decided to watch in the lounge on one of their several mini flat screens Just as we were about to step down into the lounge area we re greeted by a waiter who needed to take our coats mandatory coat check I m not a fan of checking my coat but we had no choice We find a table and chat for a while waiting for someone to bring us menus Um we waited for a good 10 minutes Apparently the waiter that took our coat was doing double duty and was rushing around to all the tables it wasn t crowded There were at least 4 tables seating areas with 3 4 people each The lounge is pretty spacious so at first glance it didn t seem to be a lot of people There were several people at the bar and the bartender was pretty busy so no help there My bf finally walked up to the bar and asked for menus We had read online that there were happy hour and tapa specials but the menus we got didn t mention anything about it The bartender finally comes over and asks what we d like We ask about the specials She looks through our menus then tells us to hold on She goes to another table to fetch a special menu She says she ll come back Keep in mind it s been about 20 minutes at this point and no real service has taken place The menu has TWO tapa specials Both of the tapas on the menu were variations of empanadas WTF Why have two types of empanadas on special and NOTHING else I looked at the main tapas menu and there were at least 20 different kinds I was so confused She came back and I said Are these the only tapas on specical She nodded yes and I couldn t help but to say Wow but you have such a big menu that s surprising there s only 2 on special She didn t reply ugh We ordered mojitos the nachos and chicken wings to start The mojitos had TONS of mint It was strong but way too much mint I had to fish it out w my fork The nachos were burnt I guess they make their own They tasted more like burnt dough and not tortilla chips The nachos also had ground beef on it which wasn t seasoned at all Ew Nothing like bland meat The chicken wings came out lukewarm and were super dry Overall the only good thing about this place is that we got to watch the game The service continued to suck since at one point I asked the waiter if I could have a glass of water He never brought it however he walked back over to our table to clear dishes Again wtf I take it he didn t understand me since we noticed his English was not up to par I m sorry not to be mean but if you re not a native English speaker and want to work in a place dealing with the public I m going to need you to learn English He later came back and we asked if there were drink specials He said No they end at 7p But that s not what the website said So when the bartender came back we asked her and she said the sangria and wine were still on special until 10pm What a bad experience all around Slow service the whole night mind you the place didn t really fill up except for the bar The food sucked Definitely will not be returning 
7zxjNlIm029Ad78-p0MV1Q Columbia American I ve heard a lot about Harlem Tavern and had to give it a try I don t think I will be back but not because it was horrible it just wasn t anything special It felt like The Pourhouse on Amsterdam and 109th but less personal Slightley less enganging staff as well I had a glass of prosecco and shared the beef sliders and quesadillas with my friends The food was fine again nothing to write home about but wasn t bad either I supposed I see the appeal for people who like sports but I am not one of them so I was less impressed It s a casual spot for a casual beer or happy hour drink Not really worth going out of the way for in my opinion 
7_93l8pBI5REzLZUzIfA1g Columbia American While I used to love Cafe Amrita because of the ambiance and the people who were the servers at night and for brunch I have to say that they do their brunch scene all wrong for when there s a game playing mostly for soccer euro football Boyfriend and I wanted to watch the Eurocup with some coffee beers delectable goodies and we were all Well Cafe Amrita usually has it playing it s like 3PM brunch should be ending now Lets goooo Upon arriving we noticed that there were two seats at the bar and we began to almost happily skip to them until we noticed the big sign that put a damper on our moods and our Soccer driven giddiness RESERVED For who you might ask No one Management puts a reserved sign up whenever there is a game and freely gives them away whenever they want to How do I know this Because some random bloke came into the cafe seemed to be just as puzzled as us at where to sit and the baristas were all Hey insert name of bloke need a chair and promptly sat him at the reserved section We even asked the waitress when did she think a table would open up anything open up and she was all well they re all here for the game which was sort and sort of not true since there were clearly people finishing up meals not paying attention to the screen We left in a haste and quickly went to Panini di Parma instead over on Amsterdam literally running up Morningside Drive to grab a stool Not cool Amrita Not cool Now I know why I shouldn t be coming for that coffee shop 
84QRQ2KXDkdkG7mkFnw36w Columbia American 3 5 stars My friends and I came and partook in this urban beer garden scene It was at first disconcerting to be right on a loud busy street corner but it ultimately made me realize how unique this large space was I wouldn t say there is much special about it in terms of decor or ambiance The beer selection was also large yet uninteresting However our waitress was perfectly nice and only a little transient A good summer stop 
86N3Aq_GvDaa9W9IVphlHg Columbia American This place would get a 5 if it only did dinner The prix fixe at 15 95 is so good I d go there once a week The service at night was great Even though the wait for the food was long I felt it was because there was only one guy in the kitchen and he was making each dish one at a time The food is great But the regular coffee pastries counter service during the day sucks 
8aO6ezB1JaGG2aJQsI0dZw Columbia American I walked past this place today with a friend and when we glanced over at people s food who were eating outside we both stopped and took a second glance and realized the food looked really good and that we should probably go inside We did indeed I had some of the best blueberry pancakes I ever had in my life My friend enjoyed her vegetarian sandwich I m excited to go back 
8CmQ5a6ZZJiyMo6VXmxfSw Columbia American Wow I m the first to review this place Cool Well I organized a group of friends to meet here for an evening of drinks and eats and conversation actually my Anti Valentine s Day celebration We were seated in the restaurant large group and we liked the look and feel of the place although it could be cozier Ultimately there were about 10 11 of us The drinks were mostly outstanding great Key Lime Pie martini and the Coco jito was fab as well and the food was pretty good My roommate had the Media Noche and felt that the pork could have been better and that it was rather dry and was lacking the cheese and that the Cheese Steak Egg Rolls should have had cheese IN them rather than just in the dipping sauce She s a chef with pretty high standards but I got the Pernil Napoleon great idea good execution and agree that the pork really had no flavor which is unforgivable for something labeled Pernil Should be brimming with flavor Didn t hear any complaints about the other food ordered I also did the sliders which were lovely and well presented I think some of the other things were Albondiga Meatballs Bruschetta Parmesan Spinach Artichoke Dip Saganaki and the Mediterranean Spreads All in all we liked the place The waitress was a little abrupt here and there and the place wasn t THAT busy but the hostess was delightful and they handled the final checkout very well and with much patience I do want to return to try the Lounge downstairs and to have a full scale dinner I ll re post when I do 
8D7E6Cjgm3b2trgUXsXdiQ Columbia American Chicken Apple Rosemary Sausage 7 Grain Waffle The Waffle come with brown sugar not honey so it is still crispy when I finish it The dried apple is not too sweet nor sour The best waffle I ve had There are also some almond I feel so healthy I saw someone at next table eating biscuit sandwich It looks sooooo delicious Latte is great but next time I will try my friend s recommandation of Cranberry Margarita and Wasabi Hari Mari 
8fYHm9jsHj0McIYgqvO8dQ Columbia Chinese I seriously crave dumplings and East Dumpling House really hits the spot The dumplings are very flavorful and the skin is never too thick I especially love the shitake mushroom dumplings My only complaint is that they can be a little greasy even the steamed ones the meat just seems like its a little fattier than normal 
8KF733tVRUOHf7voCAjHEw Columbia American I had walked by HFB prior to dining there liked the vibe and atmosphere and looked forward to spending my time and money at a local establishment However the actual experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I decided to write a Yelp review to make others aware of the situation they were walking into Our experience started pleasantly enough with the kind and polite hostess greeting us and quoting a table wait time that was far longer than in reality We sat and were soon greeted by our waiter who was friendly but a bit less polished than we d expected Nonetheless he was polite and attentive so all was well We ordered an appetizer for the table to share as well as drinks for 2 out of 3 patrons 30 minutes and a not so packed restaurant later we had no appetizer I asked the waiter who seemed to often be standing around not doing much when we could expect the food and he said don t worry its coming 10 minutes later Sorry everything is backed up The kitchen just asked about your food so I know its coming I m not sure why the kitchen would ask the waiter about our food but we assumed the restaurant was still working out kinks so we let it go 45 minutes after ordering we were brought the macaroni and cheese bites appetizer and were dismayed to find three blocks of deep fried breaded food It didn t seem like the type of item that took more than 5 minutes to make and it wasn t explained why it instead took 9x that amount of time We ate the appetizer though we were unimpressed When the waiter came to clear our plate a woman in our party said Can I tell you something Those weren t worth the wait politely That s it I jumped in and said yeah they weren t very flavorful The waiter apologized and we told him that we just wanted to give them feedback as they were a new restaurant 15 minutes later we got our meals though they messed up my order and brought cold fries with another We didn t complain finished our meals and were surprised when the waiter brought free drinks for the two of us that were drinking as an apology for the appetizer We accepted them but assured him that we didn t need any compensation and were just giving feedback He then approached the third person who wasn t and said I only have a two drink maximum Sorry I can t bring you anything When we asked who set the maximum he responded that the bartender did We replied that since the three of us shared the appetizer something comping all of us would be more appropriate than drinks for the two patrons but that we didn t need freebies anyway so not to worry about it Again general commentary Well we were quite surprised when the owner came up to our table and loudly and defensively asked us what was wrong with the macaroni and cheese bites and why we didn t like them Surprised we repeated that we wanted to give feedback and that we thought they could use more flavor He again loudly and defensively said that he was surprised since everybody likes them and that in fact he was making them for an event for Harlem Week completely oblivious to our distaste and the looks of surprise from other patrons He left our table abruptly at which time the table behind us leaned in and shared that they didn t like said appetizer either and in fact that the food overall was quite forgettable and commented on the inappropriate reaction of the owner We thought it had ended there but five minutes later Owner s back I really can t believe you didn t like that dish Nobody else has ever said that We commented that maybe they just hadn t told him or that we were the only ones who felt that way but again pointed out that we just wanted to give a new business useful feedback He then quite inappropriately said Well I mean you finished it You ate it all So I m not sure what that s about At this point I was fed up I told him that we never said the food was awful just that we thought it needed more flavor and never asked for compensation We went on to tell him that in general we thought the food was a bit bland but again were just giving constructive criticism To which he retorted well I ll take that under construction and offered to remove the appetizer from the bill We said it was fine didn t mind paying for it and left Needless to say I won t be back The food was nothing to write home about but decent The service was forgivable given the place is in its early days The owner s behavior however was not I ll give my hard earned money to another place Long review but you ve been warned 
8kig0KaIOH-gEG6Sk_1TiQ Columbia American Nice place if your single 
8k_doiz3PTj1CwslYdrhKg Columbia American This place sucks so bad that I m starting a review while I m still here DO NOT EAT HERE IF I COULD RATE IT ZERO STARS I WOULD Why Because Horrible service Rotting yellowing slimy lettuce Hair on plate Cold coffee then returned too hot to drink coffee running down the sides as if it had been microwaved for several minutes plunked on the table with no comment Horrible service all food check etc was plunked on the table with no comment no check back cold eggs ok slightly lukewarm as if reheated Dirty condiment containers All the food tasted like three day old leftovers dried rubbery potatoes chewy rubbery omelette you could bounce the French toast Did I say horrible service The water was good and the glasses were clean The busser was somewhat attentive and seemed kind but inept The only reason I ate at all is because I was starving and I didn t have time or money to wait in line at the Kitchenette Seriously I know it s hard to be picky about breakfast in this neighborhood because it s all basically subpar but this place made the Deluxe seem fancy and Tom s gourmet I d rather have diner gut from greasy eggs anyday at least they re served hot I m actually depressed after eating here and dealing with such an obviously hateful server who needs to work somewhere where she doesn t have to talk to people Wow That sucked 
8LLfRVYIRi1JlQqFYJnyww Columbia American All in all a good brunch But not worth the cost Personally I feel local vs organic is an even trade environmentally and nutritionally They could trim some cost by going local over organic and pass that on to the customer They don t want to hear it from me But I digress on to the review This was my first time here I d heard about the wait and I was ready to wait We were seated in under 10 minutes Timing is everything Very nice We sat at a great corner table in the back room Clean cozy atmosphere people with kids were all under control Very nice The service was good it took a while to get drinks Not so nice but okay we re new here Rule 1 at brunch get the water coffee and juice down quick The rest can come whenever The food was very good I had the litmus test for any brunch establishment The Eggs Benedict classic hollandaise North Country Canadian bacon whole wheat buttermilk Biscuit Hollandaise was fresh the egg was runny all good so far My wife had the Brioche French Toast mixed berries house made lemon curd warm maple butter at the recommendation of our waiter and she was very happy with her order We shared some sides we were starving and we tend to over order in a new place to test the waters The Double Cut Bacon was just okay maybe 1 5 cut and the Hash Browns were not revolutionary All good but nothing mind blowing What I was really hoping to be mind blowing was the Prairie Mary organic Prairie vodka house made bloody mary mix and celery stalk served tall If you re going to have a signature or special drink make it so good that the custy wants another It was just okay maybe it needed another shot of voddy but I had time for and usually have but declined another I would go back if the whole thing wasn t almost 80 bucks That s twice what brunch at Isabella s or Ocean grill costs and the food is comparable 
8LVjImx08V-nb93V8L9L0A Columbia American I have been wanting to check out this place for brunch for a while and finally did so today The wait was pretty intimidating 30 45 minutes but I m glad we hung around because we only actually waited around 15 minutes The service was quick and efficient We didn t have the most pleasant server but my water glass stayed full and he took our order and delivered our food in a very timely manner Now for the food I got the Truffled quiche and I loved every bite of it It had a very different texture than I am used to very creamy and gooey but it complimented the flaky crust perfectly The salad it came with was simply lettuce and they were not so fresh I would have loved some cherry tomatoes in there My sister got the sausage and eggs I tried some and loved the sausage but she found it a little too sweet The potato carrot hash was 98 potato I have been here before for lunch and ordered this side and I remembered it being much more flavorful and with a lot more carrot so it was disappointing However the biggest faux pas of the meal was my sister s eggs she ordered them scrambled and they came undercooked which made them repulsive and inedible It was busy but for a place that is so expensive and popular for brunch it s kind of unfathomable they would mess up something so simple Overall the food averaged out to good the coffee was strong and tasty and there is a lot more on the menu we want to try so we will be going back just looking for more consistent quality 
8LWKR4IPHriA4VaTVjVazg Columbia American I had heard such wonderful things about this place and after coming here both for dinner and brunch I ve gotten a 360 view They have a wonderful selection of organic and local beers to start off with I didn t try the cocktails but they were tempting to say the least In fact they have a lot of local and sustainable fair on the menu which is always very nice I had a delicious salmon and fried potato salad over a bed of parsley which just blew my mind I m not a huge salad person but I left feeling very full I came here a few days later for brunch We managed to snag a table in the shade outside the wait for an indoor table looked long but not all tables are shaded so watch out on a hot summer day We saw several B E L T s walk by bacon lettuce tomato and egg on sourdough yum But I opted for a more traditional house made apple sausage and eggs with carrot hashbrowns Filling and delicious My friend had the blueberry pancakes which came with a syrup that tasted like brown sugar and butter So decadent and so good The service was great both times The waiters quickly came by and so did our food I will be eating here whenever I get the chance 
8MfEpG9QuTaPhZpAlWS13A Columbia American Love it Great food great ambiance great drinks quick service and great location close to my job and home 
8ov3SqWdVtm5edIzjBqjAQ Columbia American Hmm surprised to see this place rated so low I suppose I understand the price point being high for the neighborhood but the food quality and portions justified the prices IMO We had a great experience here I thought the food was delicious and had no gripes with the service We were quite a large party of over 10 ppl with no reservations on a Sunday night We did apps and drinks at the bar and then had dinner in their private room as it was a slow night My gf and I shared the calamari app which was huge and really delicious and then the miso salmon entree which was also really excellent No one at the table had complaints about their meals or drinks and the bite I had of a friend s dessert was also delicious Two thumbs up from me 
8OVQ_fxr3lBQ6s9FC0MP8Q Columbia Chinese Ugh Occasionally ok all the time I have this craving for greasy chinese I m not too picky about my greasy chinese I just want it to taste good I mean might as well be delicious if I m going to consume my day s worth of calories This place was a major disappointment We ordered take out and the delivery was speedy However the ocean scallops stir fry hunan style was disgusting Bland and the asian mushrooms tasted old Crab rangoon had no flavor just greasy fried dough The hot and sour soup was decent but it didn t have much to it besides the broth Skip Empire Corner and go elsewhere chances are you will get far better chinese food somewhere else I wish I would have read the yelp reviews before ordering Oh well 
8oYyC1roXLQF7P9OR5d7bg Columbia American Great crowd Good drinks Awesome outdoor space Food is hit or miss Stick to the basics Great for people watching Right by the subway An excellent place to hang out on a nice day 
8sHY-7pfDlGTp1M9YhvC2g Columbia American This is the kind of brunch place that I thought existed only in my minds eye version of the Upper West Side Yes the wait feels long but it is very short for Manhattan and yes you must spend it shoulder to shoulder with dozens of cool people who seem to have gotten out of bed significantly better groomed than you but by being here maybe you are one of those cool people but most importantly the food is quite good I ve gotten the biscuit sandwich and the sausage eggs both of which were extremely tasty and satisfying though also very rich I almost regret that the savory dishes are so good that I can never be tempted into something sweet like that brioche french toast But I guess that s what sharing is for I haven t had it yet but I m already dreaming of the burger 
8sqTddT_1ZlXMNhlj5Sqcg Columbia American I came here late at night prior to closing with a friend who was on a raw food diet She ended up with a salad and I got the organic salmon Oh my It was amazing They fried the salmon skin to a thin crisp and seasoned it well So good And the salmon was done perfectly Moist and slightly pink in the center it sat on top of some noodles and a broth I would have liked a thicker broth something meat based but that s ok I m surprised they could whip together my dish in such a short period of time and the quality of the food did not decline closer to closing I will have to try this place a couple more times to make a sound decision but so far so good 
8sWztQbBpgD5JKTypKsMPA Columbia American Good atmosphere where the grown folks music plays softly in the background Typical 11 coctails and 12 angus hamburgers with cheese and grilled onions Sweet potato fries were hot and delicious i would recommend this place to my friends k 
8VDOBtl65Dyi98Q-SAgi_A Columbia American May 1 2011 We went to brunch this morning with a cousin from out of town Our son lives on W 123rd so it was convenient Smoked salmon eggs benedict was cold and soggy but after waiting almost 45 minutes I was hungry Big mistake suffered a really bad upset stomach later My husband ordered French toast which was served COLD and when he sent it back it was returned to the table still cold We have eaten there before and knew the service was S L O W but today was the worst We will not go back McDonalds would have been better 
8WF4mErPe1j0sb3TnscE2w Columbia American My husband and I wanted to venture out of the usual UWS restaurants we frequent so we headed to Harlem Tavern The space is beautiful and really surprised us We ordered the Oysters Wedge Salad Burger and Steak Overall great night out and if we were uptown again we would stop by 
8wotgCIGh8TU-J-_ynz_nQ Columbia Chinese Writing this as I eat them They are super tasty The wrapper is thin but nice and chewy mucho importante when it comes to dumpling quality Am eating the shitake mushroom basil and chicken dumplings and I m in love The combination of flavors is a winner Definitely going to check them out again Can t wait to eat all the other types they have 
8X3jYvwXPuT7ZWLiAMha_w Columbia Chinese Mediocre food combined with the worst service in New York We ask the waitress to make one dish extra spicy and when it arrives we ask which one was extra spicy and she goes THEY ARE ALL SPICY and leaves They have a terrible attitude and they stand over your table watching while you write in the tip We were going to give them a below average tip 13 and then they complain and say it is a mandatory 15 when their service is so bad that it really doesn t warrant tip at all They are only in business because desperate college students do not have many options for food in this area I will never eat here again The beef stew noodle is just okay They suck 
8XdMgIw-E7YVjJHn4llXVA Columbia American We live a block away and always passed by this place One night we ventured in and it was a delight The beers that we had were amazing and due to their great selection we were able to try a variety throughout the night Their wine was also very good I had a rose but the glass was fairly empty for the price I paid The service was good the lady was very warm and had great energy The food was very good I had the grassfed burger my boyfriend had the fried chicken and his friend had the duck burger They were all outstanding my only complaint would be the salad they served on the side It didn t have any dressing and consisted of lettuce that s all Not very great ambiance if you are sitting by the windows but inside is very tasteful A great place to eat in the neighborhood 
8YHt8sLizFo_i2XZX0YAIg Columbia American Oh Toast I used to love you Then you had some staff rotations that left service a bit spotty The food is still delicious and the staff are always polite Honestly I don t think it s their fault There just really needs to be more people working during brunch hours so that customers don t wait say 15 minutes before being offered water and a menu On the other hand I brought an out of town guest here last year and she proclaimed after eating her vegetable quiche that it was the best brunch I ve ever had One more note Toast has a ridiculous policy that says parties of two cannot be seated at four tops under any circumstances This has led to me and my boyfriend having to wait for a table even though there were one or more available Or I should say we were ASKED to wait for a table There are too many decent restaurants in the neighborhood for me to be willing to sit around and wait when there are empty tables four seaters at the ready 
91NoyWzCcVM0hLkp-Ev4Tw Columbia American This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city Their brunch is amazing I had the french toast with caramelized bananas and pecans and it comes with this amazing maple butter that Clinton St Baking Co also has which is just simply HEAVEN SOOOOO good For dinner you can never go wrong with the rice bowl Also had the burger which was deelish I can t give this place enough stars They rock my world They had a kitchen fire about 6 weeks ago and still haven t re opened sadly Cant wait until they re open again 
92FYA3IkNrapHKV8-K86iA Columbia Chinese Great neighborhood spot and wonderful to have a good dumpling place in Manhattan Valley I thought the dumplings were excellent and big and the scallion pancake was also really really yummy You can definitely tell that the dumplings are hand made seemingly to order and the staff is very friendly and welcoming If you re thinking of going here today for lunch or dinner definitely give it a try I don t think you ll be disappointed 
92qgDS2kfNinQ6VU49xrlg Columbia American Biz cas food with mind blowingly slow service and suburban decor wasting a perfectly good spot right next to where I work Maybe you won t be pissed if you are visiting Columbia and your company is going to reimburse you for your terrible meal but man stand up for yourself So fine there are plenty of bad biz cas restaurants out there I was willing to just ignore Amsterdam Restaurant until I got pulled there for some drinks with friends I ordered a 6 pint of Weihenstephan and it came in a falsie Sweet thanks for screwing me out of the extra 2 ounces and not cleaning your beer lines properly If you really need to eat right on Amsterdam then walk up another block to Haakon s Hall I may have mixed feelings about HH but the food is hands down and obviously more inspired there 
92WlA23sSLcCWeTtBVkzYQ Columbia Chinese Ollie s makes some fast delicious beef noodle soup Only been here on rare occasions when visiting New York and this is the only thing I order here I can t seem to find any good beef noodle soup places in South Florida sadly either I am blind and or unaware For about 8 it is really good tender meat spicy broth thin noodles and they prepare it really quickly It is a shame that the service here is so terrible though I am not sure why they are so rude and impatient I ve ordered both in Chinese to try and get on the good side and English in case my Chinese was just not good on separate visits and was treated badly anyway and practically ignored during my meal It s frustrating but then again I don t really care much because I get to have some delicious beef noodle soup Overall Ollie s is A OK bad service but a good place to have a really quick meal 
951h81XVB_3vgfwc5X3UQg Columbia American One of the problems of doing your master s part time is that you barely get enough time to hang out with the cool people you meet in your program However sometimes my classmates and I make it a point to hang out because the whole point of going to school is to meet people Right Screw the degree it s all about the people Anyways this week after one of my classes my classmates and I decided to hang out and we came here It is a really large space nice decor and lighting It wasn t too full on a Wednesday night but there was a comfortable buzz We snagged a table by the bar area and decided to get one of their 1 2 price bottles of wine and some appetizers The apps were OK the wine was a nice Chianti and the service was with a smile if a little persistent I think that this might be a good place to come after a long day of work and school A OK 
95fBWSvgbVsSg8bNp2aBUQ Columbia American Ok so I m really not a fan of their breakfast see previous post but their lunch and dinner are really good The soft shell crab sandwich is really really good so is the duck prosciutto sandwich So the food is decent but the service is an embarrassment still 
97qfJ6rqXKbq9ZXPEVpA2Q Columbia American I watched this place developing for a couple of months as I walked to the Cathedral Parkway subway stop every morning so I couldn t wait to try it when it opened But then it opened and I waited to try it something about the idea of preview days that just makes me a little nervous Oh what a mistake I should have gone in the first day and then eaten there every day thereafter for the rest of my life The wine list is short for wines by the glass but perfect The menu is just right seasonal fresh and simple trout with smoked black beans anyone The dessert was exactly the opposite in the best sense complicated creative innovative Whoever is back there whipping up the sweets is doing us all a public service And as the icing on the cake the odds and ends and so much more than odds and ends the cheese selection is absurd and the mac and cheese appetizer was making mac and cheese brand new for me potato pasta maybe Final analysis I love that it s in my neighborhood but this is food that I would travel for regardless 
9A69TFFDDP-QXVKi_S5vIQ Columbia American My wife and I have been going here for years It s definitely one of the better places in the neighborhood and a particularly nice brunch spot The menu selection is respectable and the quality is quite high for bistro food The service can be a bit inconsistent at times but it s generally positive The place tends not to be overrun with undergrads like many nearby on Broadway The burgers are great superb quality and the mussels are wonderful both are reasonably priced with sizable portions I used to be a big fan of the steak frites but they recently changed it from a beef tenderloin cut to a flat iron steak not my favorite Also good are the pasta sausage dish as a dinner entree and the corned beef hash for brunch Some dishes are definitely better than others although there are no bad choices Bistro 1018 is a solid 3 star place I give it 4 stars because it s one of the better options in Morningside Heights 
9aQd2t4-k_B6925jImvFqQ Columbia American NO THANKS In case you were wondering whether or not customer service is a luxury try Radio Perfecto Answer yes My friend and I walked in last night after not seeing each other for quite some time We sit down and wait a bit for service A moderately friendly bartender comes over takes our order and serves us up We were there before 7 and it wasn t too full Around 6 45 people started coming in individually every other minute How do I know Because the door stayed open for a good 30 seconds after each person came in bringing in the crisp December air That was uncomfortable Don t worry discomfort continues A man in a khaki suit eating dinner on his own next to us is watching the game We continue to carry on our conversation and he decides to interject and buy us drinks I said sure but my friend wasn t so up for it Eventually she gave in and the guy tells us to never say no Hmmm that s not what my feminist theory teacher at Columbia taught me but OK moving on It was a sweet gesture yes He continues to watch the game and as I said in the beginning since I have not seen my friend in a while we kept chatting it up No qualms we exchanged thank you s and your weclome s SUDDENLY This one short hipster esque bartender kept giving my friend and I an attitude for the remainder of our stay and I have no idea why And he was deliberately being friendly with everyone else at the bar Could it have been that I asked for an extra dirty martini and he gave me a simple martini and I called him out I just wanted my drink Maybe he thought we were using the guy Except that my friend tried turning down the drink and the guy wasn t trying to talk to us Was it my hair I like other Yelpers and techinically everyone else do not like wasting money and especially not giving it to a jerk I felt completely disrespected and offended by Mr Randy Grinchy Scrooge NO MORE RADIO PERFECTO 
9b05J8aRDUR8bfoNzjTtSQ Columbia American The rice bowl is the freshest healthiest and tastiest menu offering in a 1 2 mile radius Your whole body feels better for it They also have a great breakfast brunch menu The only and main downside to this place is that sometimes the waitstaff is really awkward I ve had to flag them down almost every visit for basic things like salt butter and jam or drinks and a check It gets really annoying like they don t know to follow up on tables But if you can put up with that the food is a pleasure Nice outdoor seating in on Broadway Another downside is that they don t do delivery or carry out Which is a bummer when their staff is awkward But hey like I said oh that heavenly rice bowl 
9F4FkPOw3df8yql-BEDebw Columbia American I love Cafe Bagutta Disregard what the other reviews say about this place not being a spot to relax enjoy tea finish a paper it is definitely that place In fact I was there for about 3 hours one day and ordered a latte one the best I have had in the city by the way and the waiter came over to bring me a cookie on the house because he could tell I was working hard That being said this is definitely not a place for a really quick bite in and out in 20 minutes but for me that is part of the charm If you have a little bit more time and are able to enjoy a nice lunch or coffee this is your place Also their carrot ginger soup and lentil soup are to die for The service is personable and the food is good and well priced Fantastic 
9gJ9wuaa2_IScE3TVyhM4w Columbia American Great place to go for happy hour The beer selection is nice and the specials are usually good The food on the other hand not so nice Stick to normal bar food items and you should be ok 
9HJORQqlAZJrbasSTpZoTg Columbia American We stopped in there on one of the most sweltering August days of the year The A C was blowing and we got a nice table for two and our server was prompt to bring us some ice cold glasses of water They had a delicious chilled apple saucey soup that was very unique and tasty and given the heat we just went with their special salad and a mediterranean plate Prices were reasonable for NYC the atmosphere was very pleasant the service was prompt and professional We ll be sure to go back when they have the fire place going in January of course 
9hJSqaHKk5YrodNUfwSZLg Columbia American Why would a Tavern NOT have wings and pitchers of beers Food is so so staff is a bit pushy and don t let you enjoy your drinks or time beers are expensive and I honestly expected a lot more from them Their menu is super limited and don t offer much Hopefully they ll get it together soon I ll give them another try in the next couple of months stay tuned 
9HYvTposrs6Hd3v7oIn1LQ Columbia Chinese Authentic and delicious northeastern Chinese cuisine There are few things that I enjoy more on brisk fall days than soup and dumplings and the food here hit the spot East Dumpling House knows and executes Chinese noodle and dumpling cuisine very well One thing that sets this place apart from other East Asian restaurants in New York City is that they have selected a specific cuisine sub cuisine even and they stick to it Here you won t find an endless maze of a pan Asian menu that spans the vast diversity of cuisines from different Asian cultures I am always leery of Asian restaurants that serve both pad thai and sashimi there are far too many of these Swiss Army knife Asian restaurants in NYC Not here Instead they stick to the meat and potatoes of China s northeast which you could characterize as wholesome doughy Chinese comfort food The menu features classics such as scallion pancakes pan fried egg and chive dumplings ugly dumpling a wide variety of steamed and pan fried dumplings and a variety of soup noodles and cold noodle dishes we stuck to the dumplings but we ll try some of these others next I m not aware of another place quite like this on the Upper Westside much less one that serves tasty and authentic dumplings so it s a welcome addition to the neighborhood This cuisine is not easy to pull off but this meal impressed us My wife and I shared an order of steamed shrimp and pork dumplings and an order of steamed pork and chive dumplings shuijiao jiaoze pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings guotie and a small order of Shanghai wonton soup This is enough food to feed a table of four but call us ambitious and hungry The filling in each of these dumplings was fresh and delicious consisting of chopped ingredients that are mixed together but distinct In other words no mushy ambiguous globs of mystery meat 1 Steamed shrimp and pork My favorite A generous serving of chopped shrimp ground pork and some vegetables I appreciated being able to distinguish the shrimp from the other ingredients 2 Pork with chives Well done and balanced The chives were not overpowering and the seasoning was perfect My wife thought the meat was a bit too chewy but I liked it 3 Pan fried pork and cabbage Tasty and crispy but a bit unevenly browned The bottoms of some of the pan fried dumplings were dark brown while others were only slightly browned 4 Wonton soup The skin was a bit too thick for wontons but the filling was tasty it featured ground pork and minced vegetables including I believe shiitake mushrooms The steaming broth clear and light tasted like seaweed and a hint of chicken broth Judging from the dumpling skin the dumplings here are probably made very quickly sometimes this leads to dumpling catastrophe with meat and filling rebelling from the flour casing but these dumplings remained intact Columbia students and other Upper Westsiders should flock to this place a rare gem of East Asian cuisine on the Upper Westside The price is right and the food is tasty 
9iSrrVpnbPtwQ6MJOPQjdA Columbia American Nice atmosphere good service tasty food I went here last week for my friend s birthday It was a large party about 15 of friends and family When you enter the establishment there is a full bar on your left and several tables on your right I didn t see much of the place because apparently my friend had reservations or something and we were promptly escorted to a secluded room off to the side The decor in this room was very classy The perimeter of the room was lined with couches There were tables and upholstered stools to match the couches The service was a little slow but not terrible for such a large party and it being a Friday evening I shared a pitcher of Sangria It was very good but you might want to ask for lite fruit similar to requesting lite ice The pitcher was supposed to supply four glasses Due to the fruit is was more like three 3 4 full glasses The waiter noticed our disappointment and brought out another pitcher free of charge Others in my party had alcoholic drinks and said that they were nice and strong As you see from the photos the food presentation was appealing All of the portions from appetizers to entr es were a good size I had the spare ribs and sweet potato fries The ribs were tender and well done I heard no complaints from the others at my table besides being too full to finish their meal No one did dessert The birthday girl s mom brought a cake The food and drinks are not cheap That pitcher of sangria was around 20 and the entr es averaged about 20 25 bucks Of course there s also tax and gratuity applied Not cheap but it is what it is Not the worse I ve seen Harlem real estate IS getting pricey these days I read some of the comments on here before and after I went to Chocolat Maybe I just got lucky because everyone said they enjoyed their time there I would certainly go back I ll just have to save up my pennies first 
9IvJNLfAAenyLSNFbOXsEg Columbia Chinese Cheap fast good chinese relatively speaking 
9MSw4LYWqu3YYLm8TR6vNg Columbia Chinese I give it 3 stars Notable considering that the other Chinese places around here don t even deserve 1 star I ve ordered from them twice now and was impressed that they stored my address from the first time Speedy decent Chinese food Huge portions Tasty gyoza Good dumplings Arrived piping hot in 10 minutes 
9N7jFWb8_QC079zlYGssxg Columbia Chinese I guess if you live up in Harlem Heights you are starved for decent food Ollie s is the best Chinese I ve found willing to deliver North of 140th Street I ve been to the restaurant a couple of times and it is just okay It is a mainstay for delivery despite it s average food If there was one thing that I could recommend it would be the shrimp fried rice the soy beans are a welcome addition I ll be back until something better is found 
9N9IMhlwACFnz78xWwpGSg Columbia American They seem to have slipped a bit in quality lately both food and service wise On a recent evening I had a strip steak that was as tough as shoe leather The heirloom tomato appetizer had tomatoes that were so unripe that they were nearly inedible I sent the dish back without requesting a replacement After the meal we waited so long for the check having asked for it that I finally went inside and buttonholed a different waiter so we could settle up and leave A real downturn compared to my other experiences here 
9nexKsF4fpqf5p3MftGZPw Columbia American While you wouldn t expect a place like this on one of the more raw stretches of Amsterdam Bistro 1018 takes its food and drink very seriously and prices itself accordingly The service is very attentive knowledgeable and usually cute to boot I haven t had a dissapointing meal yet 
9nF-nIonaA_TvLURMl2VJg Columbia American I love Community Food Juice It s closer to me owned by the same people as Clinton St shorter wait times and cheaper Can t get much better Delightful pancakes waffles French Toast served with their special maple butter Always a winning combo This is the only way I trick people into coming up to where I m at to visit and hang out Thank you Community It s one brunch spot I don t have to wake up super early to get to 
9NYxXLRNhwhU2ofE4tDA8w Columbia American squee Both times I ve been there I got that thing that has two eggs bacon and carrot hash browns yeah that s what I said and a biscuit Don t get scrambled eggs Honestly I m in it all for the biscuit which is worth five stars all by its cute little self As soon as your plate comes ask for butter and jam Then split it open put the butter in close it back and don t touch it until you re finished Then with all the butter having melted but the outside still crunchy dump jam on each half Eat the top part first Then cut the bottom in half and give the rest to your gay best friend who is checking out the waiter 
bvn0SmAie27UTSGta08edg Princeton Chinese Okay I m from Jersey Land of big hair and strip malls And generally I get nervous when I visit a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall Especially a restaurant where the patrons seemed to upset the yellow white balance although granted the Indian customers weren t quite white or yellow But man I was impressed by the quality of the food I promised myself I would stop the gorging after this week of gluttony Unfortunately I wasn t expecting such a good meal Especially as I said from a restaurant tucked away in a strip mall next to an Italian restaurant with cheesy Italian opera blaring away But I guess with the Plainsboro population growing they know their Chinese food The tastiness we ordered included Stir fried crab w egg Lotus root with squid Tofu with golden mushrooms Homestyle duck I was busy licking my plate clean My only beef with the place was their rice was dry Not sticky Just dry How do you mess up rice Sad times But still for central Jersey I ll give it a five star rating My taste buds are rejoicing but my stomach is hating me Actually probably more like the scale is hating me right about now Thank goodness for my metabolism 
bX0nrTSp_tcwvuij3ojjCw Princeton American I LOVE this Triumph location I consider it my bar It is a bit small which is usually cozy and warm but can be a bit loud when there is music The staff is super friendly and attentive They often have happy hour specials and small events though the New Hope location is definitely more happening The beer is what draws me in it is DELICIOUS and there is always something new or special to order I rarely come here to eat the portions are small and though creative the dishes leave me unimpressed The fries are great though and the beer more than makes up for what the rest of the menu lacks 
bxrYPCth6hCVYvIwA71VTw Princeton Chinese Don t understand why there s always people there The place is not big There s nothing special about the food I think it taste the same as other Chinese restaurant at the corner Ivy Garden 
by0XSbSFLaLfx-_qQFE5WQ Princeton American While on my travels through Croatia I ate at a seaside restaurant that delivered me terrible service though the food was good The couple next to me started talking to me they guessed I was from NY due to the constant checking of my blackberry in a foreign country and they were right Next thing I know they tell me I should check this joint out I think to myself yeah when am I ever going to be down near Princeton Well a week after returning guess where I find myself For the record it was because of a girl why else right So what did we start with hmm the grilled caesar salad which was served on one piece of lettuce though a large piece and very tasty Salmon tartare was the other starter and was pretty solid as well For the mains we went with the swordfish and the duck risotto The swordfish was cooked well but I thought could ve been seasoned a little stronger The risotto was really good but the duck part was slightly overcooked and thus on the dry side Dessert was grilled peaches with ice cream which was really good Literally a peach cut in half put on the grill and then topped with ice cream So good yet so satisfying Overall I put this spot at 3 5 stars But I m comparing that to what I get to eat everyday in Manhattan so maybe this is a 4 for the area Just be warned it s easy to blow through 200 on a date here so for all you kids on that college budget over there make sure she s worth it 
byJGfIV2-UesqvMOTqdtxw Princeton American OMG I do NOT know how this place is still in business I had a friend visiting from out of town we decided to give the place a try My love for exotic food enticed me in The food really wasn t too bad This is where things got horrible an enormous amount of FLIES circled around the dining room Not one not two but packs Sounds comical but it wasn t Years ago my father owned a diner everyone knows that where there are flies there is spoiled food It was the summer people could say some got in but it wasn t some The server came over and I quote I so sorry for flies we have someone coming in to spray for them ARGHHHHHHH needlessly to say we left as did another group of people This place was not clean I would be afraid to see the kitchen Keep in mind this was the summer of 2009 so perhaps someone came out to spray by then My advice STAY AWAY 
bzqvKeC-Phq3SNPnLI2ECA Princeton American My dinner party sat downstairs in the wine room The food was wonderful I highly recommend the soft shell crab 
C0-6eGAYzuCJp9U9i9y3fw Princeton American I just returned from possibly the best meal I ll ever eat My wife 11 year old daughter and I had dinner at Elements tonight and it was unbelievable First the drinks are inventive and balanced Jamie is working some serious magic behind the bar I had the el Diablo and there s a perfect blend of fruit tequila and just the right amount of spice Loved it However the tasting menu took center stage tonight It started with sea trout three ways and was followed by hazelnut soup with foie gras amazing creamy and the foie gras went so well with the hazelnut Third course was a smoked australian fish can t remember the name now but the blood sausage sauce with it worked perfectly The best part tonight was the Scottish hare which was thinly sliced to perfection and served with homemade tagliatelle hare sausage and some beats The rabbit liver butter which I considered dropping in my pocket for later was heaven in a little ramekin The cheese course that closed out the menu was fun a creamy and ripe local cheese fondue with skewers of bread speck ham and apple My wife and I have been lucky enough to enjoy several occasions in the capable and inventive hands of Scott Anderson and his team I always love how he brings creativity to each dish and he s able to strike a balance between creating his own style while keeping the experience refreshing and unexpected each time I ve had the chance to eat at top restaurants in NYC Philly and DC Tonight Elements outclassed some of my recent trips to Hearth and Prune NYC and America Eats DC And the service here is great From the valet to the servers everyone is polite without being stuffy The wine list has plenty of interesting finds and Justin is always ready with a good recommendation 
C1RLIu2bnMd5JY7VfKcR-w Princeton American Fancy fancy fancy french Love this food so delectable Need to be dignified and whatnot everyone speaks quietly 
C4aePX5xjPje_Ms7KSsgjg Princeton American One of the better Houlihan s I know chains are supposed to be the same but you and I both know that s not true No matter where you go the mgr the staff the bartenders etc make a difference With that in mind this Houlihan s seems to work better than the one on Rt 18 and the one on Rt 22 Drinks seem to come out faster the food comes out hotter etc than at the others Also love the fact that it s open so late I fly alot and find my self at PHL at midnight more times than I care to think about I can still get to Houlihan s and get food bar menu only and drink until 1 55am Love it 
C4nP0TnjwTMdj1QGNnXKRQ Princeton American I ve been to the Salt Creek Grill 3 times and all 3 times the food and the service have been subpar I can overlook service if the food is good but the food is definitely not good I ve ordered three different items each time thinking maybe they just had an off night but this was not the case It s a shame too because this place has good ambiance minus the terrible acoustics and blasting live music from the bar area and the menu makes sense There s a good reason why this place gets so many bad reviews the food is not good and that being said it makes the prices even harder to swallow I offer two pieces of advice 1 Get rid of ALL kitchen staff and start over by hiring a new head chef An excellent chef would never allow ill prepared food to leave his her kitchen If you want to put high prices on your menu you need a chef who can execute the orders Period 2 The live music in the bar area good idea because people like live music but this music is not contained in this area as the acoustics are terrible here and spills over into the dining area to the point where you have to shout yes literally shout it s that loud across the table as if you re at a club After 10 pm fine but during dinner hours no this is not acceptable Either turn down the amps or tell these guys to show up at 10 pm 
c6SmcCskMxbVT0hbxIbRXw Princeton Chinese Located in the front of an enormous shopping center this restaurant has the availability of hundreds of people who march in and out in flocks before and after their shopping extravaganzas As my friend and I walked in we were told of the 45 minute wait for a table so we scurried to the bar in hopes to find two adjacent seats Luckily we did The food was of course superb I started with the egg drop soup a nice classic that never fails here I moved on to the beef lo mein which wasn t greasy or over seasoned The portion was more than adequate but not Cheesecake Factory sized thank god I finished off with the banana spring rolls which weren t as aesthetically pleasing as the other courses but overwhelmed my senses with delicious flavors that contrasted its appearances The main thing that I noticed in this PF Chang s compared to others was that I felt like I was in a herd of animals being ushered in to quickly eat from the trough and then leave in one mass together When I go out to dinner 3 things matter like they do for most people 1 The atmosphere is nice PF Chang s CHECK 2 The food intensely delicious PF Chang s CHECK 3 I can take the time to enjoy myself rather than not being able to remember the experience PF Chang s FAIL I was able to have great conversations with my friend which reminded me that I had little to no conversation with the bartender minus the ordering of our items The poor gentleman had barely a chance to breathe let alone speak to his guests to form any rapport whatsoever Overall I still love PF Chang s as I always have Just not this one 
C7FFcV5UVn4UXzrilGLUSw Princeton American Go for the drinks and the atmosphere but skip the food The hummus was too spicy the kabobs were like rubber and the fish with the fish and chips was a really small portion 
c7hwTj7dEYvlLm0PTfRixg Princeton American Sunday Brunch Food and service was good Everyone from the Maitre d to the server were very accomodating The sweet potato spread was delicious on enquiry they even gave us some to take home Very good vegetarian options 
C7IrDDe-H7evm0V5tpfL3w Princeton American Mexi fusion One of the best meals I have ever had A client hosted me and a colleague my really nice boss to dinner at the Ferry House and it was truly exceptional The three of us started with their signature Lump Crab Margarita It is a huge handful of lump crab mixed with avocado scallions and a oli with Old Bay on the rim of a Margarita glass A couple tortilla chips to shovel all this crab on your fork Just damn good I enjoyed crab stuffed Mahi Mahi atop garlic mash potatoes and asparagus Mussels and clams surrounded this pile of goodness My host knocked down Jumbo Prawns and Seared Sea Scallops panned fried in with Cherry Tomato Butter My boss ordered Salmon set on Crab Crusted Portobello Mushroom French Bean fired in a Red Beet Saute A Pecan Tort with homemade coffee ice cream was all mine Perhaps you can call the service slow but I d rather think of it as pacing a great meal to enjoy 
CA5H3wkuH2U4WZJ6nEsNbw Princeton Chinese This is my favorite buffet place in the Princeton area They have a good variety of food and the food is more authentic than place like PF Chang The person who complained about the sugary goo well what does walnut and shrimp is suppose to taste like The people who complain does not know what Chinese food is suppose to be Come on American people go to PF Chang and Tiger Noodle When you look in look at what kind of people are in there There are a lot of Asian there So think people More Asian good Chinese food And who goes to PF Chang and Tiger Noodle Enough said One thing I do not eat the American food there and I would not eat the dim sum section It s just a waste of time They have Peking Duck there you re not going to find this in PF Chang Tiger Noodle and yes Peking Duck is very greasy 
CAmdiWhlzdik5JOIDyzXCA Princeton American Elements is the only gourmet restaurant that I know of in Princeton There are many restaurants with good food but if you are looking for white tablecloth attentive service a complimentary welcome bite from the kitchen solid wine card elegance and upscale feel this is the place to go The charcuterie platter appetizer was excellent and the venison was really good too but could perhaps had a bit more interesting sides garniture With a glass of wine it was a very nice meal It s not cheap but I think you get what you pay for I was torn between 4 and 5 stars but service was impeccable so I m rounding up 
caZjjmbozlQyY8J9492Ujg Princeton Chinese If you re looking for Americanized Chinese food I guess here s the place to go It caters to the working white professionals in the Plainsboro area so lunchtime can get pretty busy The food isn t bad really Just not quite authentic It s found its nice niche in the palates of the American suburbanites so hasn t quite tried to deviate from the niche It s still thankfully a step up from Karen s restaurant in Princeton but definitely nothing exciting Beating Karen s btw is a feat that doesn t require much bragging rights They have a little lunch buffet on weekdays again for the lunching professionals Dishes are simple lo mein potstickers shrimp in lobster sauce All a little bit greasy and a little cold I prefer the lunch specials that come with soup and rice The steamed fish was surprisingly good and simple with a large portion for the price Perhaps the one standout It s been a while since I ve been there for dinner but from what I can remember the dishes were more of the same American Chinese cuisine Not bad tasting but a little heavy on the oil and the western modifications 
CbcOcP-Qgljp8yLMv1DZOg Princeton Chinese I grew up in Princeton Junction and Lotus Garden is the best and most authentic Chinese restaurant in the area The service is always friendly and the food is terrific My favorite is the spicy beef with dry bean curd I don t even like tofu but they have perfected this dish It s one of my all time favorites I would eat there every day if only I didn t move out and live close to Chinatown in NY I would say Lotus Garden would be able to hold its own on Canal Street 
CBxNRtnwh-RT42vhniUZcQ Princeton American I dined at Pure tonight and left with mixed feelings The staff were all very nice courteous attentive some of them even fun and cheerful The food and drinks were overpriced for the quality and portions Fried curry oysters all 5 were tasty but very fried tasting All of their salads sounded tasty the confit with duck leg thigh salad was quite good and I was pleased with the serving size We ordered the 40 chef s choice and got 5 pcs sushi an Alaska roll tuna yellowtail salmon red snapper sashimi The fish was fresh Considering what we had already spent on a small sake and some wine nothing on the dessert menu intrigued us enough to buy it Our meal in general tasted good but left us feeling like something was missing The emphasis is definitely on image at this place though some of the wait staff were a bit awkward I would recommend this place to a friend but I ll probably not go back I can spend the same amount elsewhere and get twice as much food but of course I wouldn t be sitting on a shiny gold chair in a pool of red light coming down from a massive chandelier 
ccoMYd8ab35eko40cqd5Ng Princeton Chinese The dimsum on the weekend is awesome Within a 30 mile radius of Princeton I don t think any other restaurant every comes close I use to come here every other week or so when I lived in Princeton Even now when I go back I would always go to Shanghai Park to try their dim sum Two of my friends had their wedding banquet here and they got the chefs here to cook an awesome 10 course meal none of which appears on the menu The regular menu is pretty good too A shanghai friend tells me that the food there is pretty authentic but you need to know what to order The braised fish stomach is really good and so is the yellow chives with beef Another one of my favorites is cilantro beef soup 
CE3iao6XmtXhXcNXkADd0A Princeton Chinese The food is awesome I always come here with my family This is one of the best Chinese restaurant in central NJ They have just started the delivery service So now I can enjoy their tasty food at home 
CeNT-phbOqYUL5sUhKNVIQ Princeton Chinese Best Chinese Ever I can t believe there are bad reviews on here I have been going to Tiger Noodles since I was 4 or 5 years old and it has just gotten better The people who work there are great the food is amazing and I live in NY now try and find better steamed veggie dumplings I double dog dare you and now that they have expanded there are more seating options Eating outside in the summer Nothing better Cold sesame noodles and chicken moo shoo are YUM Wonton soup Perfect If you could marry chinese food I would do it here Seriously Yelpers This place is awesome 
ceXGzIgetDpvCjOIPMjmLQ Princeton American Is the NJ monthly a reputable source to rate the best burgers of NJ Well the latest poll from their article showed that this joint has the 4th best burger in NJ 3rd in Central NJ but 1st in the Princeton Skillman area With that standing why not give it a try right We arrived as a party of 4 after a game of tennis unchanged from our sweaty attire and were slightly surprised they still seated us Maybe because it was a Wednesday night maybe the establishment doesn t have a dress code but either way it worked out well for us We all ordered a beer and its award winning burger while here Although it was a decent burger it didn t live up to my expectations of what I expected I like eggs on my burger and I wish more people who offer that as an option when serving gourmet burgers The bacon was supposedly applewood smoked But I didn t really taste the applewood flavor even when I ate my bacon independently of the burger to taste for it In the end it was a filling gourmet bacon burger with an egg on top which is not a novel concept Not a failed first time experience at the inn but it didn t engage me to return anytime soon 
CiAbyDFgsC6i4LHeT0SPzA Princeton American Me and my boyfriend had lunch here today and by far the best Advocado and Cucumber Rolls we have ever tasted The freshness in the vegetables was there you can taste it The customer service was very polite and gentle and the ambiance is so awesome it almost had me not wanting to leave Highly recommend it 
cIDhZOyY8X23DMAY8zI39g Princeton American I ve been to Salt Creek Grille a number of times in the last month The decor is great it looks like a ski lodge as others have commented I especially like the fireplace Food is good although overpriced they have a prix fixe menu that includes soup salad a choice of 3 entrees and a chef s choice desert While it is nothing exciting I like the house salad it includes yummy candied walnuts Service is very attentive the last time I was there my friend s meal wasn t prepared to order and they fixed it quickly and gave him a genuine apology The big downside of this restaurant is the acoustics it can be really loud 
CIiTPxFVzz4Jclar0Fw0bQ Princeton American After waiting a significantly long time we finally got in on our reservation at nine o clock at night I forgave because apparently some party group threw of the reservation schedule by arriving an hour late The food was pretty good Some sort of soy sauce sweet and sour calamari to start and a chicken and shrimp dish as my entree Good stuff Kinda pricey though but maybe it s just my grumpiness weighing my rating down 
ciKFh33TzuL5jtHRghUsjw Princeton American I have been to this place several times now and every time has been worse than the last Tonight marks the end I will never return to Triumph We ordered a Scallop Po Boy and the Epic Burger The po boy was disgusting Was that a roasted tomato or pepper I think I deserve to know It s rude to serve something unidentifiable for more than 10 And now the fiance is reminding that the scallops of this Scallop Po Boy were nowhere to be seen There was something fried in there but a scallop I don t know As for this Epic burger Yuck It looked like many items I ve seen on thisiswhyyourefat com It was just a mess of monochrome meat and onions Totally unappetizing to look at totally disgusting to eat I am getting indigestion just thinking about it Also Triumph smells like pea soup and cleaning fluid I lose my appetite when I walk in the door I kind of wish I could give it zero stars but I think they deserve one star for featuring Elina Lorenz s art Good job Triumph but you still need to learn how to cook 
CivGXkXwmbGAUnZ23CP-EA Princeton American The food here was pretty good and I would definitely eat there again The menu items seemed a bit expensive for what they were The only reason we tried it was because we had a very nice gift certificate which made it totally worth it The service was very good once we got seated At the bar and the host table the service was not memorable We started with teh SCG Chips which were outstanding Probably the best part of our meal We also got the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer which was pretty good I then had the Porterhouse Stroganoff and my fiancee had the filet The entrees were good but not outstanding Finally for dessert we got creme brulee which was standard and very good It was good but not great and a bit too pricey for what it is Like I said before we had a very generous gift card 
ci_9NJ5GefI8IiiqvgIAXA Princeton American This is a gem that locals like we are who commute to NYC where there are many fine dining opportunities appreciate for the quiet elegance and delicious food The service is prompt from the Maitre to table service mature fun and friendly After a long week of slogging it at work etc this is a great estuary to enjoy your dining company ambience food and drink The One 53 Martini will set you off in the right direction Good for mature well behaved kids rowdies please go down the street to the Tiger Tale 
ckwScHxB5Lqc5yHHiBavxQ Princeton American This is my second visit to Salt Creek Grill The first time I have to say I was not a fan The atmosphere was very loud and the food was average I was back July 19 2010 I have to say it was a much better experience I had a gift card so I was ready It was 1 2 price bottle of wine great deal and a good variety We had the calamari app It was cooked very well and tasty The meals we also cooked well and quite tasty The atmosphere is still a bit loud 
cM-sLJq-2NMeLOePmqHvVg Princeton Chinese Decent to good food at fair prices but rude service from the phone inquiry to the check This is not the first time we ve experienced such service here of course it pretty much ruins the meal Marginally better when it was called Great Wall but it s gotten worse Would thus recommend for takeout or emergencies only 
CnQ-wTSpoZ87ZpIOGoqmUQ Princeton American The cheesecake and food are good but be prepared to wait Do not go here for a work lunch It will take over an hour 
CPcjmnfMqAkx8Tm1Fmfr7w Princeton Chinese There is one dish in particular that I have at least 1 2 times a week Being a meat eater I surprise myself in telling you that it s the Bean Curd with Broccoli dish It s simple clean DELICIOUS It is prepared the same way every single time I order it no variations no experimentation This dish is usually served for dinner only the portion size is generous You can order it for lunch but they will tell you that it will be dinner size at the dinner price which is around 8 Remember the Sex The City episode where Miranda orders her usual Chinese take out and the woman on the other end laughs and says I know you Well that s exactly what it s like here and that s fine by me 
cpkWeUspkE3JPB4aRejyjQ Princeton American Awesome atmosphere with a lofty feel Burgers are really really good and the chipotle aoli for the fries is great I ve been here probably a dozen times and the beers are good but I ve never really been blown away by any of them I actually had to send back a barleywine one time because it tasted exactly like Robitussin Their standard session ales are usually spot on though 
CpTDS9ru8eCMUojfENnkAQ Princeton American What a great place The food is superb and there is a very nice selection of reasonably priced wines plus some very very good wines I liked the casual friendly environment which added to the ambiance The wine cellar is a special treat for dinner There is nothing better than attending a wine tasting with Jeff the manager and sommelier and then having dinner 
CqRRdyQHj6fIULw7lZBV6A Princeton American I wish I had read the recent reviews because they are spot on This restaurant is horrific I live in Manhattan and serendipitously found out about elements through another restaurant at which I like to eat in another city Atelier Crenn I was surprised I had never heard of this restaurant or this chef considering the amount I eat out and read about restaurants so I very much wanted to try it thinking this may be a gem in the middle of nowhere a la Blue Hill at Stone Barns I called and made a reservation through Beth at the chef s table for their 9 course tasting I was told the chef would probably pull out all the stops given how I found out about the restaurant I asked how many seats were at the chef s table and I was told 10 I asked how many others would be at the table and I was told I was the only one It was a Tuesday night so I thought super at least I won t have to compete with others for the staff s attention Boy was I wrong Incidentally this is not a chef s table this is a set of three tables in an open room adjacent to the kitchen The tasting started fine with three fairly crappy amuses The first was what looked like a rock it was a croquette When you cut into it stringy goo came out The next amuse was a sashimi fish dish that actually smelled like fish and tasted old and unhealthy That should have been my first clue as to how the night was going to go but I am an optimist at heart and tried to remain positive After three amuses course after course of absolutely unimpressive food was delivered although one tomato dish was intriguing and decent Some dishes had too much heat some weren t seasoned enough some had so much food I felt like I was going to explode it was mostly bland The octopus was chewy and dry he wagyu beef chewy Very few people came around to see how I was doing including the chef who is an arrogant troll This restaurant is riddled with stunning arrogance from the chef down to the runners Normally great chefs visit the dining room to see how things are going and to explain parts of the meal Especially during a tasting I have had access to some of the country s best chefs except for Scott Anderson whom I almost mistook for a bus boy if someone had not pointed him out as the chef Do not be seduced by the photos on his website which is what motivated me to spend 4 hours in the car driving from Manhattan to Princeton roundtrip and spend more than 50 in gas and tolls I can assure you not one person cared that I went to such extremes to eat this cook s food except two people Amy the manager who has three star poise and Alliana spelling a food runner who also demonstrated poise and professionalism They were the two individuals who are fish out of water here their service level was so high it belongs in a proper Michelin starred restaurant which elements will never become All others were rookies poorly trained knew nothing about the food were stupid arrogant dumbasses and didn t know how to interact with human beings You cannot retrain people who have not had proper role models in their parents They are irreparably broken Here is where the fun starts As the night wore on I became so bored with this pathetic food that I began to lean back in my chair it wasn t an especially attractive or fragile chair Then an insolent kid arrogantly comes over to tell me to stop leaning back in my chair JUST before my last course I was almost out of there Now if someone says it politely you apologize profusely but when someone comes over and demands that you stop leaning in a chair at a restaurant of this supposed caliber well let s just say a shouting match ensued I demanded my check in between f bombs didn t finish my last course and left Before I did Scott Anderson came over to defend his lad asking me not to call him an a hole I thought he was coming to apologize like most normal restaurants would do I told him he was an a hole and deserved to be called one Nevertheless I tipped 20 even though I wanted to leave nothing for two reasons because there were a few people that didn t make my night bad and who tried and so that the people who were rude to me can wear it as a badge of shame knowing they didn t deserve it and that the others carried them This restaurant is an imposter masquerading as a new american restaurant I have already warned all of my Princeton friends Shame on you Scott Anderson for running a terrible restaurant with staff equally as terrible You should all be ashamed of yourselves for having no standards 
crf2qwVjdhtnrk54-IRkLA Princeton American MMM BEERS had a very nice ale there it was good food very good had the prime philly steak sandwich very much worth it and very lagre in size staff friendly and sharp gh 
cT1QQ8FpChbjKWrile1oiA Princeton Chinese Not a very clean or cozy place but decent food The acoustics suck There was a table of girls laughing it up and the sound was so amplified we couldn t hear each other 
CTcpAwviywoXWcBqEYYa4g Princeton American 2nd time here with 7 friends Last time I ever come back too this sh box My friends agree If I could give this place a negative rating I would 3 hours slow service done Wasted enough time at this place On a Saturday evening where this place should be packed and I may understand 3 hour service but the place was half empty lol I think people are catching on and found a better spot to dine Good riddances Calamari was more like a soup bleh Tilapia was my main and it was good Had some chocolate cake and the pecan pie both horribad Chocolate cake tasted like a melted hersey s bar and the pecan s in the pie were so grounded up all you tasted was sugar and crust bleh oh and I didnt realize how bad the little flies were I read other reviews and lol Come on guys how do you have flies everywhere inside you guys have a dead body in the basement They were annoying horrible Place 
CtEgh4rY1IAWS_17behh1g Princeton Chinese A good place to go on a second date especially if it s not too crowded The ambiance is quite lovely it s dark and romantic The drinks are excellent The first thing you have to know about the food is that EVERYTHING is frozen and shipped to the individual restaurants nothing is actually created on premises This explains the small and uniform portion sizes Once I found this out I lost most of my interest in coming here That said some of the noodle dishes are sort of yummy The service is normally very good although during one memorable negative visit there was this large family sitting in a corner that was letting their 2 young children run amok throughout the entire restaurant and NOBODY asked them to control their children At one point the kids tried to crawl under our table and I m pretty sure I scared them into submission with some well placed Anglo Saxon phrases That alone was enough to not really make me want to come back very often That said it s definitely something you should experience once For a repeat experience I d recommend Sunny Garden a few blocks over 
c_1fyDbRiYNPjurN8yPArA Princeton American The Ferry House is an excellent choice for a date night or a celebratory dinner The atmosphere is nice and the food is excellent The Ferry House was pleased to accomodate this vegetarian with a risotto sampler which was much appreciated as there are no vegetarian items listed on the menu Prices are high but again the food is very good 
d0GKB2GEkWiW4j0_6a1A5Q Princeton American I must say I was impressed by this place Not so much the service that was par but the beers and foodstuff were great My table ordere a few beers while we waited to be seated each sampled one of the microbrews and they were all really good I particularly enjoyed the Imperial Stout though like most stouts I probably wouldn t be able to drink more than one of those without feeling full French Onion Soup good cheese bread soup ratio though the broth was super salty Hummus Plate I liked that they had a spicey relish on top gave it a good kick Hangar Steak subbed salad for shoestring fries steak cooked perfectly and the salad had figs and goat cheese Delicious but I bet those parmesean fries would have been fantastic too Overall a good time good atmosphere too Will probably make another trip back and order the beer sampler 
D0msSHPfPIlA3ANhAaI78A Princeton Chinese Overall good experience for a pricy chain Kids liked it which is a big plus for us always 
D1vqcEqLYfiGA99v8EMygQ Princeton Chinese The scope of this review is very narrow This is only for take out and for their beef noodle soup The person who took my order looked like the owner and was friendly Always had a smile Hmmm It seemed that he was the only one there who was smiling Anyways It s hard to get good beef noodle soup in the area After you have the ones from Taiwan nothing really seems to compare The beef noodle soup here has a way to go but still pretty good Soup was flavorful I asked them to add small spicy and it turned out just right Beef was good and tender Was hoping for more tendon though They used udon noodles Personal choice but I would like the noodles to be thinner Price is a tad on the high side with 9 and change for just the beef noodle soup Even though it s pricey Yay I m a fan until something better comes along 
d2pXTeJIguLMGWQWPxLk3A Princeton Chinese I was ready to bash this place with a 1 star review due to the fact that it took over 2 hours and 20 minutes to receive the small delivery I gave them a call at the 2 hr mark and was told the delivery guy is on the way It was a Sunday night therefore the it s busy excuse was not a good one Once arrived I made sure to check that food is hot and does not look re heated Delivery guy apologized and quickly accepted my request for a discount and gave me 2 off of 16 don t hate me I did give him a 25 tip Since the food was fresh and the delivery guy was nice I will give them the benefit of the doubt and rate the food objectively Ming s Garden did exceed my expectations as the Princeton area lacks decent Chinese food for the most part Though not good enough to warrant 4 stars the price was right and the food is solid The cold sesame noodles a simple dish was pre mixed with above average noodles Chinese Curry Chicken generally tends to be quite bland but Ming s version of it had a pleasant kick to it with properly sauteed crisp vegetables Heavy on the onion but still superior to many places around here Finally the Beef Chow Mein was an interesting experience as it lacked noodles My significant other had mentioned this is sometimes the case but I made sure that the description contained white rice fried noodles before ordering Though it was borderline mushy the rest of the dish did beat my expectations while missing the noodle part If I were able to I d rate Ming s Garden 3 and 1 2 stars the food was solid and I ve paid too much for far worse Chinese in the area Worthy of a re visit if I am in the mood 
d6MeMXjkrTb1qsF1Lj9hww Princeton American Unfortunately the Ferry House lives up to the stereotype of Princeton restaurants over priced and underwhelming Although the staff was attentive the ceviche appetizer was unoriginal the duck entree was tough and the chocolate dessert that tried to be innovative was dry and flavorless Go elsewhere 
DAPBo6sh_sstohVUz0yS8Q Princeton Chinese Man the place was packed on a Thursday at 12 30pm Not sure being on St Pattie s Day and the first day of the NCAA adds how many standard deviations to the norm We had to take the last two spots by the bar counter Ordered the Calamari Mongolian Beef and Orange Shrimp from the pre fix Food is consistently a little heavy in both taste and look This is definitely not a place for either fresh catch from the tank or thousand year old egg 
dDBhec6N9MloncWnY96CDA Princeton American Considering that my flower shop provides the flowers for Underground Kevin and I have never eaten here We had heard the food was very good and was highly rated and we were not disappointed The atmosphere was very nice and comfortable Our server was attentive and amazed us with her ability to tell us about all the night specials four very involved meals I had the stuffed pepper which were not only tasty but quite filling Kevin had the lamb special that was also wonderful In honor of their 4 year anniversary they treated all of us to a wonderful starter that consisted of 4 different appetizers That was especially wonderful especially the stuffed mushroom and the spinach crouquets Because we wanted to try a dessert that was unique we tried their Bulgarian bread pudding That was very nice and the perfect ending to a very pleasant meal I see the reviews are rather mixed but we really enjoyed our meal 
devNDHjoulv8DkCAS40hWQ Princeton American April 1 2011 First time at Elements in Princeton My SO and I went on a Friday night so the dining room was pretty full The pictures online were deceiving as the space is relatively small however it never felt cramped or crowded We were a bit close to the tables around us which provided for some entertaining eavesdropping especially as the wine got flowing We both ordered the tasting menus with wine pairings as part of the Foodie Fridays feature There were 5 courses with 2 additional from the chef bites The early courses were good but nothing outrageous I could have done without the Uni and geoduck as it wasn t quite what my palate was wanting at the time Once we got to the substantial courses the chef began to shine The sea bass was very very good I actually don t remember how it was prepared but I don t recall it being anything complicated just good Next was a geoduck linguine with broccoli which was quite good once I mixed it up A lot of the pieces of goodness sank to the bottom of the dish and weren t well integrated with the pasta so my first couple bites were bland Then came the partridge which once we got past the immature entertainment of the claw being still attached and quietly singing C mon Get Happy was excellent Yes we were enjoying the libations I have never had partridge but I likened it to turkey but better than the best turkey I have ever had The cheese course came out and the waitress was oddly hesitant I know why now The cheese was overly smokey and neither of us really liked it at all This was disappointing considering I really like artisan cheeses The great part was the waitress acknowledged that it is a cheese that only certain people like so she offered us any dessert in place on the house We looked at the menu and decided to each get a dessert as we couldn t agree on one to split Both were outstanding To top it all they actually comped us for both desserts Totally unsolicited and unnecessary but very gracious I must say also that the wine pairings throughout were perfect During one course which I don t quite recall the wine they brought before I didn t like at all on its own and neither did my girlfriend However being a pairing menu veteran I tried it with the dish and wow it was not only tolerable but was a great complement and ended up finishing the glass I will definitely return to Elements as often as my wallet will allow and look forward to see how the tasting menu changes with the seasons 
dG5zPTAEF4RYdB8q_Ned6g Princeton American Nice chic bar restaurant on Naussau right across the street from Princeton The ambience was lively but unfortunately we got seated in a section that seemed private at first but ended up being the loudest and most obnoxious part of the entire restaurant due to a group of 15 loud drunk idiots The food quality was average at best but they did have a unique selection of dinner items which included chicken lolliops deep fried pickles salmon pastrami and moules frites It was a fun place to go and would have been a better experience if not for our new friends seated next to us The layout of the place was pretty cool especially the long hallway as you step inside the restaurant 
dGOYibeGsTAZ2D8kjw-DgA Princeton Chinese Being a Princeton University employee I have had many chances to eat all around Princeton Usually for lunch we go to the Ivy Garden when we want Chinese however the other day Ivy Garden was closed during our lunch We decided to venture down to Tiger Noodles I was very disappointed by the food there I ordered the General Tso s which just tasted like fried chicken drenched in Tabasco Hot Sauce The portions were smaller than the Ivy Garden and the service was no where near as friendly In my opinion if you are in Princeton and you want Chinese go 2 blocks closer to campus for the Ivy Garden 
dhByNWLZrnqIzY-ePmNkeg Princeton American I ve eaten here a few times and the food is delicious I always order the sausage shish kabobs and I ve not been disappointed Even the white rice is delicious lol there s something deliciously different about it I can t put my finger on what it is though Try Underground you won t be disappointed 
Dj4GDy1ziFzNibIrPgfh9g Princeton American I can t say enough good things about Ferry House We had a phenomenal dinner a few weeks ago we haven t stopped talking about it The service was wonderful the food was out of sight We split the bisque the crab margarita appetizers Due to my tomato allergy I couldn t have their guacamole at the bottom of the margarita so they gave me a double serving of crab It was delicious Foodie Boyfriend loved his venison shrimp entree my mahi mahi was perfectly prepared Bring a fabulous bottle of wine to match their incredible food Now that we re back in LA we regret that we didn t go back for a second night 
dk8WFkgi77T4Oz3TvK-Nfg Princeton American Not a bad place We stopped in for lunch and sat at the bar The 3 courses for 15 is a deal We came at noon and it wasn t packed The decor and ambiance are 5 Stars The food is good but didn t wow me then again it was lunch The service was good I will be back to try dinner 
dPd96bv0XPYXiOMNv_586A Princeton American I went back again with another LivingSocial voucher and had another great meal without any hassle Very good service and delicious food 
DPU4Tu2OSNWon5e7qhHGKA Princeton American Triumph is quite a good brewpub really I have been coming here for 10 years and recently returned after a long hiatus I ve tried many brewpubs across the land Triumph s selections are still quite impressive Part of the reason for this may be a lack of adventurism The beer selection is generally the same with one or two seasonal beers Most brewpubs will do more tinkering but I suppose that Triumph has perfected their standbys The food is fine though I certainly wouldn t come here just to eat Also it can be hard to have a meal in the bar area as the tables are a bit cramped 
DsVqLCj8XD4h-70KfIWU7w Princeton Chinese Decent enough takeot for Princeton although if you re looking for a sit down place I would definitely head 3 stores down to Sushi Palace instead That being said this is a solid option if you are looking for a quick inexpensive meal to go The pepper steak is nicely seasoned and pretty tender and the garlic chicken is enerously portioned A step up from the Ivy Garden for sure And it s cheaper too 
DTDVtrHVQ5km2fBP13NVIQ Princeton American Elements opened in Princeton a few months ago and ever since then I have wanted to check it out After 1 cancelled reservation a few weeks ago thanks to my wife we finally went yesterday night We got to the restaurant right on time however there wasn t any parking available and no valet parking either We ended up parking in the lot of a bank about a block away even that only had 2 parking spots left It was a freezing night and only got worse by the end of dinner Boy was I shivering when I got back into the car We walk into the restaurant and find the hostess stand just next to an amazingly small bar I think it could only hold about 3 guests Things seemed a little chaotic Our hostess wasn t there and than 3 different people asked if we were being helped I think one of them was the hostess We got to our table which had no cutlery whatsoever just napkins But this is planned they bring out a fresh set with every course We were approached with the drinks menu by someone who I thought was our waiter but he wasn t A waitress came to take our drink orders she was our waitress I think chaotic service is good word for Elements They have a lot of staff floating around all in an attempt to provide good service but it comes across as chaotic Every course was delivered by a different person usually the same person delivers all your food at most restaurants Despite the chaos it doesn t detract from the food whatsoever which is very good The restaurant itself is pretty nicely decorated in muted earth tones However the lighting is a little on the low side I personally would have liked to have had a little more light to admire the unsmiling attractive waitress who seemed to be jetting back and forth in front of our table all night long Ok it s all about the food and the food save the desserts is very good For the 1st course we had the handmade farfalle which came with broccoli rabe sausage and rock shrimp This was an excellent dish Very flavorful very well balanced and the sausage was amazing I had the pork belly Pork belly is my new favorite thing I was in Dallas last week and had the most amazing pork belly ever from The French Room at The Adolphus This has become the pork belly standard The pork belly at Elements was very good just not as good as The French Room My guess is that if I had not eaten that version I would have liked this even more For the main course we had the black bass in thai curry This was a very good dish too The fish was perfectly cooked and the spices and flavors were perfectly balanced just a little short on salt I had the 48 hour short rib which in a word was fabulous I love short rib and this is the very best version I have ever had It reminded me of an excellent kobe steak perfectly cooked just the right amount of fat amazingly tender beautifully flavored This is a dish to die for For dessert we had the jelly doughnut and chocolate with salty caramel Desserts are ok nothing really to rave about The doughnut itself was very good the jelly was just too tart The chocolate made me think of a brownie not the brioche it was supposed to be and a little salty for me I am very sensitive to salt in food For drinks we had the dirty lychee martini and I had a glass of temparillo which was excellent I wish the wines by the glass list was a little longer Overall great food a very welcome addition to the Princeton restaurant scene which really needs better restaurants I have moaned about the lack of decent restuarants in Princeton foreever it s a crime but things are slowly changing Having a restaurant like Elements will hopefully force other restaurants to push the the creativelity and taste envelope www foodielifestyle com 
dthcy2rvkkYevGnd998ZNA Princeton American Went for the 1st time today I think you nice folks giving this place 2 stars or less either don t have taste buds or consider the cost of McDonald s a huge night out I had the romaine caeser salad and the fish tacos Both were above average The fish tacos themselves were great The rice and beans that came with it were bland Bland dropped this to a 3 star from a 4 1 star No 2 stars Debatable but no Service was very good Ambiance was solid I ll be back and will probably question the taste buds of the 2 star folks again 
DTteRkAyQ7cprAMm7hEHJg Princeton Chinese What a disgrace to Chinese people everywhere My last experience with Tiger Noodles is just that my last Terrible rude service Sent us the wrong food and acted as if it was OUR fault My duck soup didn t have roasted duck as in bone in skin on variety It was cut into julienne strips i m assuming so it can be rendered as dry as possible for the person trying to eat it Flavorless I don t know what the other reviewers are smoking 
DuPJAOzbcHwg0Ixe97ykzg Princeton American Excellent seafood Prices are better than other Princeton restaurants not because they are cheaper but because the quality of food and taste is worth it compared to others Ahi tuna is always prefect The crab margarita is to die for fresh lumps of crab meat spices avocado served in a margarita glass not a drink The creme brulee is an award winner The atmosphere is kind of uptight The dining area is very dark There is no outside seating 
dWeJEZNimsjvfyRRrcsXcA Princeton American I wasn t going to bother writing this place up since I m rarely in Princeton NJ but felt my experience should be known The place itself is a huge cavern vaulted ceiling with a nod to the western style lodges in National Parks and Rocky Mountain enclaves It definitely feels impressive when you first walk in past the semi outdoor fireplace We immediately got a table in the main dining room on a Saturday night but our conversation was brief between the rocking band playing soul and R B covers for the bar crowd at a decibel non conducive to casual dining The place was pricey but to be expected if you re serving really tasty food I wasn t super hungry and opted for the wild mushroom burger 12 so I could get a lobster bisque soup 8 and still be in a reasonable price zone Many appetizers were at 15 The recommended double cut pork chop entree was 25 and steaks were hovering around 34 I also was not drinking so I can t comment on alcohol prices Most of the wine selection was from the California corporate vineyards like Ravenswood or Mondavi etc The table ordered a calamari appetizer which was ok but the breading was falling off and a little underdone in the deep fryer My bisque arrived and it was fishy tasting Not delicious lobster fishy tasting A little overwhelming fishy tasting and I kind of knew what we were getting into then My burger arrived and it was cooked correctly but it was dry and not juicy It kind of fell apart in squares around the edges The potato roll bun was a bit hard and glazed but not in a crusty way And there really wasn t any mushrooms It was mostly these oil soggy caramelized onions on the topping and the tomatoes were super hard In short it was really really expensive diner food And I ve been to diners that do it better for a third of the price And I feel bad saying that because the space itself was pretty cool in that modern lodge kind of way I wasn t expecting the greatest food ever but I was expecting a tasty burger I guess if you re charging these prices you would expect something better than food service style cafeteria quality and something locally purveyed But then I found out it s a chain So there you go Others at the table were pleased with the fish sole and the pork chop While the steak sandwich and two burgers were squarely dismissed The rating is really food based The service was fine and I m sure it s an okay place for a drink but I can t look past my dreadful meal for that price The service and environment get a star 
dytgGmFB9m9PHLfJaalsLA Princeton Chinese The GOOD it s a nice dining room and the circular tables with the Lazy Susan are good for big groups The waiters are nice It s got a killer name I mean Ya Ya Noodles just sounds yummy So good job to the guy who picked the name Also they give some great crispy things to dip in duck sauce when you sit down The sauce on the food is good The BAD the food isn t all that great Best to order something that cannot be doctored like Lo Mein The UGLY I get the feeling they insert a third element into their general tso s chicken that you don t notice till the food cools a bit so it s hard to enjoy the second half of your plate They aren t alone half of all Chinese restaurants in America seem to have very suspect ingredients It makes me feel that they don t go the extra mile when preparing the food 
DzOxeokuf0__4FqEy4PCbw Princeton American The place itself was pretty cool Well decorated and well comfortable Our server was extremely nice as well I ve been wanting to try this place for a few months Given the interior of the place I was looking forward to good food But sadly the food was bland and tasteless We ordered the risotto cakes for starters and they were too oily the rice was under cooked and needed seasoning The chicken sandwich I got for the meal was bland and tasted stale It had a raw meat smell to it which was a big turn off But we got a beer sampler which was fantastic we got to try all the beers and that was the saving grace of the meal If I was to go back here i d probably only return for the drinks Definitely not the food 
E1RFV6yZ431hgm_pc2DTAQ Princeton American This is the place I go to for good happy hour The wine list is good and the ambiance is amazing The food I do not like I ve never had anything here that has blown me away or that I thought was worth the prices they charge Drinks yes Food no 
E3Skl6-OmBswciFBJPpGBg Princeton American My GF got a living social coupon for this place so we gave it a shot last saturday The interior was pretty cool They have regular tables but we sat at a corner table which I kinda like It was pretty comfy seating too Our server was really friendly and came to check on us often The best thing she did was when she read us the specials not listed on the menu she included the prices I wish more servers would do that so you re not surprised when one of your entrees is 45 bucks Anyways we ordered the curry fried oysters to start and I was really impressed I usually enjoy oysters raw but these were cooked just right They were breaded with a curry batter which was really tasty and crispy and topped with salmon roe which gave it a great complimentary burst of flavor The presentation was pretty simple and elegant I was in the mood for sushi so I got the something roll i forgot but it had eel and tempura shrimp with avocado on the outside 14 I also had an alaska roll and sea urchin sushi 6 and 7 respectively I was disappointed when the rolls came cause the special roll was the same size as the alaska roll Typically the special rolls are bigger and packed with more ingredients right The avocado was over ripen and there were tiny pieces of eel in the special roll If I were judging my entree alone I d give the place a 2 I can t do that cause my gf s crabcakes were pretty awesome It came with a really nice shrimp risotto The crab cakes had very little fillers but still held together pretty well The check came out to be 25 bucks after using a 50 dollar coupon Would I come back Sure if I come across another groupon or living social deal I give this place a 3 5 and round up just because the service was great and the space and presentation was great I just wouldn t get sushi rolls again 
eBOQnb-poqAELPTTXormdA Princeton American Wow service was horrible Got seated at 330 and our waitress took 15 minutes to even come to our table When she FINALLY arrived we ordered a sampler of beers They were out of one but we were never prompted to have a substitute We then ordered a couple of appetizers when she then preceded to tell us that we were sitting at a dinner table like we picked our table We were sat there by the host and pretty much taking up her table for dinner making us feel rushed and as if we were a burden on her and ruined our time there Beer and food were delicious Unfortunate about the service or lack thereof J 
ebvZSy-diO9zn9pHTseLmw Princeton American great place to come for beer and bar food i have never had anything i didn t like 
EDvqNMEMvrgYCCmP60wl7Q Princeton American GREAT PLACE Fantastic food Gruyere Panini for me please Even better service And I am a huge fan of their beers Evan is always changing out their brews for new flavors Great seasonals My favorite spots in the Princeton area 
edx1DlnMuWogypkgOOxkNg Princeton Chinese My family and I come here to eat at least once a month Very tasty and consistent things we crave are The beef tendon tossed in spicy szechuan style oil and Chinese wine marinated chicken Both cheap and REALLY good Recently they started adding sushi to their menu The rolls are done pretty well and the flavors are not bad at all for the grade of fish they are getting It s also fun when the sushi guys throw us a tasting of something random First time was some cooked whitefish meat mixed with some mayo and sriracha or something and crispy panko bread crumbs and more mayo sauce on the bottom Tasty little cooked tartare Second time like 2 weeks later it was some crab tartare kind of thing Tasty The stir fried Udon house noodles are SURPRISINGLY good and I NEVER order stir fried noodles lol Just felt like a filling 8 dollar dish 
eDyk-d49hMc8kEEjB6NVkQ Princeton American Let me start by qualifying my rating this probably deserves a score more along the lines of a 4 5 but considering it is in Princeton a town utterly devoid of gastronomic excellence and I am feeling generous I ll round it up to a 5 It is apparent as soon as one walks in the door that Elements is trying to compete with the top restaurants in NYC where most Princeton residents go for a special meal Sleek and modern in design Elements is both eye catching and comfortable Tables in the main dining room are comfortably spaced apart and it never got particularly loud even when the room was full Two trips to Elements once in December and once last week mid February confirmed for me that this is a very fine restaurant indeed On the first occasion I ordered the prix fixe menu and the second time around I ordered off the a la carte menu On both occasions the menus were interesting and I honestly had a difficult time deciding what to order One dish that particularly stood out on both visits was the 48 hour sous vide short ribs Each time the individual at my table who ordered it crowed with delight upon their first bite Eventually everyone got a taste and it was unanimously described as superb On both trips I ordered a cold fish appetizer a seafood medley with scallops shrimp squid and mussels and a scallop ceviche with capers and kumquats These were perfectly prepared Their meat dishes are quite good too When I ordered the prix fixe menu the first time I got a Filet Mignon dish that was good but honestly if you want to eat great steak go to a NY steak house Their roast breast pheasant was delicious however My advice be adventurous Their chicken and beef dishes are fine but if you go off the beaten path you will be rewarded I honestly can t remember my desert dish from the December trip so I guess it wasn t very memorable not great but not bad either Their cheese tray nonetheless is very good My one issue with Elements on the first trip was the service It took nearly 20 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them when we sat down That was the most egregious example of bad service but there were a few lesser examples The second time around fortunately things went much more smoothly Some might object to Element s relatively high prices but one has to put them in context You are paying for what is easily the best meal to be found in town and one that competes with many of New York s better restaurants If I had to choose between a top restaurant in New York Per Se Daniel etc and Elements I would obviously choose the former But the decision would be complicated if we are talking about the 2nd tier of New York restaurants Blue Hill Union Square Caf come to mind Between the trip into city and New York s even higher prices Elements looks very appealing So in summation I would say go if you get an opportunity I doubt you will be disappointed if you are disappointed go try Princeton s other haute cuisine eateries for example Lahiere s I have a feeling you will come around to appreciate Elements 
EFQfwHaOs45SsgKmWBkUhw Princeton Chinese i am not a chinese man although i do play one on tv no i don t really tiger noodles has the best dumplings in town and they make a few really good dishes the staff is pretty friendly and the outdoor seating is nice princeton has seen a wave of restaurants with outdoor seating these last few years i think for the most part it s a hit what s not a hit is the outdoor seating at the blue point grill next door they recently expanded their seating between the sidewalk and the curb there is seating out front to the sidewalk then they leave the sidewalk clear and start seating again along the curb so you can sit next to someones 1994 toyota what happens when the occupents of that car return to get in it and how about when they start it up how is everything can i get you some more exhaust fumes for your overpriced swordfish sir oh yeah i was reviewing tiger noodles tiger noodles menu seems to be about 3 too expensive for every dish i just can t fall into the whole hey it s princeton line of thinking too expensive is too expensive regardless of location hey it s princeton might work if i was seated atop the grad school tower or on the steps of ole nass or the patio of drumthwacket but on the side of the building along nassau street eek me thinks not don t get me wrong tho tiger noodles is pretty good it s byob it s quick usually tasty and a pretty vibrant atmosphere they could do a better job on the saute string beans and last week we had a VERY poor excuse for broccoli in garlic sauce i swear they used hot wings sauce to flavor that dish i wanted to send it back but associate taster my better half is really reluctant to do that kind of thing because she s sooooooo sweet and kind she s also a broccoli slut and would eat it if it was served over crayons and roofing nails with motor oil ok ok tiger noodles is better than fair not as good as the ivy garden but we d go again order their dumplings they really are quite delicious and delicate how s that 
eGkP1-Iah7G_t5a4qjKQ_Q Princeton American Excellent food Great service will definitely return 
EKp5tmQr3p6S0dSd17_QIQ Princeton American Sadly excellent burgers topped with bacon and fried egg along with a great selection of beers are canceled out by the seriously understaffed dining room We ve given up on grabbing a burger and beer here with a group of friends as on our two most recent visits there s been one waiter to cover the entire tavern and formal dining rooms The formal dining room is a Victorian lovers dream and for the rest of us who live in the 21st century it reminds us of dining at granny s 
ElZ2ELzuaSiVOX6d3XgKeQ Princeton Chinese There are not many reasons to come to Plainsboro but Lotus Garden is one of them I ordered the eggdrop soup best ever with steamed pork dumplings amazing with a steam chicken and veggie dish simply wonderful Nice dine in experience with speedy service and it was very crowded Oh this is important we were the only ones in the restuarant who were not Asian So where do people go for real Chinese food Lotus Garden 
0YopXTgyTUsXGmgVXbOvkA Harvard American I typically tend to avoid hotel restaurants but Henrietta s Table located in the Charles Hotel was a real find It s a bustling little place with a nice bar area and an ample restaurant I really appreciated the focus on local ingredients by their chef who offers a nightly special menu which incorporates the catch of the day and local produce and cheeses Anything and everything you would want is here at Henrietta s Nice beer and wine selection interesting appetizers and a diverse menu For dinner I tried the corn and crab chowder which was dense rich and loaded with chunks of fresh crab meat I also order the skip a whitefish that came with a pesto sauce cheese studded mashers and a side of fiddle head ferns as an aside fiddle head ferns were my downfall at the Elite Cook Off what the heck ARE these things No matter Be prepared the regular menu is a la carte The chef specials are a much better deal Or Henrietta s also offers a 2 or 3 course special which is a good deal If and when the weather ever changes to non soggy in Cambridge head on over for dinner or drinks and appies on the beautiful outdoor patio 
0yZPFcEQeZTEGDei3-WyTw Harvard American I didn t know where my lovely Boston hostess and I were headed and as we passed in front of Green Street I noted that it looked pretty cool Unassuming brick exterior with small windows revealing a calmly lit dining interior So when she opened the door I was excited about going in and checking it out The decor has a clean stylish look with soft green walls and dark hardwood floors Although it was a Friday night we were greeted warmly seated quickly and service continued to be attentive and prompt throughout our meal The menu has a good selection of appetizers and entrees that all sounded wonderful and not too pricey for how gourmet the options were how nice the place looked and the quality of service The wine menu was pretty impressive a great selection styles from different regions US and foreign and at good prices per glass They had my favorite wine Touraine sauvignon blanc which is always a big big positive in my book The drink list was pretty long and creative and the bar area was packed so it also seems like a good place for just drinks too I got the baked mac n cheese with peas carrots and bacon It was pretty good but was a bit pasty and could have used more seasoning I was surprised that it came with a big ol piece of braised pork belly fat that I couldn t bring myself to eat Maybe I m just inexperienced in the ways of eating hunks of lard because the waiter seemed proud of it but that s how I roll All in all I really enjoyed this place but have to give it 4 stars for the lackluster mac n cheese I m definitely going back to try one of their other entrees next time I m in Boston 
0ZdC_ZJux1Ut_j2EOeBSpA Harvard American I m going to try something kind of different here because I felt like there were ups and downs with our brunch series experience So some fun with ratings and weighting and statistical wackiness Service 4 stars Grafton Street was incredibly accommodating considering that our original reservation apparently didn t go through I put in for 9 and they were able to put a table together for us On top of this they sat us and were patient though we were staggering in over the course of an hour Furthermore when the manager came to talk to us to have us move after it became apparent that we were going to have no more than 6 he wasn t demanding or upset just asking As for the waiter he was nice enough though he was kind of missing at points But overall this part was quite good Ambiance 4 stars On the outside I kind of feel like it s comparable to the Taverns on the Square that sort of hey look at me I m a restaurant that can open our windows sort of thing The one primary difference is that the restaurant is spread out like a nice restaurant The tables particularly the circle ones are perfect for exciting conversational wisdom Food 2 5 stars Here come my issues with Grafton Street the food is okay but it s not remarkable Brunch wise I appreciated the pastry basket which did help the overall food However my special omelet wasn t up to snuff The bacon spinach cheese weren t well spread out within the omelet On top of this and arguably more egregious the omelet itself was way too salty I shouldn t be able to overwhelmingly taste the salt in my omelet As for the sides the home fries were okay but the toast was a little huge for its own good As Roni put it they were more like loaves Looking at these three requirements and weighting the scores to emphasize on the food being the most important aspect because this is how I roll I have to settle on a 3 It s okay and manageable and the service is good But that omelet is too salty 
0zdni7-AC8D9LLU052E20A Harvard American Here are the notes of my review that I started several weeks ago and never bothered to finish No flavor Cheeseburger with mushrooms and special sauce that was useless Fries were pleasantly salty but were mostly tiny niblets I d rather pay more and get better food The idea of fried banana cheesecake would be the only reason I d go back 
0zEegk1e2z-dMEHfauEu_Q Harvard American I definitely agree with Ina C that this place was ridiculously overly air conditioned I was freezing by the end of our meal This was not the greatest meal I ve had in the Boston area First of all we were there at a slow time yet our burger orders came out wrong Plus I m not really in the thin patty camp and the fries were just greasy I wish I would have tried the homemade frozen custard That sounded very promising 
0zIIMiHUDllvhDsnLEf0Eg Harvard American Had a cheese burger and fries It was good Nothing flat about them the buns were toasted just right I thought Not bad just your standard burger I would say Nice casual dining 
0ZS1oNeaNnqWZGCCGrmg1w Harvard American I came to the Upstairs for a birthday party and was sorely disappointed I ve wanted to come to this restaurant for quite some time but I won t go back again As everyone says the ambiance is wonderful but the food and service was beyond lacking We had a prix fixe menu for 60 pp 20 automatic gratuity and a 7 meal tax at a table of 13 Perhaps it s because the dishes served were not on the regular menu or they can t handle a large group on a Saturday night but for what I paid this WAS NOT WORTH IT Appetizer Sweet Corn Lobster Chowder Sounds wonderful doesn t it Too bad it was served smidgen above cold The chowder was so thin that it could have been broth and it was served in a bowl too large for the portion You had to tip the bowl to get any on your spoon My boyfriend had no lobster in his bowl and even before the waitstaff haphazardly lobbed the bowls in front of us they were a mess with soup all over edges Main Course Steak au Poivre Another messy plate with 3 different temperatures of meat 1 overdone 1 well and 1 medium Too bad the 1 medium slice had a half inch of fat on it Steak au Poivre is supposed to be a filet with a sear of cracked black pepper sauce However we received a fatty strip steak with burned black pepper and no sauce anywhere on the plate along with a fistful of arugula that wasn t dressed The best thing on the plate was the half mash of crispy potatoes That was very good Dessert Trio of Sorbet and sugar cookies This item is on the regular menu and again did nothing for me The sorbet selections were lemon which was tasty and not too bitter pomegranate which left a strange cotton mouth aftertaste and pear which was at least to me and everyone else at the table who got it not appetizing The cookies tasted nicely but crumbled into a million pieces upon the first bite Service We had one main waitress that was very nice and accommodating however the runners couldn t be bothered to say excuse me after bumping into you when switching out the silverware for the next course or even say your welcome after you thank them for filling your water or serving a dish In all for 2 people we spent roughly 152 40 on food including tip and tax and 66 on drinks I left annoyed and very disappointed that I had spent that much on such poor food 
0ZYwUrRZ_eEVWyTWYJGBQg Harvard American This place cracks me up I liked it better when it was down the street but the whole time it has been a bastion of poseurdom The most hilarious part is checking out the babyfaced Finals Club undergrads in the window as I stroll by en route to somewhere else The food is mediocre but if you need to entertain someone who values atmosphere over taste you could take them here 
0_NI1f5ZP-WgLfBVJOOViw Harvard American Oh B side how I love you There are so many ways I love you The whisky knowledge of the bartender the quirkiness of the menu choices the friendliness of the wait staff The waitress was uber knowledgeable about the menu and helped us get an awesome meal I asked the bartender to give me something good from the many whiskies they have he shared his favorite with me The food was prepared excellently and tasty The b side is so unassuming It whispers to you we do it the way we do because it s better If you re looking for pretense look elsewhere Go for dinner stay for drinks Rinse repeat

0_zEHcIi4Lp4A9EKTS36Og Harvard American As much as I like Veggie Planet in Harvard Square it s so nice to have another option for vegetarian food in Cambridge A friend and I ate dinner at Veggie Galaxy on Friday night It was packed so the hostess expected us to wait 30 45 minutes but the wait ended up being shorter than that It was worth the wait My friend ordered the Brown Cow float and vegetable pot pie and I ordered a peanut butter and chocolate frappe and the Mass Ave Both of our dishes and both of our drinks were tasty Plus the portions were large enough to warrant taking some of the food to go I was thinking of the food and frappe so much the next day that I ordered takeout from Veggie Galaxy that evening The second time I ordered the vegan egg and cheese sandwich with a side of seitan chorizo and the Zebra frappe None of the above disappointed me So far I ve only ordered food of their breakfast menu they serve breakfast all day Maybe I ll try their dinner menu for next time With that said if you re looking for pizza Veggie Galaxy doesn t serve any Go to Veggie Planet instead Veggie Galaxy even says that on its own menu 
10QGOaGKtAU-wJTvtPVKbg Harvard American The food here is great Didn t have any problem ordering a vegan meal just make sure to say you are vegan and the people working there know what is up They were out of a lot of stuff when I went but I understand that as the place is new and they were extremely busy I m sure it won t be a problem for long Service was great My only complaint is that the portions were pretty small I went with 6 other people and only one person s meal was the size I would have expected it to be Everyone else s was pretty tiny For example One of us ordered pancakes and for the price I would have expected like 3 plate size pancakes but instead we got 3 or 4 pancakes the size of the lid of a average tin can Kind of cheap would have been nice to know that because the place doesn t really seem gourmet or anything from the outside I hope that in the future they will offer bigger portions but the food is really delicious So i will be back for sure 
10rFSCTgBfntyKGvpnMUIA Harvard American My wife and I went there on a Sunday night she won a dinner for two there in a drawing I ordered the rock crab and corn chowder for an appetizer and she had the grilled portobello as her appetizer We each had the pulled lamb shank for our entree I didn t notice any actual corn in my chowder which seemed a little odd but it tasted fine and my wife enjoyed her portobello appetizer The pulled lamb shank which was essentially a stew was a nice hearty choice for a cold night Maybe just a tad saltier than I would have preferred but overall very good Dessert for me was the hazelnut cheesecake with pear compote while my wife tried two cheeses from their cheese menu The cheesecake was excellent and my wife was pleased with her cheeses Homey atmosphere especially considering that this is restaurant in a hotel Our server was very good she was helpful with suggestions and very attentive Portion sizes aren t huge compared to the prices plan to pay 100 for dinner for two and don t expect to leave with leftovers If your goal is to leave feeling overstuffed then this probably isn t the place for you Before dinner I ordered a Manhattan on the rocks It was well made and large though the 11 price tag was a little higher than I expected We ll probably go back sometime even though we don t have a free meal 
114QIdpHcAHT7zZ36FZtgw Harvard Chinese This is the easiest review I ll ever have to write Night time Scorpion Bowls Drunk Harvard undergrads with an occasional sprinkling of a 20 something crowd tons of dancing Day time Scorpion Bowls and decent chinese food Recommended for people who like to get drunk hit on undergrads while dancing 
13cVZOSovleZmjyY5c7i5Q Harvard American You could easily miss Green Street if you weren t looking for it However you should definitely NOT miss Green Street This hidden restaurant truly is a little gem The bartenders are fantastic and make some great drinks The food is a hit and several people have mentioned that this joint serves the best burger around Their mac cheese is killer too Hop into Green Street for just drinks and end up staying for dinner 
13W5RtZixduDbQCqJhRQbA Harvard American Visited Rendezvous with a friend after visiting with a group of youth to see the chef s rooftop garden What a cool ingenious setup he had on his rooftop Check out his blog to see some pics http www rendezvouscentralsquare com category blog Steve the chef was so generous and kind in his tour of his restaurant and garden so I knew I definitely wanted to come back and try the food Overall really good atmosphere waitstaff food We had the tapas menu on Monday nights Squid with arroz negro which was yummy rice as black as the night and tender squid with a smoky grilled flavor Roasted cauliflower and pinenuts great nutty flavors Muhummara a tomato based pesto of sorts with great Indian ish spices The bread basket was really tasty And we also got the lemon buttermilk pudding with huckleberry sauce for dessert on the chef Lots of yumminess A little bit on the salty side with some of the dishes but great flavors Indian spices and great portion size Will definitely go back to check out the other dishes 
13xO2YnZviGosT1eFkrqqQ Harvard American I did not have a proper meal the time that I was there and I can t recall while I think I was at the time too exhausted to eat But I sat there and was enthralled The decor is not that bland Boston crap epitomized by fugly Finale It s a jewel A really precious emerald ruby sapphire one 
14Jt7p4kfCXC1To1mfugzA Harvard Chinese The quality of the meats here are of particularly poor quality The two times I ve gone I have been literally injured by my food razor sharp chicken bones hidden in my supposedly boneless meat The veggies have always seemed rather squishy in a way that doesn t make me too confident about their freshness When they mean spicy they REALLY mean spicy For some dishes the spice is great and as a spicy food lover I really enjoyed it However there are some dishes here that are frankly terrible because any flavor is completely offset by how spicy they make it If you are sensitive to spicy food I suggest you go elsewhere almost everything here has a bit of bite to it Chinatown may be a bit of a hike but it is worth it to find much cheaper fresher and better balanced food 
14JWSif5v0d-pdvyvVKmGA Harvard American The Red House is great in both the winter and summer In the winter you can sit in the bar area next to a roaring fire and sip cocktails whilst in the summer you can sit on the deck and sip cocktails no alcoholic beverages with food only restrictions here it s a private deck hurrah Oh and the food is great too sort of contemporary American meets European and I love that most of the main courses are also available as half portions Whenever we re out and about in Harvard Square my husband and I always seem to end up in the bar or on the deck nibbling at olives and drinking martinis As a side note my husband and I decided to hold our rehearsal dinner here and we couldn t have had a better evening there was something to suit everyone and the service was impeccable 
14quuErYK60egEkhGrmd7Q Harvard Chinese SUPER for VEGETARIANS All meals can be made vegatarian Waiter was very friendly and brought us a free appetizer There is outdoor dining but the fence is so high you can t people watch and none of your friends can spot you either SO If you want privacy but your date wants to dine outside GO HERE smile BUT The lobster with hot garlic sauce I ordered was very forgetable The menu implied it was a sauteed dish yet my LOBSTER ARRIVED IN THE SHELL just chopped into pieces My dish came with NO VEGETABLES AT ALL My partner was served PLAIN WHITE RICE in a side bowl 
165KYkrZnDWLYPY1dYk3jg Harvard American We were in the mood for some good food and some fun Wow did we have both Being a large group 9 we started off with their small plates and shared Great way to start off The Egg in a Jar was fabulous but crispy chicken skin amuse bouche with malt vinegar aioli is my new guilty pleasure who hasn t pulled a bit of the skin off the roasted chicken as it comes out of the oven Their drinks are fabulous and there were raves about the beer choices The dinners were cooked to perfection and the desserts were simple and satisfying just what was needed to cap off a delightful and fun evening We cannot wait to try West Bridge for lunch and are already planning our next visit 
173lXjcCs8B4GgCWYuiD5Q Harvard American The first time I went here for my girlfriend s coworker s birthday I had a great time The second time I went back I was not nearly as enthused I ordered a bourbon neat I think the waitress heard BOURBON 1 11 1 NEAT What came out was a rocks glass filled to the top with ice and boubon that became so watered down that it looked like a glass of iced tea When she placed it on our table I mentioned how I ordered the drink neat not on the rocks and she had a puzzled look on her face thus proving she had no idea what I meant Look if a bar had an extensive scotch and bourbon menu at least know what the term neat means I said that I could live with the drink as is but I immediately regretted that and sent it back When she came back with my drink as ordered it was less than a half pour of bourbon I can handle a mix up on the drink order but really spiting me with less booze is a no no especially when I am already paying a 30 premium on what I ordered since this bar tries to be slightly upscale in atmosphere and thus price x 4 With so many other great choices in Harvard Square I won t be back 
18chGDnTx-Px_xstrleXyw Harvard American I LOVE this place The first time I went I wasn t that impressed seemed like a lot of meat and potatoes to me Then I went back and tried the fresh side dishes a salad and soup When butternut squash is in season you must order it it s out of this world The salads are all delicious combination of greens nuts and cheese The pumpkin soup is amazing And the meat dishes are pretty solid too Plus the bathrooms are super nice since it s in the Charles hotel Seating can get tight when it s crowded but the waiters waitresses deal with it well 
18d4vJQkIdb0Ja1OhZz7aw Harvard American Comfortable lively yet quiet atmosphere Good comfort food 
18sLGB0ZE5uNEznIxDBolQ Harvard Chinese First off bravo for serving for meat on a stick Bravo Sure the concept of a scorpion bowl is cool but considering the small amount of alcohol for 15 I could get more buzzed off a big gulp slurpee from Qwik E Mart If you and your crew can get drunk off one of these note I have drunk one by myself you need to step up your game That being said the bartender is cool shit and very courteous Plus the 6 Jack on the rocks are generously poured which is a rarity here in puritanical Boston Still 6 Jager shots or 6 any shots for that matter are overpriced All in all I really enjoy this place The staff does seem to appreciate your business which you don t see often 
18W8Nks8d2n4AQCuPoQlSQ Harvard American LOVE finale The desserts are totally worth 8 But the very best dessert is those delicious chocolate cookies It is very possible they will be sold out when you go though One problem every and I mean 3 times time I try to go to eat a meal there the fire alarm has gone off and we had to evacuate I m serious this has happened THREE times It is the strangest thing So I can t tell you how the non dessert food is 
1a10nZhAwtNlisDqYewjAg Harvard American Braved the first snow on Saturday night and sat at the bar with a friend for dinner and drinks First of all the view of the snow through the front windows was beautiful Love the art installations on the back wall as well This place just has a lot of character The cocktails were yummy our two bartenders were really sweet and helpful and impressed us with their skills on the raw bar Speaking of which they serve the largest shrimp imaginable here We re talking shrimp as big as your hand Lots of corny shrimp jokes abounded 
1AN08K4n6_OA5KRsizMjtA Harvard American Harvard Club is a privilege Feels cerebral elegant My mother in law is a Professor and we dine here frequently It s a lovely historical building Typically there s a large lily bouquet when you walk in the door making the entrance smell heavenly Dinner or Brunch are both great options I highly suggest the oysters Super fresh with a great sauce Also try the apple tart The crust is flaky Yum Only negative my water glass and spoon were both filthy during my last visit Service can be spotty as well Example waiter trying to take food order before wine and water If you get a chance go 
1AqvyP3h2mDPJyX3X2Ip0A Harvard American Greasy goodness My BF and I were looking for a good greasy hamburger place because we wanted some serious hamburger and french fries goodness The bad reviews on this place said that it was too greasy so we thought it would be a great place for us to lunch And oh it was There is not much seating though so beware The fries are pretty good but the french fries are better The bottled sodas aren t cold so go with a fountain drink I got the regular burger and he got a double The grease dribbled down my chin and soaked the bun PERFECT 
1bTKgS0FpwBCt-E2GaNnoQ Harvard American My brother suggested this place as a relaxing place to get breakfast in Harvard Square He definitely was right about the atmosphere It didn t feel frenzied at all and it had lots of light coming in through the windows We shared a fresh fruit platter as a starter and I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings The quality of the fruit was pretty good and in addition to the usual fruit plate suspects like cantaloupe sliced orange and honeydew there were also some surprises red currant and dried dates I didn t like the latter but it was still novel I had a bowl of cheesy grits and a buttermilk biscuit The biscuit was huge and nicely crusty on the outside and tender on the inside The grits could have been seasoned more even though it had a decent amount of shredded cheddar on top Now this isn t firsthand but apparently the ham served here from Harrington s of Vermont is a family favorite Ham lovers do what you will with that bit of information While this was a pleasant dining experience I think I ll save any future visits for when my family visits from out of town and craves ham 
1bz7b6PoiMWua25ivDS99g Harvard American The food at Russell House Tavern is delicious They accomplished what Green Street did not a crispy fried poached egg that was oozy and amazing in the middle Oozing over the toasted brioche and the pancetta and the amazing aioli The same aioli that was scraped clean off my plate with an extra piece of bread If plate licking was socially acceptable I would have The Andria burrata mission figs and garlic was the perfect combo of sweet and savory Perfect for sharing Figs on a pizza a revelation This was my first experience with figs aside from jam the verdict Figs Figs Figs Delicious Rounding out the eats spiced ginger cake It didn t look like much but layered with coffee buttercream it was heavenly A great texture and a really delicate flavor Yum The bevvies are in a class of their own I had been planning on drinking beer but after perusing the cocktails I changed my mind quickly I had the Battle of Trafalgar Pimms St Germain delightful Sweet and so so good I had a quick sip of the Wigglesworth So so nice Loved the atmosphere we sat at some high tops in the upstairs bar area The service was great our server was super adorable Can t wait to go back 
1cg2W8xPV6DKn0eLgCtu7w Harvard American Is it a pub Is it a bistro Not sure A bit schizophrenic Came to stay in Harvard Square for a business trip and actually ended up eating here twice The first time was for brunch which was actually pretty good Either that or I was simply just ravenous after landing from my redeye I ordered a huge omelet with home fries and toast Can t really go wrong with that The service was only so so Perhaps my server just flew in on a red eye as well Then I went for dinner the next night with a group of 15 Kudos to our server who was super chill and patient For dinner the food is expensive and not that great That s when I was confused if this place was meant to be a fancy place due to the fancy prices Can t imagine the students around the area digging this place at least for dinner but that s just me 
1cuHSl4GrQY7w5ElQ0xQuw Harvard American This review is specifically for the weekend brunch which is very underrated The Bow Street Breakfast eggs potatoes meat bread fruit is under 10 and Grafton s coffee is surprisingly excellent Lavazza And never a long wait 
1d4SX51Ntw76vLHH2xZQ_g Harvard American Had dinner here a couple of weeks ago with my brother his girlfriend and a friend of mine For a starter we had the tuna and avocado tartare This was nice and light Great for the summer time and pretty tasty For dinner Friend had the roasted chickpea burger It comes folded in a piece of naan I had a piece and it was pretty good I had the grilled scallops Scallops were well cooked and came out juicy and in a bed of delicious butternut squash puree My brother had the salmon he said it was pretty good I didn t try any His girlfriend ordered a BBQ chicken pizza It came on top of a wood board which I felt was a nice touch It s pretty big for a personal pizza and would act as a good starter among 4 people In summary it didn t blow me away but it s a great place to catch a casual dinner in Harvard Square 
1DxerEzBAaqWxB3y5SBzrw Harvard Chinese This is a good place to get some good Chinese food on the cheap Some of their dishes are better than others but generally they re all pretty good I ve noticed the service can be hit or miss but most of the time it s been fine Seating has never been a problem A couple of times they ve had Chinese mountain cabbage as a special which I actually liked quite a bit especially considering it s just cabbage I d recommend it for a healthy well depending on what s in the sauce side dish They don t take credit cards which catches some people by surprise 
1fLY8N2vgGXW55c5PbxxtA Harvard Chinese Have you tried a Scorpion Bowl yet Sarah Hey have you been to Hong Kong yet for a Scorpion Bowl Hey Sarah you need to go try a Scorpion Bowl etc etc etc I think that since moving to boston besides people telling me that I am going to freeze this would be the second most mentioned thing to me so I guess Scorpion Bowls are up there with the Red Sox in this city At least according to how often I ve heard about it This venue is supposedly not as cool as the one in Boston but for being closer to my house I m down The upstairs is the bar downstairs is the restaurant and my one pet peeve is they do not have vents on their AC vents and we were all FREEEEEZZZZZING If our Scorpion Bowls had any less alcohol in them they probably would have frozen over And you ask what a Scorpion Bowl is Well it is a giant bowl full of about 7 8 shots of premixed alcohol and fruity juice served with a couple REALLY LONG straws and plastic animals like a giraffe elephant monkey and a mermaid were thrown on top Random right I would think little plastic scorpions would have been thrown in but I guess that would probably gross customers out BUT it is pretty tasty and definitely packs a punch We got a pu pu platter too but honestly it was just fried and greasy not so great the spring roll tasted way way over fried and the won tons just leaked oil so next time we ll pass on that and focus on the scorpion bowl 
1fnreo0yAN27QR8ayP3ftA Harvard Chinese I ve eaten here a couple times since I wrote my initial review and I ve decided to drop a star because they aren t as great as I first thought they were I think it s the atmosphere the servers are nice but the place has a homely feel to it And now with Shabu ya down the street there really is no reason to come here anymore except for the mango and sticky rice dessert which is very yummy Sorry Shabu Square 
1fTTrcD2KI2WXYsosZCSIQ Harvard American 3 20 for a floppy cheeseburger McDonald s does them for one third of that price so is Flat Patties cheeseburger 3 times better No Maybe only twice as good and twice as good as a McDonald s cheeseburger is NOT a compliment I appreciate the sentiment of trying to run an alternative burger fast food joint but bland buns thin low quality patties and not much else is not going to win you any fans This is way way behind Kenmore Sq s U Burger And it s in a food court too never a good sign 
1GNcpDVYdkYYCvgLn2AcDQ Harvard Chinese Mary s is all about the red ink dishes If you don t like spicy you ll probably wonder why people love the place so much For the most part the dishes printed in black ink are nothing special though some of the appetizers are solid I have a weakness for the Crab Rangoon But if you DO enjoy a bit of burn you ll love the Suans the Dun Dun noodles the hot and sour soup and just about any spicy main dish But maybe not the chicken velvet I just can t get past the texture of that The Peking ravioli and the scallion pancakes aren t spicy by themselves but the spicy dipping sauce that comes with them is what makes them really special Have the ravs at the restaurant they don t travel well Wine and beer are available the wine list is limited to house red and white and the beer list is short but has a couple of good choices No dessert at all Mary gave up on them years ago If you crave a sweet after your meal walk across the street to Toscanini s 
1gVA6C2luf25BVCmicU52Q Harvard American My roommate s Englishness is really rubbing off on me As much as he abhors American English I embrace Britishisms like brilliant absolutely brilliant and you want to splurge but save money at the same time What bollocks Should really keep the Masterpiece Theatre programming to a minimum though although who could blame you if PBS was your English teacher Be thankful my reviews don t digress ala Sesame Street or Mr Rogers although Service was impeccable the food wine pairings delectable the bathrooms spa like and comes with complementary views of the bar and kitchen An order of the chef s tasting will allow you to sample virtually everything on the menu rearranged as he sees fit 2 dessert plates included But if you want duck call ahead they only keep a couple on hand each night but will reserve one just for you Brilliant brilliant brilliant It s just simply brilliant when you can end an evening licking black salt off your plate 
1H-UlchnynKOg9fVh_d0Ow Harvard American The rush of pre theater goers seemed too much for a restaurant that should have the routine down flawlessly We were asked to order our food within minutes of arriving yet our drink orders were not asked for till nearly 30 minutes after sitting I ordered the sirloin medium rare and it was served a shade more than well A true measure of the flow of a kitchen is the simple but not easy presentation of steak cooked appropriately My suggestion is to double the staff both on the floor and in the kitchen 
1hJdetgdFXcS5H9iht-qAA Harvard American Unquestionably the best restaurant at which I have dined in Boston Both in absolute terms and at this price point Full stop The atmosphere is comfortable and unpretentious and the staff are both knowledgeable and interested in discussing the details of the food that they are serving It is very much a place where foodies feel at home yet a mere culinary mortal such as your truly did not feel condescended On the contrary the emphasis on fresh local ingredients inspired me to search out new varieties of produce at my neighborhood farmers market For wine we had the controversial carignan It was very bright as warned but excellent for what it was We ordered over half the menu in small plates Everything was excellent Most enjoyable were the mushroom salad fresh hen of the woods mushrooms are great this time of year scallops burnt eggplant puree was a nice combination and the lamb shoulder turnip puree was amazing addition Bondir truly puts to rest the stereotype of New England as a wasteland of bad expensive produce Who knew local food could taste so good 
1HlVtppyVL2qcJgryrTDNg Harvard Chinese This small spot is a a bit of a hidden gem It is not a place you would even think to go into unless someone told you it was ok as the curb appeal leaves a bit to be desired The food is quick and flavorful It is hard to find a table during a weekday lunch as it is a popular spot among many local workers It is much quieter at dinner because it does not have a dinner ambiance Service is quick 
1HUMm-FwUsLBIbylcGojFg Harvard Chinese Despite Mary Chung s sketchy looks we decided to take out here after the recommendation of a friend and yelpers We got szechuan chicken and dun dun noodles The chicken was okay at first Then we ate some noodles and the spiciness spread in our tummies like a horrendous flame We both really like spicy especially bf but this wasn t the type of spice that has a wonderful rich roundness and body to it It was a harsh and abrasive hotness After a couple bites I couldn t taste any actual flavors just an aggressive onslaught of salt 
1I7STAgQtq7J-qZg5y7f_A Harvard American I had been hoping that this place would be slightly cheaper kind of like the restaurant equivalent of getting a haircut at a beauty school Nonetheless the food is tasty 
1iceyy11axU7ejUDB6diuA Harvard Chinese I only went once but most of the crucial menu items were decidedly sub par I haven t gone since the renovation so I m sure the ambience will be better at compensating for the poor food 
1IquqNpvYNOziBqubkoKFQ Harvard American Go once and don t go again Preferably you will be in high school when you go for the first and only time so as to get it out of your system early This place is a souped up and over priced cafeteria essentially It even starts to feel a little like a cafeteria after an hour or so You get to pick your own stuff yeah yeah yeah which is kind of fun see above go once recommendation but the final product is not spectacular and certainly not worth the money for a second round With drinks and any type of appetizer it s pretty expensive and you re really paying to watch the chefs in the middle of this big grill try not to mix your super spicey vegetarian stir fry with your neighbor s sweet meat lovers mix The biggest drawback for me No cheese 
1IyGJqT-1rSD6_lbYOVzog Harvard American After hearing a bunch of people say how good Russell House was i picked it a bit at random as a place to meet someone for dinner the other night because this is how one learns new things Walking up i was wondering if i might ve screwed up since it looked busy but actually we were seated nearly instantaneously Earlier in the week i was pretty psyched to eat something awesome and delicious but i was fighting off a cold by the time Thursday rolled around which sorta sucked Anyway other reviews have questioned the service but i didn t really have reason to it was prompt and courteous without being exceedingly friendly The beer list is very well considered and though they were out of Harpoon s imperial red the locally brewed double IPA they had replaced it with was smooth delicious and strong i can only assume that the wine list is also good The food was merely good and i was a bit underwhelmed Like i said i was looking forward to a good meal but i was feeling pretty crummy so i just ordered a pizza Despite being thin crusted it retained heat like crazy and was scorching hot pretty much the whole time It was clearly made with some care from good ingredients but it just didn t taste very good Other than that though it s a nice place to eat outside ish in a brick alcove just off of Harvard Square and that alone is enough for me to give it another try 
1j1iBOpkV_3lAqn-SqCl4g Harvard American The food here is really good It s simple with fresh often natural ingredients The menu also changes seasonally and incorporates food from local suppliers Last time I was there there was cheese from a local farm The atmosphere is nice and spacious and they have a good attentive waitstaff who are knowledgeable about the menu This place is spacious enough for larger groups and also has outdoor seating When I go I almost always get the salmon entree and it is always perfect The bread basket is friggen awesome too The prices are moderate I actually prefer this place to Rialto next door although Rialto is also good Henrietta s Table is much less fussy It s a great place to go when you don t want to make a major event of your dinner I often will grab a bite here and then head upstairs to the Regatta Bar and listen to some jazz 
1jaq_1LTRBEkWianSeD07Q Harvard American I ve been in here twice The first time was impressive until I got my entree which I wasn t that pleased with I had a very tiny portion of salmon for 33 and was disappointed in the fact that I left hungry after spending over 120 on dinner So I emailed the owner afterwards instead of blowing steam on yelp She was completely professional and sent me a gift certificate to go back Time to put it to use and do a review I recently returned again with my Yelp Kendall Passport and took advantage of the free drink and appetizer along with dinner It was perfect timing to celebrate an anniversary too For the appetizer we got the seafood sausage It was delicate and tasty Everything was ground up like sausage The bartender highly recommended it I chose in advance to get the 39 pre fixed menu The selection that night was a pate which I have had there before and was delicious Along with that I got the roasted chicken The chicken was amazing The best I ever had Super juicy with so much flavor My boyfriend got the pork three ways entree which he gobbled down For 36 he was a bit disappointed with the small amount on the plate after it it was just pork so why so skimpy It was a good thing I had enough chicken cause he shared the rest to feel full One thing I wish this place would do is add a bit more to your entree or beef up the size of what you get both times I found one of the entrees to be very skimpy for the hefty price The tasting menus look substantial but are in the 75 95 range per person I really thought the food was great however there really should be a veggie or starch on the plate to balance it out when you are already paying 36 for your entree For dessert we had a berry cobbler Again it was delicious and just a great way to end the meal Drinks were poured creatively Everything is carefully measured out and quickly replenished Service at the bar was friendly almost interactive as you watched them make some cool drinks dropping potions here and there It reminded me of Drink a little bit The food is very tasty and the place has the right customer service attitude Clearly there are some very well trained chefs in there For the steep prices though and tiny portions I probably won t rush back 
1jbZUTliZmSq1nMmvldTrg Harvard American Upstairs on the Square gets one star for their over the top Patricia Field meets Martha Stewart God only knows how tall Christmas tree They also get one star for their absolutely delicious Zebra birthday cake while it was not my birthday I was given the option to order this specialty which was nice The final star is for the general ambiance of the place It was definitely not my style but they put an immense amount of effort into the decor which is something that I cannot ignore Upstairs on the Square has a very Fairfield County CT in the 70s feel to it Like The Ice Storm I sincerely believe that one with the right sensibility and temperament and bank account and breeding will simply ADORE this place 
1jkhgNTuv0NT1vWDjDt_vQ Harvard American The best part about this place is the fact that you can just fill your bowl with as much steak tenderloin shrimp as you want Who needs veggies or pasta anyways All they do is fill you up or contribute to a longer healthier life Add a pitcher of beer and you ll soon forget all about the fact that you just picked your own raw meats fish off of a buffet and watched someone else cook it for you on a grill next to other peoples raw meats fish Chances are you ll be back and will repeat the process over and over and over again p 
1JKhPCebV_1gz3gLai6HQQ Harvard American I still dig this place The food has gotten better and Lou is still cute Haiku Review 
1JMI_sbJSf_4pnpxIXPeqg Harvard American Summary Excellent knowledgeable service great food Worth the price I came here with my boss and colleagues for lunch and the food was excellent The waiter was very knowledgeable with the menu and was able to describe the sauce how the food was cooked stuff that makes me feel that I can make a good decision between the rainbow trout and their special They were serving their special fish tacos that day and I ordered it The fish was very fresh and nicely fried People at the table ordered the rainbow trout and ravioli and had only praises for their food I loved the lunch so much that I came back for dinner with the boyfriend We got the ceasar salad on recommendation by the waiter True to what he said the egg was a whole hard boiled egg with a crispy shell breaded and fried on the side It was yummy We got the rotisserie chicken entree and the blue cod My chicken was excellently cooked the breast was tender and well seasoned I didn t feel the blue cod as much I had the coke float was average but the dinner left a great impression on me because of that juicy tender chicken I cam here a third time for lunch with a friend and we shared the lunch rotisserie chicken and rainbow trout Oh wow the trout was amazing I know rainbow trout is deliciously by itself but the skin was so nicely crisped I wish they could just serve me more of the fish skin The chicken was again excellent 
1JPHzAbCZHKk8H-afZAJjw Harvard American Yessssssssssss This is going to become an epicenter for Boston area vegans There is no other place in town that could serve flat beer and get away with a five star review Why Vegan brunch vegan desserts vegan milkshakes all done right This place is Willy Wonka s for vegans You can get a veggie burger anywhere but if you need to balance the stack of sweets with real food their burgers are great The Beer Battered Tofu thanks for not calling it a quirky vegan name that rhymes with fish and chips is the kind of dish that makes vegan brains explode when they realize they can eat something they long ago gave up on You know that giddy jumping up and down accompanied with maniacal laughter as they exclaim I can eat this that vegans do Half my party was omni and loved the food too so VG should have no problem luring in the After Middle East crowd if they do end up staying open that late Hopefully they will do all they can to rake because this place NEEDS to stay open Bonus Eames fabric on the seats The space is very nicely designed not hippie hokey Huge bonus points earned 
1K3P7mHqcY7DighpyULikA Harvard American We had our wedding at the Harvard Faculty Club and the entire staff did a superb job making sure everything went smoothly Everything was perfect We have also been here for Sunday brunch It is quite a treat The food is delicious and there is plenty of it and it is a great atmosphere usually a pianist etc 
1kCgDjlzHFoy1l_mS4Tpeg Harvard American Despite the faint fishy smell that permeates the place I kinda got used to it and my olfactory senses had habituated somewhat after many beers We stood by the bar then moved to a large table service was prompt Food was actually quite decent and the chicken tender was surprisingly tender under that crusty exterior 
1KDDTRVNlggWpAwevqGXnw Harvard American Eating at the Harvard Faculty Club sends a certain message And that message is I know a faculty member at Harvard who is willing to eat a meal with me The interior is pretty and not stuffy Rather than overstuffed chairs and people smoking cigars like in the Yale Club in NYC the dining room is light and airy The entrance way was filled with beautiful green orchids The food was very good I had the Roasted Beets with local micro greens pistachios and spiced yogurt honey sauce This was a nice serving of purple and yellow beets The sauce was light and not overpowering I followed with Seared Striped Bass squash and root vegetable hash and parsley oil Like the appetizer it was light and a nice portion size Not too big but it didn t leave me hungry If you have the opportunity to go I would recommend it 
1Kjk1NbCm_Zh8LefXufusw Harvard American Chicken roll up sandwich was so so though I have to say their 5 4 3 2 1 happy hour is a pretty good deal The 10 Black Dhalia however was not worth the high ratings someone else on this board gave Shards of ice in my cocktail Gross 
1ktUeLJVOfF_G9Vp69wiHQ Harvard Chinese If you re living near MIT and you need Thai pick up that s walkable then maybe this is a good option I d already discounted my opinion given they do mostly take out but I was still disappointed Noodle dishes are all a bit watery flavor is just so so and thai iced tea was watered down I gave the usual khap khun krap to say thank you in Thai but the owners and wait staff just stared blankly Seriously if you re going to run a Thai restaurant at least understand hello and thank you 
1L4QuTEAMZP20Y7i0qL8IA Harvard American ok i know some people love it others hate it but i love it i like being able to pick out my food and my sauce i can eat as healthy or as piggish as i please plus if you re a drunk munchie person its nice to have all you can eat after you knock back a few of their cocktails although it s been getting dirtier and dirtier the last few times i ve been 
1l4wyR6nLSRB4ruv2Rz-Wg Harvard American Enjoyed an excellent meal at Upstairs On the Square a couple weeks ago Happened to be there during Restaurant week hadn t planned it and ended up ordering off the set menu Appetizer was a small cake like preparation of haddock similar texture to a crab cake served with greens The sirloin was cooked to perfection small portion sliced and served with fingerling potatoes with crumbled gorgonzola Bread pudding for dessert was literally the best bread pudding I ve ever had Restaurant itself has kind of funky interior decor that stretches across several levels Service was just right there and pleasant when you needed it not there when you didn t Would definitely go again 
1m7aGMCAofDuDcm9lecFfg Harvard American This review is really based on the fact that this is where you want to go Before you go here you need to realize a few things 1 The waiters are there to bring you DRINKS only You ll need to help yourself to food It s an uncooked buffet 2 On that subject it s an uncooked buffet so after you wait in line for your ingredients you need to wait to get a spot at the grill and have your food cooked 3 And I stress this again it s still a BUFFET Buffet food is not traditionally good food The food here is decent but don t go here expecting anything orgasmic To sum it up you re going out to eat at a place where you aren t waited on the food won t be cooked exactly to your specifications and the food will be mediocre at best That being said this place is actually REALLY GOOD if you re looking more to have a fun unique time when going out to eat instead of a nice meal You ll make a few trips you ll spend half the night waiting while standing and you ll throw away quite a few mistakes But it ll be a blast inventing some new dish Good for groups or a date whether it s first or fiftieth It loses a star for weak ass drinks and in the end it s still a restaurant with busboys only I can t in good conscience give a restaurant like that 5 stars Other than that s all good baby 
1mt1pO6Yyte5wFEBdfE5Aw Harvard American I came here acouple of times for lunch the food is great lots of good lunch options and the decor feels very homey It is a local place in the center of MIT campus which has great lunch specials good portions and great for meetings Today I had the chicken salad on a bed of lettuce and tomato the chicken salad was dressed in a pesto dressing and the combination was great I have previously had the turkey cheese apple wrap and home made chips all of which I have enjoyed I recommend a reservation as service is a bit slow and unfortunately not that great Middle aged woman who served us totally seemed like annoyed that we asked her for stuff Get over it lady it s called power lunch for a reason 
1mtNLtqEbEXgo1_exNLPew Harvard American one of the best restaurant i ve ever been to food is fantastic and service is excellent unlike other restaurants servers at this restaurant do have hearts 
1my3lLJImijbPr5nJfrjyw Harvard American I travel a lot and on a recommendation from Yelp visited this location for dinner OUTSTANDING Service was great Atmosphere was good The meal was incredible had the coveted and much talked about hamburger BEST hamburger and homemade condiments I ve ever tasted Had a side of brussel sprouts baked with duck fat YUM Overall one of the best meals I ve had in Boston Pricetag for the evening very very reasonable wow 
1nCqM4iRq7UbyNuqrju5WQ Harvard American It s such a shame This restaurant is so cute inside and the server was super nice But the food is really not very good As in bad GF got lobster fra diavola and the lobster was fine but the pasta and the sauce were really underwhelming I ordered a papardelle in goulash which I was really excited about Unfortunately the goulash was really watery and underseasoned and the noodles were mushy Not soft mushy And this doesn t even go into the watery apple cider cocktail we went in the fall and the fact that I got a weird look when I sent back a beer for being skunked it was and I got a replacement that tasted fine If there is a redeeming factor to this place it s the key lime pie Awesome crust awesome filling Get it if you feel like salvaging the meal 
1NOC9312Ep7BrxSLfm063w Harvard American To start a 30 minute wait became an hour wait Not the staff s fault for the wait it was Saturday night but kind of their fault for not guesstimating correctly Remember it s all about underpromising and overdelivering in the service industry Once we were seated our waitress was a doll the bar we sat at had hooks under the table as all bars should have and the food was good if overpriced Note if you get the greens with your burger you will get a LOT of greens It was like a full salad On the other hand if you order the small place brussel sprout salad it will be so small you ll wonder if they messed up Overall delicious Overpriced but ok given the area Beers were also wonderful with a wide assortment Lively atmosphere could be good for drinks or a casual date out 
1nQ8xYanKUgk1WhD5tX2lQ Harvard American The food including creative small plates like deviled eggs with shrimp and avocado cocktails and craft beer are three reasons to get excited about Russell Tavern Plates are well presented and the kitchen does a fantastic job of layering flavors and textures My wife and I were there twice yesterday once to check the place out and see if we wanted to return for dinner with our son We had a friendly knowledgeable bartender The first thing he did after greeting us was to pour a couple of glasses of water We washed down aforementioned deviled eggs with pints of Harpoon Belgian Ale and a dark German wheat beer Both were excellent We liked the menu and reserved a table for dinner in the bar Fast forward and we re back with our 10 year old after his hockey game ended Dinner was Pt Judith Trace Trust Bluefish w Creamed Verrill Farms Corn Roasted Pink Eggplant Radish Salad 23 Ozark Heritage Pork Trio Loin Belly Shoulder with Anson Mills Grits and Sauce Vinegar 23 and Steak Frites at 24 All were delicious The bluefish portion could have been a little more generous Service is where Russell Tavern really needs to improve It took 10 minutes for our server to arrive then another 15 to get bread and 45 minutes to get our entrees after ordering The restaurant was busy but it was only 6 15 and that s far too long to wait The server should have come by to let us know what the situation was Instead I had to flag her down and ask when the meals would arrive Also the tables in the bar are much too close uncomfortably so There were six inches between our table and the one next to us I d give Russell Tavern another shot but I d take more control of the meal by insisting on better service Please let me know what you think of this review by clicking a button below Thanks 
1OiUW5KZN1OzbFMeshQw5g Harvard American Fantastic food and service Will definitely go back From the appetizer to dessert it was absolutely delicious Gold Plate 
1P3AdBAKWqO_-EiIoe-cTQ Harvard American Great Saturday brunch Food was great and the service was very good also I had the three course prix fie with the pork stew and my wife had the quiche both were very good Wine list was a little thin which means no Oregon Pinots 
1piIxTdIKS0cHt9-u2xfWA Harvard American It doesn t get much better than this place Although I have never eaten here the cocktails are some of the best in the area They have a 5 6 page cocktail menu with a great selection of sweet dry and sour drinks Also the prices aren t bad Between 7 10 for a cocktail They also have a great bottled beer selection with craft beers from all over the country It s a nice atmosphere and very low key A great place to meet up with a friend for a drink I wouldn t take a big group the place is not rowdy and definitely caters to a more subdued crowd Overall I love it Slam dunk for Green Street I look forward to going back soon 
1piRUGc-6JD1_wbxIAz3Vw Harvard Chinese World s finest dun dun noodles right here Seriously I ve been around the world and have had dun dun noodles in many cities on several continents and these are my favorite With chicken or without they re cheap hearty and spicy as hell The dumplings aren t bad either Downside tea is awful and many dishes aren t bad but are pretty ordinary No credit cards so hit the ATM before you come here 
1PXTcQJuMFXUhcdX4ibMFQ Harvard American I thoroughly enjoyed everything I tried at Za This place came highly recommended from a friend so I had been dying to try it Their salads are unique and delicious so are the pizzas We tried the avocado cucumber and potato salad I loved the avocado salad a little more than the other one but both were very good We tried a pizza with a medley of unusual toppings corn bacon potatoes it was absolutely delish It was gone in minutes The atmosphere is casual yet warm Service was friendly on point I highly recommend Za when you are looking for a casual spot with good food I ll definitely be back to try some of their other offerings 
1QOhDAGT_0pDpGNqB-MtHw Harvard American I went here for their all you can eat Sunday Brunch Yes they have a very impressive spread some notable mentions oysters shrimp prime rib smoked salmon and a super desert table with two types of whoppie pies even Also the unlimited fresh squeeze orange juice was a plus If you like traditional breakfast items they will also make to order your omelet and they have good sausages and wheat waffles Now the downsides The food tasted bland And it is crowded and noisy Not what I would call a relaxing Sunday brunch And at 45 per person I expect excellent food and a good atmosphere If you do decide to go make sure to call ahead and make reservations It s definitely popular but after going there I m wondering why 
cZZLO3yAlZ1eK10MFGBqSw Urbana Chinese I took my parents They both seemed to like it My mother raved about her entr e which I believe was beef fried rice She also enjoyed the fried pot stickers though they weren t all that thoroughly fried obviously steamed and then quickly fried on one side I wasn t too hungry and just had the crispy tofu which was excellent as many others have said Held up well the next day for lunch too We ordered a mix of things from the translated menu and the American menu I didn t find the order process to be complex even as a first timer Grab a menu find what you want write it on a piece of paper go up to the counter Not rocket science We grabbed a table first which made things a bit easier 
c_5CW8JPWMNQO8LgfFFcUg Urbana Chinese After coming back here for the pho Vietnamese noodles I have to upgrade the rating to 4 5 stars or basically rounded up to 5 Hungover after a night a the bars the gf recommended grabbing pho at Mandarin Wok I never even knew that this super Chinese restaurant would offer Vietnamese noodles let alone if it was authentic or not Surprise Surprise The pho was EXCELLENT Far exceeding the likes of legitimate Vietnamese establishments in the Champaign Urbana area I would venture to say that it rivals the pho I get back home in the San Francisco Bay Area but that s probably because my pho addicted brain craves any substitute although the Yelper in me looks for quality and authenticity Soup base was flavorful noodles chewy meat offering varied and delicious And they even bring the bean sprouts herbs and jalapeno slices You will not be disappointed coming here for a hot steaming bowl of pho If you ve never had pho in your life consider trying it at Mandarin Wok a first step to something incredible Caveat only order the beef pho as according to another Yelper the seafood pho is whack 
D-cpIMX-LHHCfrp1oR3fwQ Urbana American Went here for din din with my broey and his wifepoo since they live in the area Food was fantastic Service was spot on our waitress was very attentive and took great care of us We had a flight of the many beers they offer the menu is extensive and it s hard to decide But one thing is 1000 worth getting Beer Battered Asparagus That s it Who cares if you have stinky pee from eating asparagus totally worth it 
d4yReMMcdMyvfwK-ThipGA Urbana American This is a review of the Sunday brunch which is AWWWWESOME I usually try to get a group to go to brunch every couple of months and we always come here There is so much on the buffet ranging from a waffle station omelette station salads veggies pasta salmon shrimp potatoes a carving station and an absolutely wonderful array of desserts to choose from I walk out of here feeling stuffed for days While the cost is not cheap I think it s around 19 including a beverage it is well well worth it I have tried the other top Sunday brunch place in Urbana and Silvercreek blows them away 
d6jookVxskbGIron0mDQ1Q Urbana American We really wanted to like this place We are local we eat and shop local we want to support local business So we had a bad meal the Ruben was terrible I did not know corned beef could be so bad and the bread was worse Anyway I thought to myself that even in my own place we make mistakes and once in a while the best customer ends up with a poor meal So we told our waitress why we did not like the food we had eaten maybe a 1 4 of the food served if not an 1 8th Anyway she said Ok and left That was it It was Ok with her we were served a poor meal Food is not good Servers are not well trained or managed Decor was nice for a quick service restaurant Highly over priced for the quality of the food served With so many other wonderful local choices Black Dog s BBQ Crane Ally Timpone s Pizza Rick s Bakery Cheese Crackers Sandwiches and Chocolates I have no reason to ever return 
d6XSEmrLzKFWOVOtYwcQEg Urbana Chinese i ve only ever ordered the orange chicken but it was damn good and they had it ready in less than 10 minutes for carry out this could be good or bad i don t know but it still tasted kick ass 
d9ia3CbqUbyOWQ7l0HBSaw Urbana Chinese I really enjoyed the authentic Chinese food I had at lunch here The food tasted good and the service was very friendly and helpful For the uninitiated there are basically three menus here I think that maybe if they stuck to one menu they d get better ratings The best menu is their authentic Chinese menu This is on the wall to the right as you enter It is in both Chinese and in English but includes almost exclusively authentic Chinese dishes The dishes I had were off this menu were cooked by their Chinese chef and were excellent high in flavor good textures I d eat them again anytime The second menu is on the left as you come in and this is mostly Americanized Chinese foods I think these may not usually be cooked by their Chinese chef but instead by their non Chinese workers The third menu is the menu of Thai items The owner is Chinese so while I haven t actually ordered from the Thai menu I wouldn t expect great things from it The decor in the place is typical unpretentious Chinese which is to say plain and frayed at the edges Disposable plates and cups don t make much for ambiance but most inexpensive but authentic Chinese places focus on the food and not the decor I deliberated on whether to give them three or four stars but ultimately I ve going with four because I did really enjoy the food I had and the service was very good Order off the authentic right hand side of the wall insist you want it cooked authentically and I think you ll go home happy 
DA4MV1vNT9UP0AJ0Xj2JwQ Urbana Chinese I worked here for a few months August until two days ago I was fired on a very contrived reason I think it was because this place doesn t get enough business Location is pretty bad for visibility even if it s convenient to campus Food is very average but I like it more than say Panda Express My parents run a restaurant so I have experience which is why I was hired in the first place this is one of the most inefficiently run restaurants ever The vegetable dishes are good though and the Chinese language menu is generally good quality if you don t mind a wait The bosses both cook when necessary but it s best to come during weekdays when the main cook is in The hot pot is also fairly popular but most of the meats are frozen Other things that are frozen include the Wheaten Foods menu potstickers wontons and meat buns I think that s pretty SOP here in CU though Portion sizes are okay They definitely shrank in the 3 months I worked there I won t analyze pricing because I m not used to eating out but I think most people consider them fair or just slightly overpriced Things to not get include the highly Americanized items on the menu especially those with breaded chicken in them The quick lunch was phased out mostly now it s a selection of two Chinese braised dishes so they keep pretty well and have an average turnover Instead they now offer Combos which are your standard rice and a main dish with an egg roll They used to give a soda with these but now only offer iced tea hot tea or a small bowl of egg drop or hot and sour soup Don t get the soups including noodle soups or appetizers unless you really like egg rolls they re decent but nothing special Certain dishes like the pork with mustard greens P10 IIRC are frozen but I think they re probably okay if you don t mind them defrosting reheating via microwave The smoothies and bubble tea are a no no they re edible and not too terrible or so I hear but go to Evo s or some other place for these the slushies are okay if you don t mind a lot of sugar Most customers seem okay with the fish but it doesn t look too great to me aka it smells and fresh fish doesn t To qualify that last statement it doesn t reek like rotten fish but you can definitely get a stronger smell than I think is usual when you gut one I bass fish at home and clean my own catch plus while it s inevitable it s frozen and quick defrosted aka in the sink in a water bath with direct contact rather than through a bag Hardly sanitary Like some other reviews have stated they really do skimp as much as possible on ingredients equipment etc Ingredients come in on Thursday nights from Far East and I m not sure when other ingredients come in However I d say to come on Friday because they probably push the old vegetables on Thursday I only worked TR lunch and Sundays so I can t say for certain A few big points about the owners behavior which they also try to instill in the workers first they will try to dissuade you from getting something that they feel is too much trouble to cook at the moment never mind if they have all the ingredients ready usually this is because it s busy secondly they do cut corners as aforementioned Another thing that most people probably aren t too concerned about because they aren t very aware of it is the matter of the special soup They only give it to regular customers but more generally to any Chinese or Chinese speaking customers If you re not Chinese speaking proficiency or a repeat customer who asks tough luck I ve seen this attitude referred to on foodie blogs as soup Nazism A last point on their behavior is that they will lie about what they have and don t have especially when it comes to drinks or if they feel they re too busy to bother with your order Normally this happens with drinks they keep changing their Combo meals and they decided to stop giving sodas with them because they didn t want to stock up they will also refuse to make you a smoothie or other blended drink if they re busy Basically they have an undersized facility an undertrained staff one of the bosses in particular gets in the way more than he keeps things going an undersized staff and basically a very mediocre business model I m kind of astounded they ve survived but if you know what to get you can get a pretty decent meal here To conclude there aren t a lot of repeat customers but they try to treat the ones they recognize well However I went to Cravings with a friend yesterday and I saw a lot of former customers that stopped coming there I d say they made a good choice Cravings has much better service food and atmosphere Other good Chinese restaurants in the area in no particular order include Mandarin and Lai Lai The Wok in Mahomet is legendary among the Chinese on campus but that s another story 
DG8_DN8UExCtcpAKCZYqHg Urbana American My husband and I went here for the first time for our 25th wedding anniversary dinner We decided to go to Bacaro on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend thinking it would be nice to avoid the crowds on a Friday or Saturday night It is a beautiful modern looking restaurant When you walk in there are two rooms the first room behind the hostess stand has more room and tables are further apart The second room to the right behind the hostess stand has the long bar in it and tables are very close together down the left side of the room one long banquette sofa on one side of the tables The 3 or 4 tables in front of the window in this room were all taken already We had high hopes for the restaurant given the reviews we d read heard and that it has been open for quite a long time would seem to be a tried and true restaurant My hobby since high school 20 years ago has been finding going to good restaurants at home and travelling But first strike happened right off the bat with the hostess Apparently they were not seating in the first room she showed us two tables one not cleaned off in the middle of the seating on the left and the other in the very back corner next to an already occupied table Since it was a special night we really didn t want to be shoved in a corner so we asked for the middle table Wonder why she wouldn t have cleaned off the table first and then asked us which one we would like The tables are uncomfortably close together a group of 3 was to our right No one was at the two tables next to us Second strike instead of trying to give people space that was available the hostess set a couple right next to us instead of a table over We found out later that the next room did end up being used and we could have had a table with much more room privacy It was awkward all evening being that close to two other tables Third strike it was apparent very quickly that the restaurant had only two waiters handling the whole restaurant I don t know if someone didn t show up or if it was poor planning Maybe they thought it would be a quiet night and that two would do it We could tell our waitress was harried from the moment she arrived at our table and as I watched her throughout the evening she never stopping running from the kitchen throughout the room I m sure she was one tired girl by the end of the evening Fourth strike we don t drink and ordered ice teas No sugar offered and she was so busy we hated to even bother her Finally at some point we managed to sneak in the ask But why did we have to ask Fifth strike three of the items I was interesting in choosing from for my entree had mint in them I am not a big fan of mint so when the waitress came to take our order I needed to know if I could have the kitchen hold the mint on whatever I ordered She said she could check but then waited to take our order which I really couldn t give until I knew the answer Awkward moment So after hem hawing a moment she finally headed to the kitchen to ask I felt bad because I knew she was harried and didn t need this and I didn t want to make the chef s mad i e soup nazi but at the same time if I m going to pay close to 100 for a dinner for two surely I can ask Later the lady at the table next to me also had a special request for the kitchen which made me feel better Fortunately they were able to accept my request The dinner started off with an amuse bouche of a tiny square of frittata It was cute one of those fun things you get at nice restaurants but just okay I wished I had ordered the heirloom tomatoes as a starter but got flustered because of the above we both ended up ordering a salad w goat s cheese and peaches The peaches were heavenly deliciously ripe sweet and juicy my husband ate every last bite of his salad but mine had too many stemmed pieces of lettuce so I didn t do as well Sixth strike I had ordered the shrimp risotto and my husband had ordered chicken I noticed on the menu that it was 28 and thought hmm Mine was fine not blow me away good which was too bad because risotto I had recently at Silvercreek was WAY better but husband s chicken well you know that credit card commercial on tv where the couple goes out for a nice dinner and they get so little food they go out for sandwiches afterward That s the kind of dinner my husband had at Bacaro It arrived on a large white plate with nothing on it but a sliced chicken breast a chicken leg and essentially a chopped garnish of picked corn bacon etc And NOTHING else He was stil hungry after he ate it He was already asking what would be for breakfast that night when we went to bed because he was still hungry I read someone else s review on Yelp that also said 28 for chicken yelp says I m out of space will have to finish in another post 
DIf4va7ztN-OcbspNg12WQ Urbana American With its scarred wood tables friendly staff blaring sports games and dim lighting Murphy s is a local institution It s also where history graduate students tend to congregate once a week huzzah The beer food specials are generally fantastic and the grimy feel of the bar is palatable after a drink or two One caveat they have the nastiest nastiest bathroom It s hideous Ugh 
DKJKoHE3vQkHPmYE7FYdEg Urbana Chinese OK here is the procedure for non Chinese folks 1 Walk up to the front desk and grab menus an order pad and a table number card 2 Sit down and pick something to eat You have 975 no joke choices of authentic Chinese Taiwanese dishes If you end up chosing sweet and sour chicken you deserve a slow fiery death 3 Write your entree number and the quantity figure on getting one entree per person and having leftovers unless you are super hungry You will get rice with the entree and return the order to the lady at the cash register who will take your money 4 That lady will give you glasses for water and direct you to where the tea is 5 Wait 10 min or so Don t fret they will bring your chopsticks and napkins 6 Enjoy the shit out of your yummy vittles Don t forget to share as no matter how freaking good your selection is whatever your fellow diner got is just as good I ve had the Salt and Pepper Shitake Mushrooms they are not on the menu but the lady at the counter knows what you are talking about and the Crispy Tofu as featured at http champaign taste blogspot com 2010 11 golden harbor authentic chinese cuisine html These two are freaking divine The tofu was the absolute best I ve ever had 
dKuyLKGJs_YGvWy-nm_FCQ Urbana Chinese My preferred place to eat Chinese on campus Although I will admit that I haven t eaten at every place around town there aren t too many great Chinese restaurants around here this does not include buffets Their General Tso s chicken is amazing Giant quantities for prices a bit on the high side but not too bad considering how much you get Anything bigger than a small and you re guaranteed to take it home in a doggie bag tray thingy are the trays seriously called doggie bags too unless you re sharing it with someone else I usually only order the General Tso s or Vegetable Lo Mein my default Chinese food preferences so I can t really say much about the rest of the menu but I did order soup there once and they gave me it in a giant bowl with a decent amount of noodles It tasted okay but not great It can get kind of crowded in there with limited seating and the atmosphere isn t too great but it s acceptable 
Dlmt75tLSGEwmCymLuDGfA Urbana Chinese AWESOME food and friendly wait staff The owner is so nice and always remembers me and my boyfriend when we come in and greets us personally We don t even go there that often The Chinese Eggplant in Garlic Sauce is AMAZING and the Scorpion Bowl drink is delicious and hilarious Comes in a Hawaiian themed bowl with a shot in the center that is on fire Yummy yummy 
DlrBMSFp44hdjRNDlQQLcw Urbana Chinese For very cheap and not AWFULLY bad Chinese food the regular cheap two sized small and large portions menu is barely and I mean barely OK However since they ve hired a new chef they put on more pretensions now they have some alleged Szechuan dishes which are quite a bit more expensive yet EVEN WORSE than the regular dishes The new chef is worse than the traditional chefs I ve seen there for years I tried two different dishes from the more expensive menu some beef which was edible but undermediocre and then a whole Szechuan bean chili whole fish dish which was so bad and literally stinky I couldn t finish it I should mention I love Chinese food and I had lots of it in lots of places The reason I still visit the place rarely is a cheapish and tasty Crispy Whole Fish in the regular menu which is not authentic Chinese but which for some reason I crave every three months The campus Chinese place to go is Lai Lai period There s simply no comparison in quality and when the ratio price quantity quality satisfaction is being taken into account Lai Lai offers by far the best deal on campus Compared to Empire Chinese Evo where the chef comes out of the toilet and back into the kitchen without washing his hands or even Mandarin Wok which has some OK dishes but not equal to Lai Lai 
DMbiHEJaRjCUIehlp8UgJQ Urbana American Best burger and fries in town hands down 
dMDJbeoZCkk0110nkk-fDA Urbana American Utterly fantastic food The chef is a genious on par with any of the best restaurants in town but at a lower price than some of the more expensive competition Not as nice of an atmosphere as some of the fine dining restaruants like Jim Gould s and Silvercreek but every bit as tasty Destihl is going to have a great impact on downtown Also while I m not a beer person the people I ate with said the beer is an excellent local micro brew Perhaps not amazing but just as much as any reasonable person could hope for Also they do have a meeting conference room with a large table and an LCD TV 
DMG4QV6fpXVAL_QpuR_UNg Urbana Chinese short on time not wanting to make dinner convenience of online order delivery 6 minute chinese tonight for dinner it was not good not even okay it was really kind of gross i ordered kung pao bean curd and literally it was just bean curd and sauce no peanuts no water chesnuts no veggies nothing just bean curd oh and sauce that tastes like sort of amped up sweet and sour sauce it was beyond gross i didn t even finish it i have an idea 6 minute chinese take an extra 6 or 7 shooooot i ll even wait 10 extra minutes and make your food edible 
dNA5HJMmSgszaQ-F2MsgxQ Urbana Chinese With so many Chinese food options on campus Mandarin Wok faces some stiff competition and unfortunately doesn t quite stand up to its competitors I have only eaten at Mandarin Wok a few times within the past semesters but every time has been somewhat disappointing Their soups and noodle bowls skimp on the meat and vegetables while their standard dishes are simply lackluster Portion sizes seem smaller than its competitors and for the price paid Cravings definitely has better value The menu is tremendously large and can be confusing with unfamiliar customers as well With almost an entire wall filled with an exclusive Chinese character menu it is recommended to bring along a native Chinese speaker to help decipher and select the better items While there might be fantastic dishes hidden amidst the heap of possible items Mandarin Wok for the unfamiliar customer is not a smooth stop by and eat type of place 
DnLcswwXbWA5-Z-G_gfItg Urbana American Bacaro is very hit or miss there have been times I have loved my food and other times where the food has been average but has been expensive Overall it is a consistently good restaurant in terms of service However there are certain dishes that are more tasty than others I would definitely recommend trying Bacaro at least twice in an attempt to determine the types of dishes you like and don t like 
dPutz6TGhw71PbaD-gXfcA Urbana American Great place It came to one point where the waiter started recognizing me and my boyfriend and didn t give us menus It is kind of like a Flattop but much better The salmon is so tender and juicy it s amazing In addition their prices are pretty great On Sundays it is all day lunch price which is a great deal for multiple trips to the food bar 
DRCj0b2e31vR-nAUBqoMpw Urbana Chinese Service was awful Sat down was asked to order not even 60 secs later and then was dutifully ignored the rest of the time I m Asian too but apparently no love there I had the three cup chicken and on a sudden craving an order of crab ragoon The chicken came out pretty fast in a one of those sizzling bowls yum I was pretty excited because it was drowned in delicious brown basil sauce and had large bamboo shoots I totally would have enjoyed it more if it wasn t obvious that the chicken was the normal breaded chicken breast bits used in every other chicken dish Chinese fast food restaurants have Three cup chicken should be made with chicken on the bone with the meat nearly falling off because it has been simmered lovingly Apparently my expectations were too high my bad The crab ragoon came out nearly at the end of the meal which caused me much confusion because I had forgotten about it Nearly burnt to a crisp but still fried wanton skins filled mayo can t go wrong with it I ll come back and with lowered expectations I am sure I will enjoy myself more 
drp4-x5g1jVCcisHBDNa_Q Urbana American This is another Mongolian Grill located near downtown that has a lot of good things going for it The things that were great were the selection of fresh vegetables and protein including salmon and shrimp The things I didn t care for were that I thought it was pricey but maybe I have grown accustomed to the student discount at Flattop Grill I went about 5 PM on a Friday night and it didn t start getting crowded until we left Service was very good but almost to attentive as we were at the counter creating our bowls I also thought it was interesting that none of the employees had recommendations on selections of sauces Also the person I went with asked for some simply soy sauce once we had creating our bowls and they had none It wasn t a major downfall as I found a sauce that was tasty Outside the stir fry you can also turn your stir fry into a soup or salad which I didn t do The bread that comes with was just OK in my opinion 
dSCbHWjQvcaOWb_E0KjTWA Urbana American I checked out these reviews before I went to Murphy s and was getting excited for the best burgers on campus HA It was tiny and my fries were more like hard sticks of oil While the atmosphere was cute the food left much to be desired 
dTltuTjxmAwEo0zz8kYzDg Urbana Chinese We went with someone who was a regular here and they pre ordered a lobster for us We had a 7 pm reservation and arrived at 7 10 pm We sat down and the lobster came out right away Yay Unfortunately it was cold and apparently was cooked earlier in anticipation of our 7 pm arrival Boo Who cooks a lobster before the guests arrive What if they don t show Then the owner blames us for being late And then we found a few pieces of pork in the lobster What The rest of the food was ok The braised duck was delicious but small portion The ma po tofu was good Stir fried bok choy hearts were good The stir fried beef was over tenderized and boring We ordered braised fish that came out steamed Again some pointless explanations and the fish was replaced with the proper braised fish Oh well a wasted night out out for dinner except for my fortune cookie You will inherit some money or a piece of land Good for me bad for someone else 
dUOMsweszu3XWIRLJlQp_g Urbana Chinese I ve had the Tom Yum Koong and the pad thai chicken and shrimp Unfortunately the soup was only ok The shrimp was very overcooked I ve had pad thai there a few times and it s pretty good but not the best in this town Would like to try some other dishes 
DvC1UtSjXg-nurzk_fHC2A Urbana Chinese The food is inconsistent Not the worst on campus but overpriced greasy salty nothing to compare to a place like Lai Lai The reason I won t go back there is that I happened to be in the restroom and I saw one of the chefs or the cooks not sure going out of the bathroom without washing his hands This is unforgivable I don t care how good their food could be but anyway trust me it s not as good as to be worth this lack of hygiene 
dysv0KBS_SiDZ2P7hlSwlg Urbana Chinese The food was great waitstaff was nice We had the crispy tofu and teriyaki chicken We talked to the guys who bus though and they said that if you don t bus your own table and leave a tip instead the bus boys don t get to keep it It goes to the owners So bus your own table 
e-aTsgDOfEBJDP-WU43JhQ Urbana American I have come here countless times over a 20 year span from when it was a little campus bar to its current ever expanding state Can t beat Wednesday night Bacon Mega Cheeseburger special night Usually good fries and the standard drinks A campus tradition with all kinds of stuff carved into the booths You can t graduate from UI without having gone there at least once preferably more 
E-k0z0lQu-H3LHTnj6Rpaw Urbana American The food at TBC is fine if you like moderately soggy vegetables and bland sandwiches They have vegetarian options that are okay more diverse than many places but the few times I ve been there the salads needed a little work It is a ok to tear the lettuce up a bit so people don t have to slobber it all over their faces I really hate a clunky salad The pear panini was satisfying and but the IKEA tables outside make me nostalgic for my own yard and my own cooking thus reinforcing my tagline Vegetarian with a touch of snobbery I don t rate restaurants on their administrative prowess but if I did I wouldn t give any to the TBC The waitstaff and management made it nearly impossible to process a reimbursement through the University of Illinois You would think given their proximity to campus that they would train people adequately with respect to how to handle the idiosyncrasies of receipt processing through the University Instead I am wasting my work and personal time chasing down the original receipt for a charge entered incorrectly by a waitress And the day manager can t help me Um I just recommend not going here at all if there is a chance you will need to then make your lifework sleuthing receipts Oh how fulfilling I ve heard other people say that it is always a nightmare to expense TBC meals The U of I area restaurants need to take a page from the book of vendors in other college towns and get their act together 
E-kykpZwCZur3OSaVc6f8A Urbana Chinese the reason I m giving them only 3 stars is that they are rude on the phone and always seem angry I only order delivery from them other than that the food is good and they deliver fast 
E0p4WS0LPOmrx1iatu3r4Q Urbana American Thanks to Big Grove we have a fine dining establishment that bases their menu on fresh and local ingredients I went there with my husband for our anniversary but I can easily see going back for a more casual meal or even for drinks and bar snacks Every table starts with slightly sweet popcorn and we were promptly visited by our friendly and helpful wait staff We had the chicken liver pate bistro filet house made sausage and the tater tots Everything we tasted was delicious I can t wait to go back and work my way through the menu 
E1FOIEKt83mfagTSU1S_Gw Urbana American I ve lived here for three years and eaten at probably every restaurant in Champaign and Bacaro is by far the best Bacaro has the best most professional servers the food albeit expensive is of the finest quality and the wine selection is unmatched in southern Illinois I ve eaten here at least 50 times and only had a handful of dishes that were not amazing and on that rare occasion the staff and chef were quick to make it right If you have a special occasion Bacaro is the only place in town you can completely trust to make the experience perfect The environment is very lively yet classy Make friends with your server and he or she will treat you like royalty every time you come in Thad the owner will bend over backwards to make sure you leave his restaurant happy and telling everyone about it Watch out though he may even get you drunk on fancy wine If you re new to Champaign and have the money you ll certainly want to become a regular here 
e1n0q4-hV0AN4QdUMXhZ1Q Urbana Chinese Despite what others say about Lai Lai Wok I actually like this place The prices are relatively cheap and the food is good The lady that works the cash register is really nice too I usually get the salt and pepper squid and fried pork chop over rice Everything is so flavorful and perfectly seasoned Did I mention it s cheap My family loves it too Always gotta stop by and get some takeout before I head home Make sure you stop by 
e4SboA9VEGz-59Ufm9H2DQ Urbana American Tried Prairie Fire for lunch today While there wasn t anything bad about this place there wasn t anything spectacular either I had the burger on a pretzel bun The pretzel bun was tasty and I would enjoy it again The burger was okay they didn t ask how I wanted it done so I expected it medium which it was but I would have preferred them asking what temp I wanted The chips were good but I would suggest adding cajun spice or something to make them more appealing The fries are not good The Garden Burger is actually tasty but nothing that would make me go back We might try it for dinner sometime Service was okay but they could be better 
e8-IRFiYaAdHSoX7geqetA Urbana American If all of the profs on campus hide out in a certain place you know it has to be good I always hear mixed reviews about this place from my friends but I m going to go ahead and give it a 4 This is my new favorite lunch place on campus for when you have time The sandwiches may be 1 2 more but are killer compared to other on campus options The grilled sandwiches may be a little buttery on the crust for some but it s perfect for me Last time that I went I got the grilled turkey sandwich which comes with caramelized onions and cheese Dinner options include fondue and pretty good pizza They also have some good bottles of wine on the list I ve ordered a bottle twice and been happy with what I got You might have to talk to one of the chefs if you want wine opinions since our server didn t seem to know much Really good atmosphere and decor it s casual fancy enough for pretty much anything and it s right next to Krannert if you need an after show dinner 
e8csEZTBHSwUXOi2gpW0pw Urbana Chinese fast you can get your food in under 5 mins cheap about 5 big portion sometimes you can get 2 meals really nice owner he works as hard or even harder than any worker there and is very nice to talk to Sometimes he even offer you free eggroll Now im not a big fan of eggroll but it is free food is ok you will get tired of it if you eat there everyday which I did for almost the whole month when I was preparing for my Qual exam but give yourselves a break and things will be back to normal again 
e9r3_8VXrzznPRTv8ZNORg Urbana Chinese Food poisoning worst taste of tea worst service Stay away from it for your life We a group of 4 entering Evo for some bubble tea We ordered coconut taro and boba The taste of them were terrible and we could even find the powder they used to make those tea Coconut tasted like some out dated milk and taro tasted like sugared water The servers were unhappy seeing us just order drinks not food and they paid us the worst service ever with so negative attitude The worst part is when we got home and prepared for dinner two of us got food poisoning They spent the whole night to calm the pain in their stomach and vomit nothing because they had no chance to eat anything else but those Evo tea Please let other people read this comment for the good of their lives 
EadvOWGgFYsu2tW8a4FeKA Urbana American This place is solid It s cheap especially for campus The menu varies day to day which keeps things interesting You probably won t love every dish they make but there s little displays so you have a pretty good idea what you re getting The prices have increased a little from what other reviews say to 5 an entree for lunch and 0 75 for sides But I think it is usually worth that Some things I ve had here Pastrami on marbled rye was quite tasty Maybe not quite as flavorful as the Beef Stand but cheaper and closer for me Fried okra is the best I ve had in town Yum FSHN chips sandwich I was a little disappointed in this one there seemed to be less fish than breading Beer battered cod and chips was pretty good Mushroom and turkey panini also pretty good and satisfying on a cold day Manhattan clam chowder I liked this a lot it had a tasty broth and many chunks of fish I ll have to try the soups more often Overall since there are multiple dishes it seems like there s usually at least one thing worth trying I ve never had the salads or desserts but they look pretty good Service has been good every time I went though obviously this depends a bit on the students working I ve been pretty happy with the food I kinda like the cafeteria style set up and the price is right I ll be coming back here to try out more of the menu Great for a day when you forgot your lunch or just need a break and some tasty grub Since I found it it has become one of my regular lunch spots And you can look the menu up online before you even walk over http beviercafe illinois edu index cfm 
EAsNPHnHzyk3s4DwfGMSbw Urbana Chinese Food is really good The ordering process is a bit complicated at first but you get used to it You don t have to pay for tip which is a big plus for a college student Portions are fair and the food is excellent quality The fried tofu is really good 
EbR3MUG4eAYDRWTithCSAw Urbana Chinese Golden Wok is by far the best place to go for noodles in town So far I ve had their Pad Thai Pad Kee Mow Pad Prig Pow not sure on this name and Ho Fun and they were better than anything you can find in Champaign Urbana That s not saying a whole lot but their Ho Fun is one of my favorite things to get when I eat out Their curries are also pretty phenomenal the meat quality isn t too great you can tell that they buy their meat except maybe for the duck from the big commercial vendors but the curry itself is exceptional If you do decide to go with the curry I d recommend the Panang as it s not loaded with vegetables as the other variations tend to be The Thai iced tea is also quite good Thai iced tea is one of those things that s almost guaranteed to be good anywhere you get it but as Christina F puts it it s well worth the 2 10 if you want a nice sweet closer on your meal Their lunch specials however are a little less desirable as it s pretty much the same as every other Chinese lunch special in town with the staple Beef with Broccoli Shrimp in Lobster Sauce Sweet and Sour Chicken and the like and it s honestly not very good I ve personally tried two or three chicken dishes for the lunch special decidedly giving the Wok another chance for redemption after each subsequently disappointing meal but they failed to deliver each dish being pretty much the same as the last but in a different sauce I also have to agree with the 2 star review that s also up here The Tom Yum Khai wasn t very good when I had it I ordered the Shrimp Tom Yum Khai and it tasted overpoweringly like shrimp and mushrooms you could barely taste the broth under the taste of these two ingredients Overall though I m willing to give Wok 4 stars because if you know what to order you re almost guaranteed to get a good and tasty meal 
eCdNm6d7NnMT2WdrAQ6HYg Urbana Chinese I came here again and requested General Tso s Tofu something not on their eat in menu IT WAS AWESOME I will never go to another Chinese food restaurant 
EcMZ0bJntBkBreboYHlcmg Urbana Chinese A little bit of home away from home A wide selection healthy portions cheap prices and consistently yummy Chinese food is why I really like it here Cravings reminds me of my mom s cooking which is always a great treat when I m feeling homesick or just get ridiculously sick of dorm food which is often They have a very extensive menu with something for everyone they have lunch specials for even cheaper chow and the owner is very friendly yay for discounts especially if you go often I would recommend any of their noodle or rice dishes I frequently go with Ma Po Tofu or anything with chicken and they cater all people from those on special diets vegetarians Americanized Chinese food think orange chicken to the more traditional dishes You can take out as with most Chinese restaurants but I ve always sat down with friends when I eat here Good eats 
ED0u36Qrx8I_pBRMKLulhg Urbana Chinese Overrated clap clap clap clap Overrated Yelpers I usually trust your judgment but you didn t get this one right Since I love small hole in the wall places with friendly owners this place meets those criteria this review is kind of hard to write but I have to do it The Mongolian beef that I ordered was cold Additionally it wasn t sweet and there were a lot of onions in the dish A lot The ingredients rice beef and onions were fine but I can t eat something that has been sitting around for awhile and isn t fresh and hot I ll try this place again because the owner is a nice guy but my first experience wasn t a good one 
EdbT-G3t1d3j_2dlC8wQeQ Urbana Chinese Debbie the manager of Peking Garden is always so incredibly courteous and kind to the customers She remembers all of their names and greets and hugs their kids too I go there all the time and it s such a nice refreshing change from many other restaurants with bad and distant service Not only does Peking Garden have great service but their food is so unbelievably tasty Try their crunchy wontons or egg rolls for appetizers they are always such a hot treat You can also ask them to make a dish with special considerations like make it non sweet and they never give you trouble for specific requests unlike other restaurants in town Overall it s a really nice atmosphere with private booths relaxing eastern music in the background and smiles for miles 
Eds0jSU7G0Ap178QOlhL-Q Urbana Chinese Food was okay The smoked tofu with celery and pork shreds was okay but underseasoned The spicy boiled beef was also just okay Not terrible we ate the whole thing but nothing to write home about either Not thrilled with the obvious clumping from excess corn starch either They do have lots of space and can be good for groups and their milk tea with boba was good I d go again but it s not worth going out of your way for by any means 
EEgLPYmpLQTa74IzC4SOJA Urbana Chinese Between here and Lai Lai Champaign has some very good Chinese choices on campus Not to say that the other local choices aren t good as well but these two restaurants serve some of the more classy authentic Chinese dishes that you wouldn t expect other restaurants to serve Fortunately for the students these restaurants cook well enough that there is no immediate need to run to Chinatown to enjoy good Chinese cooking Don t miss the tea smoked chicken here Although it s not as friendly to non Chinese and usually very busy don t let that deter you from visiting this gem 
eeuvfcpOQG5uqwwVza6igg Urbana Chinese I can overlook a slow delivery order that mixed up crab rangoon with egg rolls but the final straw was getting bubble less bubble tea We ordered it and it came out as basically a sugar slurry I asked the people working there where the bubbles were and they said they didn t have any Would have been nice to know before I ordered 
EfNZmhTNtFMrZaiPplUsWw Urbana American I went here for lunch with a large group I thought the menu selections were unique and gourmet We ordered the Fried Asparagus and they were lightly battered and fried to perfection Delicious My friend is Gluten Free and they have a menu just for GF items she had some type of pizza that looked and tasted delicious We didn t have any alcohol it was a work lunch so I can t speak to that 
EgpDLxgIOy6pXi1HrpPpOg Urbana American Tried it for the first time last night Had really good service It s a really nice atmosphere The food was fresh and there were a lot more meat options than I had expected Salmon crab shrimp They ve changed their dinner options to one bowl and unlimited I got the unlimited Tried a noodle soup with shrimp and warrior sauce It turned out so good and then got noodles with chicken with a combination of the peanut and chilling sauce Definitely going back I want to try their appetizers They looked so good on the menu 
egXcFzG50t0I60e04tbhgQ Urbana Chinese I used to live above Empire so I became very well acquainted with their food Their food is amazing best Chinese food I ve had hands down The shrimp in their Shrimp and Broccoli dish was my favorite most Asian restaurants give you very small low quality shrimps but Empire s are big jumbo shrimps and are good quality After graduating from U of I and leaving the area I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant like it 
EGzywHgVxSQh5VgeuXZkwA Urbana Chinese I love love love Golden Harbor So delicious and definitely AUTHENTIC Chinese and Taiwanese food It is not unusual for there to be a wait so call in advance if you are traveling with a large party The menu might be a bit hard to navigate so if you have someone in your group who can read speak Chinese that will help make the experience much easier Regardless the management is really nice and they have been always happy to help customers with the menu or make suggestions The crispy tofu ah so good and the soft shell crab in garlic sauce yum and the lion s head not actual lion heads but three giant meatballs so juicy and flavorful actually everything that I have had there has been absolutely delicious and I am convinced it is the best Chinese restaurant in the area Go with a large group of friends so you can order a bunch of dishes and share family style When my family visited campus for graduation they definitely approved What is especially refreshing is that in spite of the boast worthy food neither the food nor the service is pretentious in the least bit Golden Harbor thanks for the delicious food good service and great times 
EiAKca5n3Vs0Cp3RN4eArg Urbana Chinese I go at least 1 every 2 weeks I LOVE THIS PLACE I am addicted to there Jakarta Fried Rice I always look for it when I go to other places but they don t have it If they do have it they don t come close to Cravings version Their menu is really big Everything that I have tried I liked I like that people speak Chinese it gives it an authentic feel 
EJFZg9MF0JptMbcWdJ6zmQ Urbana American If you have to drink on campus and you re over 18 I guess you have to drink at Murphy s Bad rude wait staff ok bar food and god awful teeny crowd after 7PM on pretty much any night I haven t been there since the addition so I have no idea if that took care of some of the overcrowding problems I sincerely doubt it did anything about the disgusting sticky floors 
eMCUWYTv9YvEDNhkDJD59w Urbana American Four girls squeezed into a booth Cue a movie waiter My friend named our waiter as someone you would see in a comedy movie or sitcom talkative funny ish and always popping up at random times for small chat Needless to say our server was very attentive e g good at recommending not recommending dishes clearing the table He skated the annoying line very closely never crossed it though so hurrah Food got thumbs up from us Med pizza really delicious and big for 9 Bison burger fries were a hit jambalaya and dopple chop it was good but pricey at 20 for what is received Drink wise Belgian pale ale ugh no a bit of an off taste torched cherry caiprissima too much lime juice for me but my friend loved it and don juan nice Overall a good experience But not a place I would have cravings for or feel the need to re visit It felt like a safe night out dinner Plus you can wear what you d like I saw fashions of all kinds without much judgment 
EPDlrMsTJeGn-UfMHdYGQQ Urbana American Come here regularly for lunch but never knew it was such a nice place for dinner The original plan had been Timpone s but apparently despite their website and store sign saying they open at 5 PM they somehow decided they wouldn t open till 5 30 and since I was too hungry to wait around for 30 minutes the excruciatingly loud construction out front did not help either I settled for Bread Company They re usually a soup and sandwich place during lunch but for dinner they completely switch up their menu filet mignon duck breast tapas and fondue On CAMPUS The food was absolutely delicious if slightly pricey 15 20 for an modestly portioned entree but if paying 20 some will get me amazing bread salad ahi tuna steak bread pudding and a mint iced tea all without leaving campus well then I m sold P 
Eq3RI5hbviopgD5doEHT1A Urbana Chinese I ve been living off Cravings these past 2 years literally They have a big menu so the tip is you know what to order Don t just try something randomly as you might have a negative experience The owner is very nice and every time I ran into him in Champaign he always remembered me and said hi to me Dishes that I recommend include hot spicy chicken my go to dish I had this like everyday last spring mapo tofu really good spicy and only 6 50 for a very generous portion gado gado chicken nutty and sweet masala fish crispy and spicy fish fillet beef pan fried chow fun stir fried beef with large noodle really good Sizzling chicken pot I have to stress it it s SIZZLING chicken cooked with basil and onion Pepper and Salt Squid apparently everything starts with Pepper and Salt ___ is really good Try pepper and salt fish also Some more Chinese dishes that I like black mush room tofu w groundpork basil pork with rice bean noodles with ground pork a lot of people asked me what I had when I ordered this dish hot sour seafood noodle soup tom yum based with LOTS of seafood perfectly for a cold day these 4 dishes above can be found on the white board near the counter The Mongolian beef is good but it s not consistent I like it to be a bit overcooked but sometimes it s still a little rare to my liking especially during peak hours These dishes are all from the Chinese menu since i m not a big fan of Americanized dishes in general

eT3m0zEJN1lh02c4ZMIJxQ Urbana American I went to Silvercreek for lunch today with my dad and I feel like it s undervalued for lunch I had pesto rock shrimp pasta 8 25 and the most expensive lunch item and though I wish the menu had mentioned it was a light pesto cream sauce it was delicious and the garlic bread was awesome My dad had their burger of the day and he loved it too Our waitress was a little spacey but that ll happen Our entire meal including drinks and tip was still under 25 you can get a bill higher than that for lunch at places with far inferior quality of food 
Etp_XbboaShLaanySaGPyQ Urbana American The cookies here are amazing Especially the White Chocolate Pecan They are so rich and delectable I also had the South Western Fiesta Turkey and Corn Salad and the daily special which was Chicken Gumbo It all cost about 11 which is more than I was expecting to pay but I was very full The Salad was great And I NEVER like salads I generally go out of my way to pay extra for an alternative but I noticed that the salad today looked pretty good and I was glad I made that choice It was chock full of fresh vegetables juicy chicken and great taste The salads here are wayy bigger than the entrees I was not impressed with the Gumbo I can t put a finger on it but I have to say that the overall flavor was not appealing 
ETqmHWvVPScRKp--sRd25w Urbana American Warm popcorn in galvanized micro buckets greeted us with a wonderful crunch and delightful nibble while our beers arrived the deviled eggs were a true highlight Service was wonderful and there was an understated elegance and relaxation in the staff and the atmosphere Tiny smelt breaded and fried with lemon mayo were a hit the wonderfully seasoned pork belly with grits melted like chocolate as it entered my mouth However the special pork shank and beans seemed a bit of a miss and the mac and cheese although quite tasty was so large and rich and hot that it was difficult to enjoy maybe it could be a small appetizer side The chef at Big Grove definitely puts out quality tasty food that re imagines the standard Midwestern menu I applaud that However some of the details were slightly troubling out of draw item burger at 7 00 PM slight gaffe on menu These beers one dish that didn t quite work 3 5 
ETxEwpUHUK3HtZyF0Sbrmg Urbana American I still have dreams of Wednesday lunch Bacon Mega Cheeseburger and Fries for 4 I would give my left arm for a Murphy Burger on some days 
EUPzM2wJPFWmOlNvHcgVeQ Urbana Chinese Every time I came to visit one of my best friends while he was in school here we d make a trip or two out to ECR for their amazing General Tso s Tofu No other Chinese place I ve ever been to has made this dish as great as ECR The portion is always huge and I bring home leftovers It s also inexpensive well lit and the people who work here are incredibly sweet They also offer free hot tea and water during your meal We always found a place to sit whether it was just the two of us or with a larger group of people I really wish I had this place nearby I miss it Yummmmm 
evway_Esgf7LTewxHha4mg Urbana Chinese 2 things to order Jakarta fried rice and hot and spicy chicken 
EWSvwvA5wZVDyV-ePCG88g Urbana Chinese I ve only been here during lunch hours when it s almost completely empty for their dim sum The dim sum isn t bad for somewhere not in Chicago but it s obvious that most of everything is frozen and re steamed Prices aren t bad either about the usual prices for dim sum They might be the only place on campus that makes real fruit slushies with boba Evo uses syrup yuck Other than that the regular food is nothing special and rumor has it this place is closing soon since no one ever goes there anymore But that s just a testament to the ownership and the so so food If you want dim sum you can always go to Saigon 
EXlFXL_whsh2-PHFaTgTYQ Urbana American This is my favorite of all the campus bars hands down Every Thursday night during the school year a club I m in takes over the basement pool tables darts and all to hang out in I can t even count all the great memories I ve made there Unfortunately on Friday and Saturday nights the lines build up pretty fast so it s best to get in before it gets packed In terms of food drink great fries great specials on drinks 2 Woodchuck Thursdays 
Ey7C0PfQrbQVI8RYloZVbA Urbana American I love the Destihl in Bloomington Normal so I had to give this one a try A co worker and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night The place was not overly busy but had plenty of business I really liked the decor of the place and the booth setup was neat Our waitress was very helpful and friendly I was happy to see that they have the same menu as the one in Bloomington Normal with only their beer selection being different We started with the Beer Battered Asparagus which was delicious I was tempted to get my usual the White Cheddar Stuffed Poblano Peppers but decided to change it up a bit I went with the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout It had wonderful flavor My co worker got my usual and she loved them too We decided to go for dessert as well I ordered the Creme Brulee I was not very impressed by this It was a bit on the runny side and I am used to creme brulee being smooth and creamy Overall great food and service Love this place 
EZMJWN3Qq9w-wQVMaXUhaA Urbana Chinese I think this is my favorite Chinese Taiwanese eatery in Campustown I first thought it was a slower but higher quality and price restaurant but I was wrong in a good way First the food quality is indeed good I chose the Mongolian beef with broccoli and the chicken with snow peas The sauce was good not too thick or not too soupy and the broccoli was crisp and not too cooked The chicken with snow peas was really a pleasant treat as well The veggies rivaled the taste of the chicken always a good sign The food came out surprisingly quick and the price was almost as low as the lesser quality places nearby I regret I did not take advantage of Lai Lai Wok more often while I was in grad school The food was better but it is kind of far away from campus as well but I think the food is worth it for sure 
F2UjTUgvjJI5O2Z8ovb-eg Urbana American I popped in here once for lunch last summer on the recommendation of my nutrition professor Our chat on carbs and training for races and triathlons led to you HAVE to go to the Bread Company Though this overly subtle carb stop doesn t have a sign anymore on its exterior it can be identified by the variety of wine bottles lining the window sills There s a variety of sandwiches for the lunch hour but I hit the Bread Company tonight and my do they swank it up for dinner Dim lights plentiful menu of pasta pizza sandwich options and extensive specials list including tapas Who knew I had the roast beef sandwich served atop roasted potatoes and a light salad I think all of the sammies are served up open faced so open your mouth and get ready for a carbolicious meal 
f60iOKW4cBqjV-fYFiSPlg Urbana American Big Grove is fine but that s all it is Unfortunately it just doesn t make sense to pay 15 for just a good hamburger If it were less expensive maybe more in line with Blackdog or Dublin O Neils prices it may have gotten 4 stars whereas those other restaurants get 5 stars and 4 stars respectively We started off with some deviled eggs that were good and a fresh baked pretzel that had an unappealing mustard sauce I ll take Gulden s over that mustard sauce any day I ordered the burger and my girlfriend ordered a chicken salad sandwich The burger was actually pretty good cooked medium with an egg and some onion maramalade on it The fries were decent but nothing to write about The chicken salad was just a terrible sandwich Maybe one small scoop of flavorless chicken salad on hard toast for 9 Get that thing off the menu Seriously People who order that sandwich will not come back The sweet potato chips on the side were pretty tasty though Overall not as great as I had hear though maybe the chicken salad ruined the experience You want a burger go to Blackdog or Farrens for a comparable one that costs half the price Want chicken salad better than this go to your local gas station and buy a pre made chicken salad All that said I ll give it another try 
FBRcx_4vvt7_Rsy5tFMoww Urbana Chinese I must preface this review by saying that for about 364 days per year I have no desire to eat Chinese food For about 90 of those 364 days I would say I actively dislike Chinese For one magical day however I must get my Chinese fix Today was that day A friend recommended Golden Harbor as the place to go and thus we went Honestly it s not your traditional Chinese restaurant In fact I would call it a cafeteria where they bring your food to you You don t really see a server except when the food comes You clear your own table or you pay them to do it It s kind of absurd how it s all organized At the same time it s Chinese food I would eat more than once a year I actually liked it and since Golden Harbor didn t really score any points for ambiance or any of that cute stuff it s four stars on the basis of food alone In addition when the rice cooker crapped out the manager apologized for the inconvenience and hooked us up with lo mein instead It s a little more expensive and a little more complicated to order but I would say the food is more than worth it 
fc4ZyKvdn3lwGuHSGJ2g3w Urbana American We have been to Silvercreek several times for lunch dinner and special occasions booked events in the greenhouse I ve always noted good service and the food is very good especially the house made breads This past weekend we tried the brunch for the first time and were delighted It is quite an extravagant lunch with MANY options and they were constantly refilling the trays so everything was fresh The waffles were fantastic light and fluffy the salads were fresh and the hot items were flavorful I was struck as a vegetarian with how many green vegetable options I had Brussels sprouts broccoli zucchini with cherry tomatoes spinach salad cucumber salad For meat eaters there were all sorts of coldcuts fish and seafood fried chicken beef and ham And save room for dessert there are almost as many dessert items available as there are main course so many cakes Along with tarts candy apple crisp bread pudding which wasn t very good the only thing I didn t like at all trifle and fruit This is the perfect place to bring visiting family or have a nice brunch out with friends Service for us was good though I did have a bit of a wait once for a water refill The only thing that was kind of surprising was the treatment of the line where the buffet is set up it s not ideal but it seems to work so so 
FDel1uyQ42pppJKsFTezVQ Urbana Chinese Best Chinese Restaurant around the Champaign Urbana area As a Chinese I am picky about the taste of dishes and Golden Harbor just can satisfy our tongues and stomachs If they can have better decorations it would be even greater Recommendations Taiwan Guai Bao Fuzhu Niunan Bao XO Baby Squids etc The fishes are also good Pity that I cannot type the Chinese names for these dishes that would be of great help for Chinese gourmets like me 
fDquTL_dSh-V-Ui7CcplmQ Urbana American Despite the lack of love for Destihl on Yelp I have to say I am besotted besotted bis tid Adjective 1 Strongly infatuated he became besotted with his best friend s sister 2 Intoxicated drunk Now I am currently the first definition of besotted with Destihl I LOVED my visit I went with Mr Husband and a Very Close Friend VCF before seeing a movie at the Art Theater Upon leaving I may have been the second definition of besotted Just kidding I only had one beer I swear my Yelp reviews make me sound like an alcoholic sometimes We went on a Monday evening around 6 We were seated right away Mr Husband and I had never been there and we were surprised how big the restaurant actually is it doesn t look that big from the outside Our waiter came over right away and gave us a nice little menu introduction I don t know why they ve made a restaurant based on the things I personally like but they did I wanted EVERYTHING on the menu Seriously I haven t had such a hard time deciding on what to order for quite some time VCF and I decided to split a small plate and an appetizer so we got the House Olives and the Bacon Egg Cheese deviled eggs For my meal I got the beer cheddar soup and the spinach salad VCF got the bison burger and Mr Husband got a special item a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries Food Very good but to be honest it could have been better If Yelp let me give 4 5 stars I would ve Everything was solid but there were a couple things that might just push it over the top For instance the house olives small plate It was agreed that it could be improved by serving the olives pre chopped not whole sort of a mix between an olive salad and a tapenade The deviled eggs were good but the yolk was just a bit stiffer than I would ve liked The beer cheddar soup was yum but the scallions would have been a little better more finely sliced The spinach salad was good but the maple in the maple jalapeno bacon dressing was a little too sweet and overpowered the other good stuff grilled portabella mushroom hell yes Another reason I m torn I love that they use ingredients from local places when possible and have put an emphasis on sustainable farming I m all for buying locally and supporting small farms and businesses On the other hand the way it s flaunted just strikes me as a tad pretentious Personal bias but still Service Another ALMOST 5 stars My only issue with our waiter was that he was TOO attentive Really friendly very knowledgeable about the menu gave good recommendations was able to tell us what HIS favorites are it drives me crazy when waiters have no idea what s good on the menu However he came by every 5 minutes or so I always have mixed feelings about that I like a server who is there when I need a water refill or a new fork etc but coming by too often just breaks up the conversation Ambiance Very cool Very big city I like it I also like that it s BIG Ample room between tables We chose a booth and it was perfect The noise level is ideal quiet enough to talk at a normal level loud enough that it doesn t feel like everyone in the area can hear what you re saying Dessert I can t tell you the last time I ordered dessert after dinner That NEVER happens I actually can tell you it was at my mom in law s birthday dinner in early October But VCF knows how to sweet talk me into sweets heh and our waiter was VERY convincing when telling us about the stout ice cream sandwiches which feature a housemade chocolate ice cream made with their own stout served on chocolate brownies Oh Mah Gah SO GOOD The stout ice cream was phenomenal The dessert consists of two sandwiches so you get four brownies and two scoops of ice cream This would be great to 5 out of 5 stars for the dessert Price Another 5 out of 5 stars I was expecting that I d have one entree and a beer We ended up with a ton of food For 38 77 before tip I saved my receipt we got A soda A 12 oz beer the Malius Apple Blonde Ale so good House Olives app Spinach salad Soup Bacon cheeseburger special 1 2 of the stout ice cream sandwiches So while I can t yet give Destihl a best of the best rating I m definitely a fan and certainly willing to give it another few tries I don t want to deter anyone from going here because my visit was truly enjoyable I m already planning to permanently take Jim Gould out of my date night lineup and replace it with Destihl I just want to acknowledge that there is some room for improvement I think with a tiny bit of tweaking Destihl could easily be one of the top restaurants in C U 
fG-FBcCIRak6-LLugVePGw Urbana American Destihl is an upscale pub style restaurant with a low key atmosphere The menu is quite large and has a lot of variety from small tapas style plates to salads pizzas burgers steaks entrees and even some thai fusion style dishes Because of the variety I think this is a great place to bring a group or a date if you re not sure what type of food they prefer Also the food ranges from The beer is all brewed at Destihl and is decent but I ve never been blown away by any of their brews I have been here several times and my favorite dish so far was the Cedar Plank Salmon On my most recent trip I ordered the Kobe Burger and when I ran out of sauce the server asked if I would like more I am not a dessert person but I LOVE their dessert menu So do yourself a favor and save room for dessert Be warned if you sit in the bar area be prepared to wait I have actually left a few times when I haven t been given water or a menu 15 minutes after arriving If you sit in the main dining room however the service is superb
