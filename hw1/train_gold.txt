--XkN-1yQJjledUAH6BO1g CMU The necklace was fixed within the two week period they promised though they never did contact me when it was ready I had to be proactive and call them A final wrinkle was that their weekday hours 11 30am 5 30pm are really inconvenient for people who work The restringing job was ok though right now the beads don t line up straightly They said that this is an artifact of tightness from the restringing and that it should go away I hope they are right They put on a silver clasp which surprised me a little because I had assumed it was going to be gold the old clasp was gold We didn t discuss it before hand so I don t think they did anything wrong Still my overall experience was not entirely satisfactory 2 5 stars 
--zIkq5bERlrhFBgXOQwaA CMU Black Bean is one of those restaurants where you can eat if you re in the mood to really really splurge on calories At least I have to assume this because the food we got though delicious was supremely greasy which clearly added to the deliciousness despite what my arteries may have thought This place strikes me as a primarily take out restaurant as we were there in the evening and saw many people stop in to pick up food but only one or two other people actually sit down for dinner That said they do have a reasonably sized seating area and what appears to be a full bar so eat in is definitely an option You place your order at the counter and then it is brought to you at your table We wanted to sample a few different things so we got the croquetas and papa rellenas appetizers to start Both were really amazing croquetas are the equivalent of cheese sticks with ham inside instead of cheese The papa rellena was a ball of fried mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef Do you understand how as my tastebuds cried out in joy my arteries cowered in a corner Since these were such heavy appetizers we split dinner deciding finally on the fried chicken platter It s a light fry very well seasoned and tasty and not dripping in grease the way a KFC fry does However your plate comes stacked with rice beans or black bean soup which we tried and tostones which are twice fried green plantains Again delicious but heavy Service was good and the churro dessert despite taking a little while to get to our table was decent Four churros for 2 95 The prices were really reasonable here as well and everything is available for takeout Apparently this is a small franchise with all of their other locations in Florida so don t be like me and get your hopes up of seeing flan on the menu as that s only in the Florida locations All in all it s worth a stop in There very well may be healthier options on the menu but we were quite pleased with our unhealthy but tasty choices just the same 
-0JWaJMwpc2odCUjObVdcg CMU Love their gluten free pizza This place is a godsend for those of us with gluten issues Crust comes from the Gluutenay bakery so you know it s right They are careful to use a separate cutter for the gf pizza Thank you thank you thank you 
-0PQ7sPlGn0x6_s2R-oSyw CMU I love Jimmy Johns It came to a point where I had Jimmy Johns every night for 2 weeks The vito is awesome and I love their totally tuna The bread is what makes the sandwich though and oh man it is awesome Jimmy Johns probably has the best sandwich bread that I have ever tasted and I know my sandwiches 
-32Xo_dYoDTqc_Ev2C_adA CMU I ve had pizza from Say Cheese quite a few times and was always floored by how tasty it was Believe me I ve had a fairly extensive sampling of different pizzas from all over Pittsburgh as a college student at CMU and Say Cheese was hands down the best pizza I had in my four years there if not in my whole life but then again I ve never had pizza in NYC or Chicago so EXCUSE MOI if you happen to be a pizza snob Every part of their pizzas taste fresh and delicious and I especially love the crust of their traditional pizzas thick and doughy They have pan and Sicilian pizzas calzones and lots of other offerings on their menu too Their prices are also very budget friendly and they have free delivery And I just looked at their website and it looks like they now accept PlaidCash CMU dining bucks WHAT I wish I were back in college Okay not really But I d definitely stop by Say Cheese if I m ever in da Burgh again Nom nom 
-3m2MMQiCRDqR2CogrDP8w CMU A really unique building especially an educational building PROS The Nationality Rooms that surround the first floor There are 27 Nationality Rooms 25 are actual classrooms and the remaining 2 are sort of behind the ropes You can look in but you can t go in The Great Common Room the center first floor area of the building is amazing if you look up The architecture is just so fascinating that it s really cool that its a functioning building that is used by the students I spend many hours while school in this building Computer Labs Theater Cafeteria Food Coffee Cafe on the basement level CONS Can and does get quite crowded during the peak school season obviously The computer lab is impossible during the school season bring your laptop and use the school s new Wireless Printing option TIPS If you need a quiet place to study just walk around the various rooms floors you ll find a nook eventually that is perfect and quiet That window on that one top floor is no longer left open so you can t sneak up and out anymore P 
-3tsL4h8eFkDLjufcJBB7A CMU I tend to be very particular about Indian restaurants as I can normally get really good Indian food from my grandma s kitchen So as this was going to be my first Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh obviously I was going to be a bit reluctant of giving praise Some coworkers and I decided to grab some dinner here a couple of month ago First of all you should know that its going to be difficult to find street parking around this restaurant Be prepared to look around and just drop off some people from your group so that everyone isn t deprived of a drink before dinner Once inside the place was small but not congested with a small bar area towards the front They played hit music from India as well Indian music videos across the vast array of flat screens plastered on all the walls Nothing fancy really just the flat screens made up the decor of this place My colleagues had all been here before so they all knew exactly what they wanted so I decided to go with the a staple at Indian restaurants butter chicken I asked for it spicy just to see if they could actually make it tasty as well as spicy without just adding extra crushed red pepper Also one of my friends loves to burn his tongue and digestive tract so he asked the waiter to give him a 15 out of 10 on the spice scale I threw a blank look at the waiter and he said okay The food came out quickly which was a good first sign Next came out the Naan At any indian restaurant you can easily tell the quality of the food by the naan Overcooked and burnt you probably should not come back Anyways their Naan was both well cooked and soft which was great Finally the food came out and the aromas were amazing and it was delicious I thoroughly enjoyed my dish which was flavorful saucy and spicy and the Naan only helped to bring out the well balanced dish Well this place definitely deserved 4 stars because it delivered the spice level that my friend was looking for as he was sweating during the dinner 
-4O_tHmRmFfFs_aFalRBpw CMU Not great Stale bread and the food was strongly over flavored I had a glass of wine and was asked if I wanted another and I said just a half glass which I ask for all the time and get The reply from the waitress was we can t do that and the same from the manager CAN T do that Terrible attitude more like WON T do that Well I WON T be going back 
-5c7aj52arqc1R67MUhAEQ CMU This is a wonderful place with very friendly people They stock a number of items that are not easy to find elsewhere and most importantly have absolutely the best fish anywhere in the city if you want to make sushi or sashimi my opinion not scientifically tested The prices are not low for this fish but the quality is really brilliant You can get salmon that is super dense with no muscular separation I have been told but have absolutely no evidence or sources to refer to that the folks at Tokyo and at UMI the big Burrito group sushi place right next door source from the same place In any case it is the only place I have found and perhaps there are others but none within walking distance that I would use to purchase fish for completely raw preparations 
-5F82kXM9cuq9AFvYrZM-A CMU Great great service and fast Sat down and in less than 5 minutes later the food came out Don t even care if someone in the back heated it up in a microwave for the price you pay it s worth it The food is pretty good and the portion sizes will last you for a few meals The food takes me home but a greaser version of home 
-5YweTc2f63alMWaHn-qOA CMU Pittsburgh is a funny city There are fantastic high end restaurants e g Tamari Spoon 9 on 9 11 etc but not so many medium to low end restaurants Well La Feria is the clear exception For 15 or less you can have an amazing Peruvian meal My wife and I are experimenting with vegetarianism I know we re missing out on a lot of yummy meals and La Feria is particularly great for us They always have 2 veggie specials that are great Last night I had this bean and pumpkin dish which was fantastic The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the staff are friendly so for a quick and tasty dinner this is the place to go 
-6DLz1IRdz5zpNRuC9DMNQ CMU I visited the 1947 Tavern on a Saturday night with five others We luckily had a reservation as the small space was pretty packed at 6 30 Our server gave us a run down of the specials and we proceeded to order drinks There were no bourbon drinkers at the table but my lady got a whiskey sour and later a shady cider both of which she enjoyed The first course of the table consisted of bruchette cheese plate mac n cheese and a cup of the soup du jour beef vegetable The bruchette had duck confit on it great flavor but the crostinis were a little soggy The peanut sauce was well liked by the table but the fruit jam was out of place and bland on the cheese plate I quite enjoyed the aged goat cheese as well as the pate The mac n cheese was just pretty eh It was served in a casserole dish covered by a parm crisp It lacked flavor and moisture and although i ate the entire cheese crisp it seemed odd I m not sure if it was intended to be eaten with the macaroni since it pulled off as one large chewy crispy sheet of baked cheese I was told the cup of beef vegetable was very good The entrees consisted of lamb burgers the fish special lamb pasta chicken and I got the lamb loins Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees and left full We all cleared our plates with the exception of the lamb pasta which was definitely the largest portion at the table Some notes on the main course My lady was not a fan of the buns used on the lamb burger The dish itself is two slider sized burgers on what looks like large dinner rolls The buns texture though reminded me of stale biscuit The fries and demi sauce were both tasty though as well as burger patties that came out as requested medium My lamb on the other hand came out about a doneness too far luckily I ordered it MR so they were still good The meat was about four chops worth of meat served off the bone The dish looked a little messy and lackluster because of this but I enjoyed the lamb roasted tomatoes polenta and sauce on my plate My sister got a MW steak which was cooked perfectly She really enjoyed it but said her scalloped potatoes weren t very warm and had an odd flavor After tasting them I believe they used a goat cheese in the potatoes for a bit of tang The steal of the night was the fish special which was a pan seared Hawaiian Escolar for 15 It looked good and the plate was cleaned pretty quickly In conclusion I should mention the staff did well Our server was a young lady that offered to answer any questions and checked on our meals promptly after they were served She refilled waters fast even though the restaurant leaves a carafe of water on the table for the guests She also brought out a plate of toasted crostini when asked for something to pick at our peanut sauce with while waiting for the main course which wasn t a long wait Sadly the tavern does not offer bread service All said and done it was pretty ok With myself not living in the city I can t say I will make my way back here anytime soon but I wouldn t be opposed to trying more of the menu sometime 
-77Mt73ipevSGb1u3CdFHw CMU When my friends wanted to meet up at 1947 I groaned because my experience there last winter was NOT good see original review However when my PIC Partner In Cuisine and I arrived last night we were pleasantly surprised to see that 1947 had a pretty nice back deck for warm summer outdoor seating Ok I thought Maybe at least we ll have some nice atmosphere When I picked up the menu I realized it was completely different The options were actually pretty decent looking and the prices were WAY better than I remembered especially the beer prices I ordered the fried chicken salad and I got a deliciously fried chicken breast on a bed of greens with a 1 2 of avocado It was pretty darn good The downside this time was the service The restaurant wasn t really that full certainly not at capacity yet it took almost 10 minutes to get a beer from one of the hipster wannabe waiters Sometimes it s good that even if you have a negative experience at a restaurant to go back and give it another go after a while I m glad the management made the menu and price improvements because my second experience there was leaps and bounds above my first They will definitely be given more opportunities to earn more stars from me if they keep it up Original Review Not a fan Our party spent more time and money at the this place than we should have The service was good but otherwise the food tasted like something my elderly grandma with no sense of tasted put together and the drinks were way way way too expensive With all the quality places to spend a Saturday night in Shadyside 1947 doesn t even rank 
-7jue7YOkdpxowJBHlaPcg CMU I took my family to Pizzutti s a few months ago for my mother s birthday I d never been there before but I knew the location was nice and we re all fans of good Italian food The reservation I had made was never put into the book even though I spoke to one of the owners on the phone and made the reservation The bread must have just been defrosted because it was still cold in the middle We waited at least 20 minutes for our food to come out from the kitchen They brought out the wrong dish for my dad which he promptly sent back When they brought out the correct dish we complained at which point the waiter finally offered to at least give my dad his meal free of charge All the staff we interacted with were less than apologetic about all the problems we had that evening Needless to say I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone 
-8ETP1iX_UbafqFtEtm3MQ CMU Thai Place says they re one of the 10 best Thai Restaurants in the US and the Pittsburgh City Paper and other magazines newspapers have rated them as one of the best in town I have no idea who is voting but that is ridiculous When I arrived to pick up my take out order I noticed the place was vacant except for two couples at two tables The dish was overpriced and the portion was very small 17 00 for a simple green curry w beef and xtra serving of rice The sauce was bland and very watery The beef was tough and the vegetables were way overcooked I ve lived in the area for over 10 years and I ve had their food a few times It s always disappointing After this meal I decided to create a yelp account and post my thoughts 
-9hA4YGRb_HFbdy3O5O8Fg CMU I was more impressed with Squirrel Hill itself than I was with Bangkok Balcony My friend and I found this place on a vegan s guide to Pittsburgh type Web site and they were open late so that worked for us We found street parking very easily I was disappointed that most of the clothing stores were closed because there was such a great mix of vintage and new fashions I digress I really liked the layout of BB how it s on the top floor and everything is modern without being sterile We both really liked the flatware they use here and that s something we almost never comment on They had a good selection of tofu items and I loved how they asked me to tell them how spicy I wanted my food on a scale from one to ten The food here is also more inexpensive than I would have thought seeing how packed the place was and how nicely decorated Overall it was good but I m biased I love Thai food so much that I could eat it all the time The reason I m only giving this place three stars is because we both felt a little sick later on in the evening 
-9jXE9VxESK4l8rYcgvaUg CMU Lots of pizzas and salads on the menu a decent looking wine list and some nice beers on tap including one offering from East End Brewing Company Big Hop There are some nice tables available outside on the porch and plenty of indoor seating and a bar The service was somewhat lacking they didn t even bring me silverware and the server seemed to run away when I tried to ask for a napkin I tried the asparagus pizza and crab salad sandwich Both were decent although not incredible and the pizza was definitely on the salty side I ll probably be back although I wasn t overjoyed with what I had 
-9TRxZWU8CCfm0s-ZlrpdA CMU Gino is a great barber he is on the pricey side but he has very steep rent and a landlord who could care less about small businesses thriving in Squirrel Hill I have never had a bad haircut here and he always washes your hair I guess when I add in the wash he is not that expensive 
-9XxujUKT7k1H74FSzfvqA CMU My fave local bar ever Awesome bartenders and staff with decent food and ice cold beer Fist pump for Long Island Iced Tea night I dig the local sporty vibe to the place It is also deceivingly spacious two levels upstairs is for eating and the ceilings are high the whole place is open and feels like a cozy cabin it s never too crowded or too loud but gets a nice draw of people Great place to watch a game throw some darts play some shuffleboard 
-AIkr_WSpXlXeYPi1VZ-dQ CMU This is a great place to eat at before you go to a play at the Benedum It s ideal for a small group as the place is small and very busy before plays If you can I reccomend making reservations beforehand 
-Ba28A5Gj8IyWMznM3hCJw CMU The food is great The beer selection is great the prices are amazing 
-bcpB1NPyqZhAGaxtG8jcA CMU High quality theater 3 companies Professional Student and Dance Wife and I subscribe to 2 of the series love it Good value single tickets are available for sale Check web site or call the box office 412 621 4445 ext 0 This evening we saw Umbrella Man world premier About the loss of a child and dealing with the event The husband fills his mind with the JFK assassination and 2 frames of film of a man holding an umbrella as the car passes historical events and interpretations of conspiracy theory devotees Meanwhile the wife deals in other ways 2 thumbs up 
-bcreRgXhbkyfe4fEHHCRw CMU So after my 2 stars everyone was horrified How did you not like it How did you give them 2 stars So we decided to go to back and give it another try We started with 2 drinks a glass of Riesling which was one of the best glasses of Riesling I have ever had ever I went on a wine tour of the finger lakes a few eyars ago and had almost nothing but rieslings and this was better J had the Sunny Day or something like that with tequila Definitely not good It was supposed to have a citrus flavor with it but it really just tasted like a cup of tequila Good tequila but not a god drink We started with the lamb riblets Amazing Excellent lamb flavor and a delicious rhubarb chutney I would have preferred more bite with the chutney but the lamb was really amazing I then had the salmon which came with turnips and swiss chard with a red wine reduction and a lemon sauce Nothing really blew me out of the water here except the lemon sauce It was perfect The salmon was cooked perfectly but what was lacking was the seasoning I think everything would have been perked up a bit with a little more seasoning J had the lobster ravioli which was the best thing ever I really think the ravioli was stuffed with an entire lobster the sauce I have no idea what the sauce was but it was delicious This was really really good I cannot go on enough about how really fantastic this was We also got the tallow fries with mayo They were delicious but probably not worth the heart clogging calories from using the tallow All in all this was a delicious meal and I am very happy that we went back for a second try 
-bDydurT_OQAlEsOmvoxLA CMU Took a couple of friends there recently It was a weekend afternoon so we didn t face what I hear is the usual crush of people PROs One of my friends was visiting from Italy and tells me that the pizza at The Porch is the closest he s had to northern Italian pizza EVER in the US I guess that s a good thing if you re looking for authentic Italian pizza I enjoyed the pizza thin crispy crust and NOT overloaded with toppings The sandwich and salad I had was fresh and crisp The service was okay friendly and prompt but the server did disappear and not check back after we had our entrees CONs Out of several menu items on both visits but that could be cost of serving fresh food I ll be back It s good to have a comfortable place like The Porch so close by 
-biaQ657CSkTDtS3v6Iz8A CMU Excellent service for a good price We had our locks changed after moving into a house in Squirrel Hill The locksmith was able to schedule an appointment a few days from when we called He arrived on time for our appointment and had all the necessary equipment for changing over three door locks including re drilling one door and changing the key on an odd patio door lock The gentleman was friendly quick and competent The process took less than an hour and cost about 150 
-bIXhh7YOXzzIkfCxJi-og CMU Okay so I m not a Pittsburgher by blood and I couldn t avoid all the hype about this place when I first came to college at UPITT In one word I would say that this place is a gimmick The fries aren t great the slaw is not coleslaw but vinegar ed and peppered cabbage meat portions are minuscule the only thing that s really good about the sandwiches is the bread which varies depending on when you go On a good day it s super fresh and soft Pittsburghers love french fries on everything that s the Pittsburgh way But there are better combinations and better places to get your Pittsburgh style cuisine Eat here to say that you ve tried it and then move on to new and better restaurants 
-Bpz0o6ujeT0wjq8C2woEA CMU I m changing my review after a bad hair cut that was not handled correctly I went in told her what I wanted showed a picture and she decided to barely look at it and totally ignore everything I said I said I wanted some short layers in the front and long layers in the back and I wanted victoria secret model hair Instead she took the opportunity to do whatever she wanted and I ended up with chopped off layers of one length on the sides and no long layers in the back It looked like I had 2 haircuts one that was shoulder length and the rest long Nothing was blended it just did not make any sense nothing about it was good It was horrible When I went back to get it fixed by her she just kept trying to defend why she did the hair cut and why it looked good Ignoring the fact that I was unhappy and I didn t like it She just kept trying to cover her ass instead of listening to my concerns The fix turned out ok but still not what I wanted in the first place I just wanted her to listen to me and stop making excuses And I thought the manager or head stylist should have come over to talk with me but that never happened The front desk girls were not friendly or helpful as well So I will never go back and I m sorry for suggesting this place since I only got a trim the first time I went here and could have had the same cut from anywhere 
-CEOGs3GAUdk_bUqmy5XUQ CMU Went back for a late night dessert and drinks It was busy and bustling for a Friday Night in Oakland The warm bread pudding was delicious Their alcoholic twist on an Arnold Palmer was great I applaud anyone who makes their own limoncello Sitting at the bar is fun on the kitchen side because you get to see all the action and feel the warm glow of their oven Servers are still very friendly of course I really got a kick out of seeing menus cut up and recycled as bar coasters Be warned though their bar only had the ingredients to make the cocktails on their menu Full bar isn t quite accurate It s probably due to space but I hope this changes I look forward to a nice gin cocktail on the outside porch on a hot day Small update went back for brunch again had the biscuits and gravy and a seasonal soda The soda was apple ginger and AMAZING I say again AMAZING The biscuits and gravy was too much food and made me feel like a glutton but that s my own dietary mistake I could only eat 3 out of the 4 homemade biscuits before giving up 
-DnZVGWCfysnZFSnJF3gsA CMU so far so good trendy AND tasty I have learned from some more experienced Yelp ers to always visit a restaurant at least twice before the final Yelp But I just went to legume a brand new restaurant in Regent Square and couldn t wait to Yelp about it Legume feels like it should be in San Francisco the unassuming brick front hides a light and bright interior Tin ceiling school house lighting botanical prints antique mismatched furniture a great ambiance I would live inside this place seriously They don t try to get away with just looking pretty this sadly often happens with new restaurants in pgh The food was quite good as well I had a vegetarian stew perfect portion size tasty and fresh along with the watermelon gazpacho which was spicy and refreshing Don t be fooled by the name either They have meat dishes too two types of steak on the menu when I visited Supposedly the menu changes all the time which is also reassuring Definitely worth trying and if you don t like it you can always cross the street to Dee s and get some hotdogs afterwards 
-EjzMuTbmnbatY4FTc2bhA CMU Love Crepes Parisiennes 
-eMf_tBvrosAVKSiyALyfw CMU What a waste of money Unless maybe you re wasted I had high hopes considering the novelty of rooftop dining in Pittsburgh For the price point the food and service should be a lot better The hostesses were rude refused to sit us in the booth and then immediately sat a couple in a booth right after us Server was sweet but painfully slow and never refilled our water The cocktails were no where what was described about 10 12 bucks a pop and zero buzz A couple that was seated a few minutes after us was finished with their main course 15 minutes before we even go ours And when we did it was very disappointing The guacamole was just mashed avocados no seasoning whatsoever The rice was clearly a mix like Zatarans or something and the beans were equally unseasoned and appeared to have been poured out of a can and undrained Really gross The shrimp in the tacos were well cooked but it was all downhill from there no flavor overcooked veggies and to top off two really thick and cold corn tortillas for each taco Having no flavor is the worst crime against Mexican food Being slow and rude the worst crime against service Really terrible place 
-fdWy2YBR0mrSWyqo0OapA CMU I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend for dinner We decided to come here after randomly seeing it featured on a repeat of Guy Fieri s Diners Drive Ins And Dives earlier in the week The outside is not too much to look at but the inside is comfortable Appropriately we were seated right underneath a Guy Fieri poster that proclaimed that the Veal Parmigiana as big as yer head As you would expect with food that large it seemed that everyone that was leaving the restaurant had a to go box We knew from the episode that they make their wedding soup from scratch daily and so started off with a cup of that It had a good taste to it and had much more chicken flavor than most wedding soups that I have had in the past The escarole as a green was also pretty nice For my entree I decided on having the Veal Parmigiana sandwich as I wanted to see how big it actually was while my girlfriend decided upon the lasagna Both portions were quite large with the sandwich being as large as advertised and I have a picture to prove it It actually ended up being so big that I could not possibly fit my mouth around it So I ended up taking off the top which essentially made it into two open faced sandwiches The bread was crispy while the veal was fried nicely and the sauce and cheese complimented the rest nicely My only complaint with it is that it was a bit dry and I think that some more sauce could have been helpful with that Even so the half of the sandwich that I ate tasted good My girlfriends lasagna also seemed to be a super sized portion as it filled up her whole plate It had a lot of ricotta cheese in it which helped to give it an overall flavor that I enjoyed Like almost everyone else that I saw we ended up leaving with some to go boxes as I still had half of my sandwich left and my girlfriend half of her lasagna The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future It was a cool little place in which you definitely get a huge portion size for your money and the food is pretty good too 
-Fn581LmjquGcguvSrH8mw CMU Chicken under a freaking skillet I tear up just thinking about it I almost never order chicken at a fine dining restaurant but heard rave reviews from a chef friend and had to try All of the other entrees simply disappear on the page now when I am at legume I dream about this chicken It is so simple and so perfectly executed The rest of the menu is very good as well I have had excellent pates and mousses and many other great mains fish and steak The only dishes I have been under impressed by are the soups which I have generally found bland The ambience in the dining room could be improved a bit It is just a little too sterile The bar on the other hand is an excellent space Overall an excellent restaurant 
-g4zUWbz0FZyWtVIvMM3vg CMU This is a must see if you are visiting Pittsburgh The architecture inside is amazing and in the winter time they even light the huge fireplaces on the first floor Give yourself some time to check out all of the Nationality Rooms as well Pitt has a wireless network in the building so a lot of students hide away and study there or just procrastinate by web surfing Secret tip take the elevators to the 35th 36th floor the view is fantastic 
-HEjaAyy6cgDDhXSXJIuAg CMU Good sandwich selections I had the Rachel corned beef with coleslaw along with a side of potato salad The Russian sauce they put on the sandwich is a little on the sweet but I think it worked well The potato salad is also very eggy and a little sweeter than normal but I didn t mind The staff was friendly and my food came in a timely manner 
-hFPrtyQwS-yEkrojuao3Q CMU This little bar and grill makes me want to move to Pittsburgh so bad I ve been here twice Once in 2009 and again in 2011 and the food and booze always makes me happy Both of my visits were for the Pittsburgh Bacon Bash and of course I ate tons of bacon things but I also grabbed a few items from the amazing menu of humorously named entrees and appetizers My favorite app was the bacon chicken wings which were lightly battered and bathed in BaconSalt and then topped with crumbled bacon awesomeness With a big bacon bloody mary it s the perfect meal I also had The Central Park The Old Fashioned Hog Heaven the Bacontini a few cosmos of greatness and a lot of great local beer For such a small place the beer options are great While the prices were a bit high 12 for some of the drinks compared to anything near me the quality and quantity both make it worth the bucks I also played What s Up Pussycat on the jukebox 10 times in a row and made a lot of people laugh hysterically 
-I86blBxd9isOsTNFvj-RA CMU My niece decided to put all her stuff in storage rather than bring it home for the summer when she finished up her first year at Pitt this past week I told her we d help her move stuff since she couldn t rent a U haul or a car to do the moving due to her age She did a little web research and picked Iron City Self Storage due to its proximity to Pitt We loaded up the car and brought the stuff over I almost blew past it coming down the street that Mapquest put us on Webster to Blessing so a more noticeable sign BEFORE the turn in might be nice I got down to Bigelow and managed to safely turn around and come back up to the parking lot My niece checked in and got paid up for the summer About 150 for her to put her stuff safely away in a 4x4x4 container She was incredibly worried that she would not have enough space but it turned out to be just right One of the employees Tom helped us bring the stuff in and he brought the first cart load up into the storage unit for us It was most of the heavy stuff so we were super thankful for that He was incredibly helpful and wonderful and I think that set my niece at ease She had a lot of extra space so she confessed to me that she had more stuff in her room We went back and got her things and the second car load filled the rest of the container wonderfully The facility is really clean and wonderful As I mentioned the only thing I d change is a sign before the parking lot so silly people like me won t miss the parking lot as they re looking for Bigelow We ll be using their services again in the future I m sure 
-iKL997LpsD1lwKjV-iwpg CMU I have used the William Penn Jewelers in Regent Square and I am nothing but happy with the work they have done They created custom engagement wedding rings for me and they turned out better than I ever thought it would The prices are fair for the work they do Unlike the other jewelry store in the area you don t need shoes that cost as much as a car to get some one to help you I once waited for 25 min at jelery store on Forbes before I left without a single person talking to me That is why I use William Penn will only give them my business Disregard what people say about the time it takes Quality takes time Be cautious about reviews if someone goes there to replace the battery in my watch then they say my watch was wound they might not know too much about watches or if someone claims to know how easy a project is when they a probably have never done it them selves Taking pictures seems relatvely easy too but ask a professional photographer how easy it is I also like that they allow me to bring my dogs in 
-IpueLB2t0jHuDByzN6WrQ CMU Most of their food is just okay I ve been there once and got fried mushrooms loaded cheese fries and wings The cheese fries were good the mushrooms were kinda not good But the wings were some of the best I had The bartender had his own sauce recipe not on the menu he said it was mayo hot sauce and I think some italian seasoning dressing Either way they were saucy delicious They are also fried breading covered which is not usual But it made them that much better 
-Ivw9EPwdASuO8Fq5k4MgQ CMU I think this place is pretty tasty And I ve never really noticed problems with service Maybe I m just not looking hard enough for all of these faults that everyone else finds here 
-J81R-4gwrLGp5eMzPldOw CMU On my way home from work I always walk by this place and I always see people walking into here So I decided to give it a shot and see what s up I m not a health freak or a food guru nor am I picky about food but this place is just plain bad The 5 meal is pretty decent until they charge you an extra 2 for lo mein instead of rice But the biggest thing that bothers me is the huge puddle of oil that the food sits in Again I m not a health freak but eatting this food just made me feel guilty With every bite I think about getting a heart attack at 27 There s as much oil as there sauce and you see the thick oil floating above don t expect a fantastic dining area either it s dark and feels icky I ve had my fair share of cheap chinese food and this is probably the worst I ve tried 
-JwFk3RhcJ3qxn4n-XpqWw CMU dear lulu what s happened to you you used to be the refuge for my asian food fix but your food leaves something to be desired lately dr fu s noodles has way too much salt noodle bowls are only ok you re a noodle place after all no excuses for being less than stellar the bibimbop looks like a medley of canned products and tastes like it i really want to like you you do have a great menu selection terrific drinks very cool vibe great location and efficient waitstaff but something in the kitchen really needs to change please please i hate to say but it s not me it s you 
-k4mb6Jbw6PXvpiKYOMGiw CMU I m sorry guys really I understand every place has to have something they can boast and call their own but with all of the hype I was beyond greatly disappointed in the food Soggy as a rain drenched rat and as tasteless as one of the Kardashians I am all for a good corned beef sandwich when I find one but not here Seriously save you time and energy fighting with a crowd and go to Sammy s instead At least you can taste the meat on their sandwiches The single star isn t to be spiteful but for the shattered expectations 
-kWtneSVeIVnVjQILBP5eA CMU This is one of my favorite comic shops and now that they have the new space there s not as much awkward sweaty squeezing as you browse This place has moved around a lot but always remained somewhere on Craig street as long as I ve been going The selection is pretty great and they can order pretty much anything you can t find Tons of back issues and trades Tons of indie press and now more action figures and movies The guys working there are super sweet if a bit shy at first and they just love comics and make excellent suggestions I have to say these shops are usually a labor of love and these guys absolutely love comic books 
-l1IBz5wVa40uhgPDK8JYw CMU I have always bee a fan of the big burrito restaurants My boyfriend and i have been there 4 times and each time it has been amazing the decor is excellent and its dark and even romantic they also have a hip bar with couches and they open it up during the summer During certain holidays they have the chefs tasting menu which has 4 courses My boyfriend got that during their thanksgiving special and he LOVED IT I have gotten the spinach and mushroom dumplings as a starter a couple of times and they were amazing the pepper dipping sauce was soo delicious for my entree i got the red curry tofu and the flavors were amazing it was very filling and all the vegetables blended well for desert i got the caramel bomb and it was DELISH I ve had the vegetarian pad thai on a different occasion and that was pretty amazing too They dont have too many vegetarian options i kind of wish they did They have a great wine and cocktail selection too For non vegetarians the chefs tasting options they have every once in a while are amazing 
-lCoKEY7YOa440w7S7oHoQ CMU I had a day off from work today and since I ve been looking for a good sandwich place since Kazansky s closed I thought I d try Uncle Sam s Believe me folks the subs here are ridiculously large I know that Uncle Sam s is known for their fries but that s why I skipped them I went for the salami and cheese sub which was pretty tasty But I guess subs don t do it for me like a good sammitch does 
-LSU888BtxdRe-Ziy0NuBg CMU Incredible I had the pumpkin soup a favorite of mine this was the second best I ve had 1 belongs to Abay I also had the tofu platter veggies were spot on cooked until soft but still retaining shape color and texture My companion had the vegetable coconut soup which was overflowing with all sorts of veggies and the broth was just heavenly He also ordered mussaman chicken curry which consisted of big chunks of chicken and potatoes that were simmered in the sweet yet spicy mussaman sauce I actually ended up dipping my veggies in his sauce it was so wonderful We both got a spice level 9 which provided just enough heat without making your nose run The staff were friendly and efficient Can t wait to go back 
-mo3b7vqoY1KCCuju6voyQ CMU Szmidt s is fantastic Go there Delicious homemade bread corned beef pastrami etc Artfully made sandwiches choice of classic or new world prirogies burgers deli sides great prices easy parking The owners staff are very friendly and welcoming and the interior of the deli is clean and attractive My fiancee ordered The Szmidt featuring homemade pastrami provolone caramelized onions thinly sliced pickles and mustard I had the Szmidt s version of a Reuben The Sassano homemade corned beef swiss homemade kraut and thousand island dressing It was definitely one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life and I m a sandwich lover The meat was tender flavorful and not fatty The kraut offered a nice sour kick without being overpowering The bread was outstanding nicely yeasty and homemade tasting sliced a little thickly I wasn t very hungry but I couldn t help but eat the entire sandwich They are not huge but generously sized with a perfect proportion of ingredients Interesting fact You can add a fried egg on top for 99 if that s your thing 
-NdNWhl9NPhlfsZ8E3tzyw CMU We just love this tiny hole in the wall sushi place The interior is very homely and has a good atmosphere When you order any of the meals which they have a good selection of and is very authentic there is always a starting salad with japanese ginger dressing which is excellent a piece of fried chicken that is succulent and also a small bowl of miso soup that is just the right flavor The sushi here is always fairly fresh and they carry some of the harder to find fish such as fatty tuna The only negative we find with this restaurant is the small seating capacity and combined with the popularity and lack of the ability to make reservations sometimes it is a long wait If you want good Japanese food in Pittsburgh definitely visit this place 
-Oazo2rb5QyxalhbCmhVUg CMU I have been going to Biketek for almost 6 years over which time I have bought quite a few bikes from my daughter s cruiser to mtb to carbon race and triathlon bikes I continue to return to Biketek despite living on the other side of town where it is more convenient to go to another shop Their friendly enthusiastic and professional staff offer outstanding service I appreciate their honesty and integrity They recommend what is right for you and not necessarily what will bring them the most profit from a sale If you have every been to a bike shop and felt like you were buying a used car you know what I mean I cannot offer a higher recommendation for a bike shop I will go no where else Frank and his staff are the best 
-oiSCg_xXuXUgWd4Ncnehw CMU Dropped in for a snack What we sampled The plain pretzel balls good texture and flavor Jalapeno cheese dip good and spicy but it was a little thin so it had trouble adhering to the outside of the pretzel balls Cinnamon sugar pretzel balls delicious Berry cream cheese dip outstanding Tasted so good on both of the pretzel balls Overall this was a nice quite place to try out a snack but I have not returned since mostly because each time I have passed by it looks closed 
-OzJoWurVQm-tTndBeMYqg CMU Everyone loves Peter s No really I don t get it either Service is good enough during off hours The waitresses are friendly and the bar service is prompt It s a little dingy but what do you expect from an Oakland bar The drink selection itself is laughable Nothing creative and no killer money saving specials here The draft beers are limited to macros with the occasional high end import or domestic I d give Peter s a higher rating if they closed during the peak hours It s just awful then Everyone goes to Peter s in Oakland so expect significant crowds on Friday Saturday nights Don t wear nice clothes unless you want them to be covered in a mix of your sweat other people s sweat and drinks that ll inevitably spill on you Also be prepared to stand at the bar for upwards of 20 minutes to get a drink It s that crowded The bouncers don t really do their job Some dude was passed out in a chair for a half hour I think that s grounds for being booted but who am I to judge Peter s has an equally crowded bar upstairs too with a stage area that doubles as a sizeable dance floor Cover is free unless there s a band playing but you probably don t want to see a shitty band at a shitty bar anyway Oh and the best part is that every night a different fraternity and sorority storm the bar at around 12 doubling the crowding and wait time Seriously don t go here unless you have to There are better cheaper bars in Oakland 
-P50RgNcIVbkcdrSyAfASg CMU Don t go to Qdoba across the street Veracruz has decent Mexican food and good prices Fast service and good quality Probably the best enchiladas verdes in PGH but you can do better at home armed with one of Diana Kennedy or Rick Bayless s cookbooks If you re in a rush though this is your best option on that strip 
-p6D-iXzxQjMRlRSLmIZLg CMU Food is solid especially for a place whose main focus is on being a bar and a see and be seen spot Pleasantly surprised by very good prompt and friendly service Wouldn t go here as a destination for a meal but when you re on Walnut and aren t up for the usual bar fare or one of the more upscale places it s a good compromise with reliably decent to very good food 
-pmQpCkrqfzMzuAS_7HoDw CMU Best fast food burgers you can get ANYWHERE I spent the summer in CA and had In n Out Burger a few times and there s no comparison The toppings and fries make it the best Load up your burger fo free 
-PpqDndVuOvXnD_VlUshfg CMU A fantastic place to grab brunch on a weekend We tried the special Banana Walnut Hotcakes and that was sooo delish We also ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and that Corned Beef was even better than the ones from Le Peep back in NJ SO wish we had a Pamela s back home and the prices in Pitt was VERY cheap comparing to NYC and NJ PS This is a CASH ONLY place and setting is very much like a diner but AWESOME food ENJOY 
-pVKws8fk7RfNZL2ywOZkA CMU Falafel is ok but nothing special It s been served twice in what can only be described as a salad with a little bit of falafel sprinkled in Also it s mushy not crispy on the outside which is not necessarily bad but not my particular favorite However what s up with those fries They are amazing 
-QRIGiPqJ0uqBG3zJfDFzA CMU This place is a disappointment It took 2 hours to get my pizza when they told me 45 minutes to an hour I was told the first time the driver was leaving in 2 minutes and I was his only stop It took another 50 minutes to get to my house I live about 10 minutes away When it finally got to my house after three calls and two hours it was cold When I put it in the microwave it wasn t even good warm pizza The Pizza was okay at best just not worth a 2 hour wait I will avoid this place going forward Pizza Sola is way better 
-rMKUVJBGz2uL5LfiPPBXg CMU Chinese food for white people You can tell they have some skill in cooking and the ingredients tasted fresh but it s extremely Americanized Chinese food The flavors taste seriously wrong to a Chinese palate If you re white and prefer lighter less oily psuedo Chinese fare it s one of the better places I ve tried 3 stars because I m Chinese 
-rrAfOqyy2HguKuMZqD4mQ CMU Do not whatever you do Do not go here to get your eyebrows waxed whatsoever There is only one girl that does eyebrows and she has absolutely no clue what symmetry means I walked out of there with my eyebrows completely UNEVEN and mishapen Timothy I reccommend you employ someone new NOTE My rating is based on Eyebrow Waxing Unfortunately I do not get my nails done EVER So please keep in mind when reading my review for this location that it is solely based on my experience with waxing and waxing ONLY 
-RT__6kWVUfvLdostzDTug CMU This cute and friendly little Irish store sells many fine Irish gifts clothes jewelry wedding rings included and many other good finds 
-rY3QVEehLcvFrEV1wMrCQ CMU Came for Dim Sum They have standard dim sum choices Overall it was mediocre in my opinion I agree with many of the other reviews here Missing Golden Palace 
-smqE8bFjukfxWiiwD_Qng CMU I m not really a dessert person but I was going home to visit and I always like to bring a little bit of Pittsburgh home with me so I stopped in for some goodies I got an assortment of their mini pastries which was perfect because you get to sample a little bit of everything Everyone was impressed In fact so impressed that I m not allowed home without a Prantl s box in my hand The burnt almond torte with vanilla icing is simply to die for I ve had it several times and it s always been moist and an explosion of nutty goodness with every bite Let me stop myself this is starting to sound dirty In addition to wonderful pastries they also offer a decent selection of breads and rolls which are tasty as well but I wouldn t go out of my for them 
-sn53qddNleVESGKreB60w CMU I don t see the big deal about Soba Lounge I thought the food was only okay and I didn t like all of the flavors overpowering each other The ambience is really nice and the servers are friendly but the food was just alright for me 
-T-y8RdCrm2TB4ejYi8h3w CMU Service can be a bit slow at times Also I rarely see the place crowded Still its a good place to eat Usually people go for the daily specials where they give you a big plate with their house salad delicious a daily changing entree rice and some bread It s about 10 dollars They usually have 2 vegetarian and 2 non vegetarian daily options I love their limeade its terrifically bright and fresh made from real limes Also if you happen to be really rich which I m not you might fancy buying some of the Peruvian art they sell in the store Try touching the pelts on your way out probably the softest fur you ve ever felt in your life Also they have fun finger dolls knit to look like naked people The nudists sell for about 3 bucks a pop though 
-taDjdmp94Tz-l9miE4z_Q CMU Finally a good Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh Even the decor and ambiance seems authentic with the family style tables paper tablecloths and slightly sticky seats The food is top notch we ordered from the Chinese menu rather than the American menu and were thrilled with our dishes I had shredded pork in garlic sauce and my husband had some sort of duck with Devil s Tongue yams Oh actually I suppose I did order from the American menu I got a cup of hot and sour soup and loved it Perfect for a cold night The waiter was terrific he gave our 6 month old a fortune cookie wrapped in crinkly plastic which kept her entertained for quite awhile By the time we left around 6 30 on a weeknight there was a decent crowd and all seemed to be enjoying themselves We re looking forward to going again 
-tDgy-Lwcgt07atC4_Qp9g CMU This is the only place in Oakland that takes reservations Ergo this is the only place we as the chemistry department at Pitt tend to take seminar speakers so as not to make them wait for a table during the typical Oakland lunch rush That being said I ve been here ALOT I wouldn t say anything stands out as a must have but their pizza is probably the best thing on the menu I ve never been disappointed in it I ve had their mozzarella tomato salad and their pan seared salmon salad when I ve been on a health kick and they were pretty good Simple and satisfied my desire to eat light The bruschetta and calamari appetizers are my go to choices The only thing I don t like and perhaps this is crazy but that piece of bread that comes with the salads But now I m nit picking It s bread for gosh sake 
-tdqnQP_1kuz8TBEKmwHMw CMU Delicious food and great atmosphere It s a great restaurant for a special occasion but not for your average dinner out 
-tnqO9J1PuBAt_2T2Zu2tA CMU Hemingway s is good at what it intends to do get college students drunk The drink selection is pretty terrible unless you like discount shots with no top shelf liquor and mediocre at best draft choices I never went here much as an undergrad and I only go now before 9pm and only for the exceptional grilled cheeses they have a great variety and all are made with thick Italian bread If you work in Oakland you can t beat a delicious non chain restaurant sandwich for 5 99 7 99 
-U9AemZwlidtDvu14sTEwg CMU Excellent massage Was able to ease tension in my back and neck 
-UNQwf7zUG597U-d6rPhMQ CMU Raspberry Mocha makes me happy Super rich and delicious 
-vvhpC_aKTMJfjylrp4F4Q CMU I end up at Gluuteny every single time I visit Squirrel Hill because I want to love this bakery and now that I ve tried almost all their offerings in the way of prepared goods I can safely say It s okay Their brownies 2 50 are the best thing they make in my book they re better than most normal brownies So good they don t taste gluten free Hell yeah I ll make that claim The pumpkin and lemon loafs 5 are addictive I ate one small loaf in a day by myself and then I ate another one don t judge me The pumpkin tart 2 50 is also really good The muffins 2 come in blueberry orange cranberry and chocolate chip and are on the spongy side but their flavor is spot on The cookies 2 however aren t done right the sugar cookies are slathered in what can only be described as a suspicious amount of frosting The other varieties like chocolate chip and walnut chocolate chip are just too crunchy to be enjoyable What can I say I like soft cookies If you re gluten free this is a good place to stock up on pizza crust and pancake mixes bread muffins or any other pastry mix your heart desires the lady in front of me bought fifty bucks worth of stuff The girls behind the counter that rock some of the cutest haircuts in all of PGH are willing to answer any questions or explain that you need to cook the pizza at a higher temperature to get the crust the right texture Plus you can order birthday cakes 
-W3YFr1jGFt3rQcXV09gwQ CMU OMG am I so ready to go back to San Francisco that I just can t wait any longer for Asian food And now I ve found the 6th thing that is more expensive in Pittsburgh than San Francisco The Thai food here in Shadyside Sure it s decent tasting nothing out of this world Portions are rather small by Pittsburgh standards But curry for 12 95 I mean you can get the same dish for almost half the price in SF I know it s Walnut Street but why are the prices so high Next time I ll hold out a little longer 
-WGsDynTp6HuJnHf1SKvXQ CMU Joe Mama s is just lacking too many things There s a lack of atmosphere lack of great food and lack of great drinks The food is decent but don t expect too much Overall look elsewhere there are better places very very close by The food is Italian but pretty uninspired Olive Garden is better and I really don t like Olive Garden The drinks are pretty standard cocktails but not particularly strong or reasonably priced The atmosphere is annoying I m not sure why I dislike it so much but I do I think it s just weird to have a dinerish theme but be italian food 
-w_clzqI9bQuZ6Zig1DnVg CMU Spice Island is popular among our hospital crew to order from for lunch in Oakland via Wheel Deliver I have never actually been in the restaurant so my review will be based strictly on the food I have had the pad thai and java fried rice from Spice Island and both are just OK and forgettable The biggest complaint I have with each dish I ve had is that the quality of meat and seafood is not very good The shrimp in my pad thai was strange tasting and tough and the meat I ve had in other dishes was fatty Another pet peeve of mine is the amount of grease and oil in the dishes I expect a certain amount of oil but this literally leaves puddles of the stuff at the bottom Finally each dish I ve had is disappointingly flavorless The portions are HUGE but I d rather pay for less food with more flavor I have heard great things from friends about Spice Island so I d like to actually go to the restaurant to eat some time but I think I ll be passing for lunch for now on 
-xlk9RTeOs1Cj4VIA-t28Q CMU A decent and clean Indian store that s close by For the most part they have a good selection of Indian staples Their fresh produce can be iffy You have to go on the right days to get to the fresh veggies which is on Thursday Their products are moderately priced and the staff is friendly and always helpful 
-xND-Ut6cdCtQ1Oro0I8mQ CMU My best friend s all time favorite ice cream parlor is Dave Andy s she loves ice cream I love ice cream I knew there was a reason I liked her so much SO of course when we visited her hometown together she took me to D A s I ve never been a huge fan of cookies n cream ice cream but you put OREOS with COFFEE ICE CREAM OMG my world stopped spinning for the 15 minutes I was eating my ice cream cone Where has this combination been all my life I m picky about my coffee ice creams and the flavor of theirs was perfect they roast their own coffee I ve yet to visit a place that offers coffee oreos BUT because I have my own ice cream maker 
-y8ovjUCkyGAvyQF2VwpHg CMU Walter s was SO helpful when our daughter s car was misdiagnosed by another garage He talked us through the options over the phone we re 300 miles away and helped us find a solution Two thumbs up 
-YcvdC9vdVLPwd0eH1MvuQ CMU I had the opportunity to eat at Toast again this year and I can say that it was even better than before The menu was great and the Black Drum which I had never heard of before was excellent I highly recommend eating at Toast if you are in Pittsburgh and looking for somewhere to exceed your expectations 
-YNFThuMpCz4nhl3lbsB-w CMU This is one of my favorite hidden lunch spots in the city despite it not actually being very hidden I see other people have dealt with a female shop keeper but every time I go it s Frank And Frank is gruff and on point Don t expect masturbatory groveling complete with smiles instead look forward to a great meal made by someone who takes the time to craft each dish with care from scratch The shwarma is amazing though get the chicken and not the meat and the falafel is the most authentic you ll be able to get your hands on in this city Finally I normally hate baklava as it s normal dry and and made of prepackaged philo but the baklava served here is almost reason enough to drive all the way out to squirrel hill 
-Z9sb0HiYVtMQQd0E0DRBg CMU i think i m in love i had heard about pamela s before and that it s the best place for brunch but i hadn t had a chance to go until yesterday i get inside and was not exactly blown away small diner style cash only restaurant but ok at least it will probably be cheap right the menu looks pretty promising interesting choices breakfast and lunch not a huge menu but not bad i decide to go with the feta and spinach omelet with the potatoes and my friend that went with me went with the crepe hotcakes the food comes and i begin to dig in bam the magic occurs the omelet was tasty and the potatoes were even tastier i had a bite of my friend s hotcakes and was blown away moral of the story don t judge a book by it s cover the food entirely speaks for itself and makes this place a 5 star worthy breakfast joint 
-_K9KqNH0hJqu-bCxgkhdg CMU Bangkok Balcony was really my first foray into Thai food and it set the bar high The environment is relatively elegant particularly for the Squirrel Hill area and the food is delicious I particularly remember having great service some the waiters even started to recognize me and I didn t go that often I also remember the neat weighted silverware but that doesn t exactly figure into the review Anyway I was a big fan of this place for all 4 years of my college experience Definitely recommend if you re looking for a non hole in the wall Asian food experience 
-_lJP5u4rhDDt130ci_6dw CMU I wish I could write separate reviews for their gelato and for the rest of their food The gelato would easily get 5 stars It s not as rich as real Italian gelato but the flavors are excellent As for the food well it s just okay After the Yelp Elite event there which was awesome my wife and I went back for lunch and had the bufala mozzarella pizza and the portobello salad The pizza tasted okay but the consistency was all off The dough was soggy too much sauce and limp and nothing actually stayed on the pizza it all just fell right off The salad was also okay the lemon zest was a nice touch but it was pretty uninspired Just a bunch of arugula and maybe 1 2 a mushroom cap that s it If I were in a pinch I would probably go back but it won t be my top choice That said get the gelato 
-_PYOWJQn4N1-qUkYi6faw CMU When you first come to Pittsburgh everyone will urge you to go to Primanti s or Primanny s in Yinzer I think it was ok but not great at this particular location The restaurant is kind of cramped and dirty and it seems like there is a layer of grease on everything The service is pretty poor at the counter although in one visit and older man waited at our table and he was quite good The portions are generous the sandwich bread is good and the fries are very good Unfortunately there are two issues 1 the coleslaw is not so great More like lettuce with vinegar 2 the meat quality is not great Most of the sandwiches I ve had are questionable in their meat either too greasy or odd textured I go back every few months hoping to be wowed and it just hasn t happened maybe the hype outshines the reality 
-_rPf-j0Fy2kP2LMCRWyBA CMU Really nothing special to this place except the outside seating they have in the summer Recently came here and my friend ordered a Coors Light draught wimp i know but it tasted absolutely awful Don t know if it was the keg that was bad or the hoses that hook up to the keg that need to be cleaned Next I got a Turkey Rachel Probably one of the most flavorless sandwiches I ve ever had The only thing I could really taste was the rye bread it was on which was quite good My friend got the veggie powerhouse salad He did seem to enjoy that I had a bite as well and I will say not bad Overall service was super slow I don t think I ll be back for a meal anytime soon It s just too mediocre to waste your time money or calories here 
0-myz8x5g-2bOToeVs88bg CMU I think the prices could be lower for what is offered you pay more for the same loaf of gluten free bread at Gluuteny than at Giant Eagle right next to it The cookies were amazing though I was not expecting their products to also be primarily vegan Their pizza rolls bread with tomato sauce and cheese was not worth it I like my cheese and animal products just not the gluten At least I know where to go for amazing gluten free cookies 
0-wEqR7HaV7j7Bff0k2AFA CMU First off I loved the atmosphere and layout of this restaurant so much that I knew I would be coming back again and again I ordered pretty boring things so I don t feel it s fair for me to rate the food entirely I did try my friend s dishes and really enjoyed the duck as well as the roast beef sandwich I was also a big fan of their crispy taters I ll definitely be back again 
00hn-wCgvHY_lm1S5QCzVw CMU I went to Henne Jewelers to get the size of a watch adjusted A friendly woman greeted me as I walked in and after telling her what I was looking for she made sure I was okay with the price of 25 which I thought was fantastic that she was upfront She put my watch on my wrist and asked how I wanted it to fit then got it adjusted within a matter of a few minutes It was really easy and I ll be back if I need anything like that again 
027XE8NLsC_NyqAIHMhGfQ CMU I ve eaten at Lulu s Noodles two times now and have mixed feelings about the food The restaurant itself has a very casual and atmosphere during lunch you order at the counter as most of its patrons are Pitt Carnegie Mellon students The restaurant is clean and spacious and the service is wonderful As it is a pan Asian restaurant don t expect its food to very authentic to any particular region I was very surprised as what was passed off as pho the first time I ate there It was certainly not anything like what you would get at an actual Vietnamese restaurant the broth was bland and I think they used the wrong kind of noodles and it didn t come with lime lemon I should have known better I did however LOVE their pad thai which was also not very authentic no tamarind paste etc It was good though because I was craving a carb fest So all in all I d give it three stars they have their own interpretations of classic Asian dishes and whether their interpretations of them are good or not is a crap shoot 
02QiypM5jRZazoqGCqYMmg CMU Went to Capristo for the first time yesterday and had a very positive experience I ve been looking for a new gal or guy to cut and color my hair ever since I broke up with my previous hair cutter and colorer Actually I didn t officially break up I just ditched her Callus you say Perhaps but I don t always know what to do in this instance Things go well for awhile and then you get to a point where you feel the lovely person cutting your hair just isn t bringing it isn t always doing exactly what you want maybe even makes mistakes When that happens to me I ll speak up and give it another try but one bad haircut can make me a little nuts and I start looking around Perhaps you think me disloyal but it s my hair and I am not without a certain amount of vanity Plus this whole cut and color thing is costing a small fortune so I feel justified in taking my biz elsewhere I called up and asked for Sara as someone else had posted a positive review about her Good choice Sara is competent skilled and talented She s also a very good listener I told her my tale of woe and she came up with some suggestions and solutions that really worked She s also got some crazy cool techniques with the scissors and I left with exactly the head of hair that I had envisioned as perfection in my imagination Why not then 5 stars you ask I ll revisit this review in the next 6 months and may up it to 5 stars but time will tell Hopefully the wonderfulness will continue and this will turn into a long term relationship Yes I m high maintenance when it comes to my hair thanks for noticing Overall I also like the salon itself The women at the desk were helpful and friendly although very busy and multi tasking plus dealing with a computer that was going all wonky I was offered coffee and water more than once The coffee is good This is a busy salon and they seemed to be holding it together with some grace If you park on the street you ll have to feed the meter after 2 hours which Sara kindly did for me as I had foil sticking up all over my head at the time There is an adjacent lot which will cost you about 7 for 3 hours 
030otpgEln8EftKbFTjYZg CMU We went to Legume on Saturday for dinner The restaurant is small but friendly atmosphere We had the pre fix four course dinner The menu changes periodically but the flavor remains consistent and wonderful For appetizers we had turnip soup and sate mushrooms Entrees we picked duck and salmon Lastly panna cotta for desert Everything was delicious The service was excellent We definitely return to try out new menus and recommend this place anytime 
036Y51JBWpYS-gwO3EJUxQ CMU FUKU My friend and I were headed to our old trusty Sushi Boat in Oakland and realized that Sushi Fuku had opened We decided to go there instead and let s just say it s added to our list of places to eat lunch at once a week It s clean it s new the stuff is fresh you can create your own sushi you can create your own rice bowls My friend likened it to creating a burrito bowl at Chipotle What I m most impressed with are the machines that lay the rice on the seaweed wrapper and the one that cuts the sushi into 10 perfect pieces It loses a little authenticity because it s not done by hand BUT it s still awesome to watch Definitely worth a try if you re in search of sushi in Oakland I think it will win over the other 2 sushi places that are within steps of each other on Oakland Ave Sushi Boat and Oishi Bento 
03_nKqlRhIrTWW7AoRX4zw CMU I eat at Harris all the time I don t even MEAN to I just happen to end up here a lot I think it s because it s the kind of place that lots of people can agree on pretty good food and drinks and a KILLER patio For me the patio kicks it up from 4 to 5 stars in the winter they don t serve lunch In the summer this place is hoppin all the time and yes I m that jerk hogging a giant table waiting for my friends to show up they re just PARKING speaking of parking don t park in the lot next door you WILL get towed None of the other reviews mentioned yet that they recently changed the menu one of the great new additions is the BBQ pork sandwich I love it in slider form get the coleslaw with it and stick it on the sando delish I don t even LIKE coleslaw including on a primanti s bros sando so you know it s good The mac and cheese add the andouille sausage is a staple and you can get a mini version as a side to an entree for just a little extra Another new addition is the chicken fried bacon yes you read that correctly It is a hearty plate of bacon that is battered and fried and comes with white gravy I ve shared it 3 times with friends and each time it s been a little different but also kind of left me a little queasy although with a happy novelty food feeling I would definitely not recommend one person trying to eat this unless they were trying to commit suicide by bacon which I also don t recommend and I LOVE bacon Overall I love this place and I don t think the drinks are more expensive than most of the other places on Ellsworth half price frozen cosmos are definitely worth it Service is also usually great 
04GYPYEv7f8dwsY0uNF7rg CMU Reasonable priced draft beers They have Arrogant Bastard Ale on tap which makes my husband very happy Good service Bathrooms are fairly clean for a bar 
05-zqoeAUf-uQ6N5Nynfjw CMU Wow Best sandwich I ve had in ages I had to grab a quick bite asked the guy how long it would take and he said ten but I must have had my sandwich in five minutes tops I took a bite and it rivaled anything I have eaten in NYC or elsewhere Fresh bread great corned beef even the kraut was incredible and I normally don t like sauerkraut Cant wait to try some of the other menu items I hear they might start delivery soon Please include Oakland Shadyside or hook up with Wheel Deliver 
05auyEYDj36oZ06fU_haCQ CMU It s a great place to go to eat late at night if you are hungry Open 24 hours 
05vkUnLZ1ZC4IVoVF9ys6Q CMU Houghs flies under the radar in the Pittsburgh beer scene Thankfully so as I really didnt want to wade through crowds of pretentious yuppies in the Sharp Edge They have a fantastic draft and bottle selection A great redeeming quality is the ability to get sampler flights which is awesome for trying new beers They have a plethora of televisions for sports viewing as well as large and small tables for either a personal setting or communal setting I cannot comment on the food but given what I have witness thus far I will return Stay thirsty my friends 
05VmdOADSoRmG3567ewNQg CMU I found the food to be good but a bit overpriced I liked that they were BYOB The atmosphere was fine but nothing amazing 
05_c3I8O10lspJKNhJ1nIA CMU great baked grinder on great bread at a great price like the sizes not like some places you get way too big and pay for it have nice selection including cookies and sides even nicer that they delivered 
06AelOOA0u-wY4dfiCPURA CMU I will forever remember this drive through conversation Welcome to Wendy s Can I take your order Yeah I d like a Frescuit We ain t got no hashbrowns um all I want it a Frescuit A ight I m just lettin you know 
07yWI_uOQKnL-LvMOdPHFA CMU I went to Soba with some co workers on a work trip to Pittsburgh The wine selection was pretty impressive there was something for every taste and the food was good Not the best pad thai I ve ever eaten pretty dry like it had been sitting a while but my co workers enjoyed their meals Would go back again if I were in the area 
08vAbLvtjQW2QrKuOWnGUw CMU If you are looking for an outstanding comedy gift this is the place for you Also a strategically hip book selection high quality puppets a wall of giggle worthy novelty shirts and a jewelry case Oh and KARDS Found along the wall bacon band aids insta Irish accent mouth spray famous philosopher finger puppets librarian action figure vulgar piggie banks zombie plastic animals etc A tiny sampling of the silliness 
08VGf8cw9kpuoYGghnhgIg CMU I had a wonderful stay this past week Very friendly and helpful staff VERY comfortable and very easy walk to CMU and eating places in Shadyside I will make this my base in Pittsburgh 
0acKpg8G7jOutRDtPUlLKw CMU I used to live around the corner from this place and worked across the street at the hospital Ritters is a great 24 7 greasy spoon diner with adorable vintage juke boxes at the booths waitresses who have been there forever and patrons who have been lifers as well Its certainly not a place to go for health food or fine cuisine but its great breakfast food and even greater place to be for late night after the bar drinking 
0aCMMCvEBo2t9FYtwHD8rQ CMU I had to give this place 4 stars b c i have so many fond drunken memories of it My overweight RA took me to this place the day i moved into my dorm and i knew from that day forward that this place would be a favorite pitt stop on my drunken walk home The french fries are greasy and amazing and you get to choose a dipping sauce my favorite is cheese but you can get gravy or ranch too I bet plenty of freshman can blame the O for their infamous 15lb weight gain another perk is being able to stop by and get white trash 40oz mickeys to share with my roomates on hot summer nights I ll always love this place go PITT 
0ARhFrkRqFcyCjZaJMoT-A CMU This is my go to Indian store when I m in need of something quick for my weekday meal They have a decent variety of Indian staples Their produce is mostly OK and I tend not to buy anything fresh there I notice that it goes bad quickly Although their cilantro and spinach seem to be a safe bet You can find most things here but I still prefer to shop at Patel brothers They do have an Indian buffet priced per lb The food is from Indian Garden on Atwood Street This def doesn t look appetizing to me mostly because it s Indian Garden s food but I ve seen many people swing by just to pick up to go food 
0awQicUktjE9OTtI5GTkPQ CMU Best chicken cheesesteak in the world Period And like everyone says the fries obviously have liberal amounts of crack The waffle fries were even better but I went back recently to find that they are not seasoned and not quite as good Minus one star for that 
0b4ZD1OXUJ1AR7Daho6NTA CMU I just went to UP and couldn t wait to write this review Based on the previous reviews I thought this restaurant would be great however it was NOT This is by far the worst meal I have had in a very long time Let s start with the drinks I had a cinnamon sangria which was watered down and tasted awful I didn t even drink it I had the waitress return it for something else and she still put it on my bill Have they ever heard of customer service where I m from when I return a drink I don t expect it on my bill I then tried the Peach Bellini I am not sure who the bartender is but the last time I checked Prosecco should be served chilled I received an extremely warm drink We also ordered a white wine which was shockingly also served warm This place should really invest in a wine cooler or an ice bucket either one would solve this problem Now to the food We ordered off the small plates the sea scallops and the grilled wild texas shrimp I can sum up the taste of both of these meals simply SALT overload All I could taste on both of these meals was seasoning and not good seasoning It was absolutely disgusting For our main course we ordered the jambalaya The rice although spicy was drowning in a pool of water which washed off any flavor in it Like the sea scallops and shrimp from my previous meal this was also extremely salty I wish I could give this place zero stars but unfortunately I m forced to give it one As on overpriced restaurant the food was horrendous and the drinks were even worse P S I have lived in Manhattan my entire life and recently moved to Pittsburgh this restaurant is nothing near what meal in New York would consist of I am not sure where all these great reviews came from 
0BcpEKbrppCELBJ4lc7b-g CMU SO delicious I need to write a review on another location This one has the benefit of 1 being really close to CMU campus and 2 being right under the labs I spend all my time now Favorites honeydew mango green tea Runner ups original taro most tart flavors The only thing to beware of is the gaping hole in your wallet after you ve punched out an entire card in 2 short weeks 
0bpfJ6_wpk8FsT5jQ24Mzw CMU Indian food is my favorite kind of food and considering I m French it s kinda funny and this is one of the better restaurants in Pittsburgh Their prices are very reasonable and they have many different discount offers going on every week I highly recommend 
0BQM7Q-uC8wSL9JC_ZkRzA CMU Cheap Get the teriyaki chicken on the lunch menu but get it spicy It s decent Like the new sushi bar Decent chinese if you re around CMU and need a cheap lunch 
0bRBAT2PZZAR4LIO5diBMg CMU It was probably a nice restaurant twenty some years ago the locale is a converted pretty Victorian with stain glass windows the bar area displays a disused grand piano propping up bottles of wine the dining room still sports a pastel palette of sea foam and salmon and framed 80 s posters of the same color scheme grace the walls The menu is marginally more updated than the decor Some dishes remind me of food fads from the 90 s e g the chef seems to have a penchant for meat and fruit pairing Overall the menu is too long and rambling without a theme covering everything from the Baja to the Mediterranean The food was unremarkable The bread tasted like a generic supermarket baguette it was served with olive oil and powdery parm i e from the green can For appetizers we ordered the prosciutto and figs as well as the trout and peaches They were probably the highlight of the meal but the portions were tiny and the ingredients were not the best For the main course I tried their fish taco which was on the bland and dry side Summary if you are ever nostalgic for fine dining in a small American town during the 80 s this place is for you 
0bs4yinYRyEp55PjUgxXYQ CMU The food is amazing which is what causes the common wait however its definately worth the wait The vegetarian crepe is one of the most amazing meals you could ask for the tomatoes are slightly spicy and the soytang dressing compliments the crepe well This is one restaurant I doubt I would ever tire of I would often go with friends order a savory crepe and split a sweet one with a friend My mouth is watering just thinking of the yummy food 
0bsTBG5BaYtyVzkxB0RzuA CMU American Chinese food is greasy and terrible everywhere and that s what we know and love about it However Chopstix has accomplished the amazing feat of actually making greasy fried food taste bland One day I came home craving Chinese and serendipitously found one of their menus stuffed in my mailbox along with some absurdly good coupons I placed a huge order and paid almost nothing for it I guess I got what I paid for because the food was barely edible The Cold Sesame Noodles were just plain noodles no sauce and I don t think the Fried Rice was actually fried but it was inexplicably neon yellow in color I couldn t even find the chicken in my General Tso s it was mostly breading and a sweet and sour sauce I learned my lesson Trust me don t get sucked in by their prices just say NO to Chopstix 
0Bul0rk4y77yoCBxEZNCzg CMU i m generally not one to review chains so when i do it s usually for customer service or lack thereof such is the case with this gap i don t even shop at gap but the bestie and i were doing our usual shadyside rounds last weekend and he really wanted to check out the spring collection so we dipped in bestie found awesome pants suitable for both work and play but they didn t have the color in his size the friendly and super attractive nate immediately asked if he could call another store for us bestie and i agreed the pants would be a wise investment so nate began calling stores nearby and after several minutes found them and placed them on hold though i didn t look at the women s collection like i said i m not a gap goer i did roam around the men s collection while bestie was in the fitting room and was amazed at how mostly everything was in place and cleaned up loads of natural light also make everything even more aesthetically appealing the only thing that would ve been better was a sale oh wait bought three pairs of boxers for a lucky gent for only 15 95 no clothing tax in pgh happy manda panda 
0bvV19hWMRa_m2q4IZ6pgw CMU I went here last summer for my brother s wedding and was reminded that I needed to check the whole place out since I haven t been here since grade school I have a black thumb myself but I really like seeing plants in an environment when they thrive like they do here My favorite room had to be the butterfly room it was like something out of a dream I also really enjoyed the newest addition that had plants from India and the Japanese garden The only negative for me was the parking meters out front that give you a whopping 7 minutes for a quarter Phipps has no control over that I know but it affects the experience It always amazes me that the city cries about people not coming into town to shop and spend money when they are constantly being subjected to ridiculous fees and parking tickets It was nice to see a petition at the front desk at Phipps trying to get the minutes on the meters raised Good place to take a date or to sit and clear your head 
0cF0wtWaD8HdquXWwwrtow CMU Being in this spa comforts my entire body and well being I feel at peace here and often go when my business starts to stress me out The best facial I ve ever had and the decor is awesome It really transform you into another world so that you being to relax as soon as you open the door 
0CftXE8IpOBk641quFxVmQ CMU went to a nice retirement dinner here The rooftop view was nice albeit a bit too sunny at the time the service and food was also great 
0ckme5ZCkmidTGUUdFdNyw CMU Good if not great place to get a meal at Mom and I were having a girls day out and we decided to stop in here for brunch before heading over to the Phipps The chicken n waffles organic fried chicken in gravy plus waffles caught my eye as did the eggs benedict But I was in the mood for some sweetness The cinnamon swirl French Toast with sausage links was pretty good Mmmm French Toast Pump that insulin Susan Pump Whoo hoo The cinnamon did give it a nice bite too Good thing Rick and I hit the bike trails the day beore Mom went for the roasted tomato and bacon frittata which looked good too Many of the negative comments here seem to be about the prices The dinner prices look high for what you get but the brunch prices run about 8 00 10 00 per entree Service here is good though 
0cW18BIMR23_F-oDOpJ4-A CMU I love Big Jim s It s honestly my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh The portions are huge the food is delicious and the price is good I ve had the lasagna several times and it has never disappointed Seriously the portion is huge The servers are always friendly and attentive I ve never had a bad experience at this restaurant 
0dJpD_47XNkUTPvTHASfJg CMU Very yummy I got to try a huge variety of dishes with a big group of friends who knew what they were ordering All dishes were great My favorites were Beef in Hot Broth Shredded Pork w Seasoned Tofu Braised Pork Shoulder Mao s Pork and Double Cooked Pork Belly Off the appetizers one of the Bean Jelly Noodles was delicious and Honey Pork Ribs were also great I know I just listed a ton of dishes because they were all awesome I m actually not great at handling spicy foods but everything was very flavorful with the right amount of spice for me and I didn t have too many problems afterwards Of course you might want to steer clear if you have acid reflux but they do have some good non spicy dishes available like the Braised Pork Shoulder Honey Pork Ribs Finally the prices may seem a little steep but they offer many dishes in two sizes The larger one is HUGE and the smaller portion is fairly regular sized The appetizers are pretty big as well They also put out a complimentary little plate of either fried wonton skins or Chinese style boiled peanuts for you to snack on before your meal Definitely recommend ordering family style and sharing dishes 
0Em-jbO2KKpYqkTveHrq0g CMU First off I love Thai food The mix of flavors found in Thai food are amazing and I m always looking for a new Thai place Silk Elephant always satisfies my taste for Thai Their food has a perfect mix of spiciness and tastiness and their Pad Thai is mad satisfying It has a great location right on Murray and their prices are reasonable Park at Giant Eagle and just walk down 
0Eq7c3oF1AA7c6AyX1oajw CMU My boyfriend and I finally ventured in during an afternoon We had been wanting to go here however our work hours never seemed to coordinate with their restaurant hours Upon entering which is in the sub ground store right next store to Girasole it s very quaint comfortable and homey It s as if you just walked into one of your beachy artsy friend s very over sized dining room where they happen to want to serve everyone in the neighborhood It s a great mixture of at home coziness mixed with your favorite Beach House You can either order things To Go at the counter or sit down and be served We chose to sit down and get the service treatment Our server was very friendly and explained the entrees and smoothies Exactly what Iliana C says in her review the menu has a nice mixture of meat friendly and veggie friendly options We started off with Smoothies I had the Purple Rain apple juice mango banana blueberry pineapple and Jordan had The Energizer apple juice blueberry raspberry kale spirulina Both of the smoothies were extremely delicious and you could tell they were made with fresh ingredients over sugars and syrups Both of the smoothies were bursting with flavor but by the speed in which we drank them The Energizer won that taste test I then had the Turkey Avocado panini with a side of black bean and corn salsa with tortilla chips OMG I loved this sandwich I love simplicity and this sandwich is just that Simple Flavorful Satisfying Plus the black bean and corn salsa again was the most refreshing salsa I ve ever tried besides my own I have tried Planet Smoothie down the street The difference The quality of the ingredients Planet Smoothie is good JBC is GREAT The worst part about this place is that it is currently closed for renovating However I can be patient because our server informed us upon re opening that JBC will be extending their hours into the evening for Dinner and will offer more raw and vegan options than before Can t wait to go back and try all the new things 
0eRmJo7H8E6W_-e1P-H_qQ CMU Great selection of teas A very clean and comfortable space with nice plants Highly recommended as a place to meet a friend or to study The staff is very friendly and helpful The food is very good although I mostly buy the tea 
0ExKlT8WcbEfM2DtaQUv_w CMU Had dinner at Soba on a Thursday night with a friend Went around 6pm no reservations and were seated right away I was talking to my friend about my lack of knowledge of white wine when our waiter came over to fill up our waters He asked if I wanted to learn about white wines and offered us a tasting of 3 varieties He had us try them without telling us what they were The thoughtfulness and interest in pairing our wines with our dinner really made our night We started off with the crispy tofu which I always get and this time did not disappoint I had the mushroom and rice cake noodles and my friend had the seared tuna Both dishes were great aside from the kim chi on my friend s plate that was not very good My dish was on the spicy side so make sure to ask about spice level if that concerns you 
0F42T07SdUQY24pidn9QwQ CMU Uh oh says my wallet This is the LARGEST lululemon I ve ever been to It s an OASIS of yoga clothes The location of this store is perfect the window displays are awesome and the employees are more than helpful without being too too pushy I m sure the classes they offer are fantastic because of the space I would definitely check out their Facebook page http www facebook com lululemonShadyside to keep an eye on their yoga gatherings and run clubs No need to ever buy online if you live in Pittsburgh This store has everything 
0fcNkPb1VGjfso34hJnIVA CMU I ve been waiting for a place like Yinzbugh BBQ for 34 years since I moved to the Burgh This is authentic BBQ with both Southern and Texas influences You find the Southern influence in the delicious BBQ pork delicate smoky and juicy but not at all greasy You can also get the real deal in terms of the BBQ sauces that are available South Carolina style mustard based sauce and North Carolina style vinegar based sauce The Texas influence is in the smoked brisket which literally melts in your mouth You can get this with the ketchup based sauce more popular in Texas Kansas City and Memphis The sides that I have had are the cole slaw and the black eyed peas both of which are outstanding The smoked tofu should delight vegetarians Others have complained about the store bought buns I think if you re looking for a fancy bun you re missing the point This place is all about the meat and the sauce The bun is just something to hold these mouthwatering ingredients together as well as some cole slaw which I recommend piling on your sandwich as well I also have to add that the service is great and the owner knows his stuff and is as nice as can be Check this place out You will not regret it 
0fj8HzJDOej5AcnNhN9AGA CMU I don t think it gets any better than this place In town celebrating a couple of birthdays we started our night at Toast and quickly found out why everyone we talked to described the place as fabulous While I can t say we had the most enthusiastic bar service while we waited for our table the bartender didn t seem to like that we asked him to take our picture so perhaps it was our fault since he was so busy things quickly took a turn for the best when we settled into our cozy booth and were given a tour of the menu by our knowledgeable and attentive server Between the 3 of us we sampled the Ahi Tuna uh maze ing the filet the arctic char and the flounder The wine list was well rounded uninhibited sophisticated and provided very reasonably priced and tasty selections After our meal our server offered to call us a cab so we could continue our celebrating but soon brought the sad news that it would take hours for one to get to us thanks to a Mr Bon Jovi and his concert His alternative suggestion The owner of the bar would drop us off on Ellsworth since he was going to go past it anyway Really When does that type of thing happen I wish I could give this place 10 stars but I ll have to settle with 5 Keep this place in mind when an occasion pops up and a great restaurant is needed You ll want to be here for it 
0FkIKjtHqpWF5GQpSdEEIg CMU Beer selection is incredible considering Oakland is dominated with macrobrew American adjunct lager bars Burgers are excellent Also recommend the Roll a fatty The ceilings are tall and voices echo like you re in a cave It can get very loud in this place 
0FoUAvcZ3I0KBz3z0Gk9uw CMU tl dr Wonderful food bad service I was quite impressed when we first entered Brasserie 33 as the restaurant itself has quite a nice interior It feels very modern and has a sleek look and feel to it My fiance and I were seated immediately and handed menus to look over The waiter we had was a gentlemen then entire time we were there but his skill seemed rather lacking This is perhaps due to the fact that we went on a Saturday afternoon this may not have been the A team of servers He took our drink orders and then a few minutes later took our food orders After taking our orders he simply walked away from our table leaving our menus which were simply printed sheets of paper not particularly nice looking there in front of me They sat there for a fairly long time and every time he walked by to serve the other tables I tried to move them more towards the edge of the table so he would notice them but he never did Finally right before our food was served a completely different waiter took them away Our meals were delicious I ordered the Croque Monsieur and my fiance had the Quiche Lorraine Both came with a side of fries and a side salad The food was delicious with the quiche in particular being stunning The eggs in the quiche were perfectly fluffy and light As a desert we ordered the chocolate mousse and again delicious Now during any other decent meal this would be the time when the waiter would ask if we were ready for our check He did not Over and over again he would walk by to other tables but not once did he say anything about bringing us our check Finally my fiance caught his eye and let him know that we had a Groupon we wished to use Apparently he considered it a great offense that we hadn t told him of this before the meal was started After this we had to wait at least 10 more minutes before we had to catch his attention AGAIN and ASK to be able to pay I have never had to ask to give someone my money before All in all the food was delicious and I would recommend the food but they very much need to improve their service 
0fV7Ct8aBGxC1MaZevWs_w CMU Great food good service good prices This is a nice small restaurant that s not too fancy but has really great food According to the website there is also one in Lawrenceville We tried the Green Curry Pad Thai and Crab Rolls We found the Pad Thai to be a bit too sweet but otherwise very good They have all of the standard Thai dishes and also some Phillipino food There was also a menu of monthly specials with some great looking dishes BYOB 
0Gmgv-gsz3tbn2qArkSz1Q CMU Fuel and Fuddle has my favorite wings of all time I love the hottest ones I eat lots of spicy food and these are the only that are both tasty and spicy Great beer selection I love the alligator stew and waffle fries especially Only problems with F F is how crowded it gets how loud it gets and that it s in Pittsburgh 
0gU-yrDnoAzLNiyWy_ghpA CMU I loved my short haircut I walked in without an idea of what I want and just browsed through the haircut books Min had while she finished up with another client I picked out a couple of pictures that I liked and pointed them out to Min to one of which she said No good no good This place was low key and no frill She didn t shampoo me Instead she just sprayed on water and started cutting I have pretty thick hair and I just sat amazed as she razored and cut away She was efficient finished in 30 minutes right as my parking meter ran out and didn t talk much not to me anyways But the final result was really much better than haircuts that I ve gotten at say Aveda At the end she said Beautiful I requested her to cut off some pieces of hair at the sides and she got a dismayed expression on her face but did it anyways It s broken She said Haha I still liked the haircut No frill also meant the price was pretty reasonable 27 for long hair Not your typical salon but if you have Asian hair and maybe other types of hair it s a good place to go Also she takes appointments but squeezes in whoever walks in as I did So beware even if you have an appointment she might get to you like 15 minutes later than the appointed time But like I said she s efficient 
0gVEHGxdrYziHm4NYM6Z_A CMU Okay le ts get something straight I am not cool For a used clothing store that claims to take used clothing they stink While bringing some clothes to sell recently I was met by a hipster who pleasantly gave me a form to fill out which stated in not so many words that they only take hip clothes and the picking was at the discretion of the clerk Out of 10 items he picked one Paid pretty well about 12 but felt like a tool as I walked out with my below par clothing some items originally cost me 50 under my arm The clothes Smelly as if shoved in a washing machine with a ton of cleanser Hipster stuff to the roof if your a female Men s selection is very small and unless you want pants that cut off the circulation in your you know you will find it hard to spend that well earned credit Also jeans cost between 12 fine and 50 not fine The staff Cooler than me Last time I was in they stupidly giggled behind my back while alternating CD s over the speakers over and over I also think they have a face piercing minimum you see you need to be cool to work there They are presumptuous and could give a crap if you buy or not With REAL used clothing stores like Goodwill that sell the EXACT SAME CLOTHES for a tenth of the price shopping at Avalon will do nothing for you except make you feel bad about what you wear and what you should be wearing 
0i0OHR7BoVIBgMOB6GOXyQ CMU Great florist nice staff My arrangements arrived in perfect condition exactly as Jason and I discussed They even dropped off all the candles Couldn t be happier and my party looked fab 
0ib6m_-Am7cmvF5sUkEnQQ CMU On a rainy Saturday afternoon what s better than seeing a movie I had seen this place and cataloged it away as being worth checking out With this wacky summer rain I decided today would be the perfect day to do so Art house theaters can be really great or a little bit rough in my experience This place was beautiful It seems like it was newly renovated The facilities were clean the chairs were super comfortable and the staff was warm and personable Also they sell adult beverages that are reasonably priced They even have daily specials today s was a Pabst for 2 50 I almost don t want the rain to stop so I can have another excuse to check out that new Woody Allen at the Manor 
0IHnFKDZV17ApM1FuGYEpg CMU A nice option for a bite to eat at the park the cafe serves a nice range of salads sandwiches soups and pizzas and has a welcome number of vegetarian options The prices are quite reasonable for a museum tourist site cafe and the eating area is clean and welcoming They also use biodegradable cups and forks and compost their waste which is nice to see They also focus on organic local food Though my salad wasn t anything super special it was tasty enough and I d happily go back to support Phipps and its cafe 
0IMKRK7vXIdfpaUOz2BPnQ CMU I haven t been here since 1993 I live in So Cal where the lifestyle is healthier than Pittsburgh For 4 years I clogged my arteries and put myself on Lipitor because of this joint Where else can you go and spend 4 on a 1 to 2 ft high pile of french fries They are fresh cut and don t come frozen out of a paper bag They taste DAMN GOOD and better yet they serve Kraft Cheese Whiz Not the imitation the one and only KRAFT If I had a penny for every time I was there drunk or sober I d give Trump a run for his money You go to the O with friends Never by yourself Now granted it s been 15 years and with the price of inflation I can remember spending 1 50 on a great hot dog This hot dog had some snap to it Also a large pizza cost 5 You can go here for less than 5 a person and feed the cast of Entourage including all of Vincent Chase s women I miss this place like there is no tomorrow My arteries will always be aching for The O 
0jEWGHLk8KHtUElet256lA CMU Bangkok Balcony has the BEST Yellow Curry I ve ever had in my life The END 
0JNZOBCwZSpk1lrVQRUMaA CMU How to put this gently While I may go back to Pittsburgh some day I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art It s not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st in sf It comes down to the fact that a docent while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it told the students it was a watchtower from Auschwitz a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews Seriously That s how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint oh that place they basically just fry eggs On top of all that the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler s rule i e not those in Auschwitz In sum docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer and this one sucked So Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh if you re going to hire racist people to lead your tours at least make sure they have their facts straight or can read 
0jSdtfVhoHpw_68ofmvDOA CMU I just may officially be Done with Dunkin Well this location at least I will preface this by saying that sometimes it is the little things in life that keep us going like finding a fiver in an old pair of jeans or pulling up to a parking meeter that already has 30 mins on it This same holds true with store chain punch cards On this day I has enough punches on my DD sandwich card for a free breakfast sandwich and boy was I excited As I handed my card to the cashier who seemed a bit flustered already he stared at it a if I had just tried to use foreign currency After consulting with the manager he returned and with a haughty tone informed me the this DD location does not honor the cards because we are a Kosher restuarant and our prices are higher Really Did you really just say that Pal this is Dunkin Doughnuts It costs 5 cents to make your sandwiches and I doubt the eggs in the sandwiches are even real egg The cheese is sub par Kraft slices and not even melted ever Are you kidding me with this Needless to say I will not be back 
0k4GNDt92pyeu3hDYdD_fA CMU For the price average rooms and beds has all the usual amenities pretty standard I d give it 3 stars But definitely plus a star I d do plus a star and a half if I could for two specific things Most of the older staff seemed meh not rude but not particularly nice either but two of the younger staff in particular Zach and a younger girl I didn t catch the name of were exceptional 1 We missed the shuttle when it was raining and Zach quickly offered to drive us and in 2 minutes pulled up another vehicle Was a courteous driver when it seemed like no one else on the road was and was very friendly drove us right to the door of where we needed to be Incredible staff member very friendly and helpful Will try to find a way to let the management know how excellent he is 2 Then on the last day we realized we forgot about late check in ran down to the front desk and got it taken care of as simply as Me is it too late to do late checkin Girl nope what room time Me room x time y Girl writes it down you re all set Extremely simple was able to catch some more sleep before leaving Given these two experiences our stay was definitely better than what we expected 
0KG85zj1wSkpjdP46yit1A CMU My wife and I went here and our overall feeling was meh We had the corn fritters and some kind of salad to start The former was bland and the latter consisted of spring mix from Giant Eagle with some added veggies For an entree we shared the tilapia which was beautifully prepared but not very tasty And it cost 20 for tilapia I can get 5lbs of the stuff for 20 at Whole Foods Anyway the atmosphere is nice and the staff were very friendly but for the price it s not worth it at all I can spend the same at say Dinette and get a MUCH better meal The truth is that we re really sad about this We love La Ferria in Shadyside and since we live i Squirrel Hill we were very excited to have something like it within walking distance Unfortunately it did not deliver I think we ll give them a few months to work things out and try it again If it s as bland then as it was now we ll be skipping this eatery 
0kwMdCCTXxfo3COcZ9tzmA CMU This place is ok and i haven t been here more than once But i ve given three stars for this place because my friend always goes there and collects fortune cookies for me I collect the fortunes so most of my papers were from Orient Express So do go here to get fortune cookies I ts close to CMU and its very cheap It s a good place to go to when you are really hungry and you want to save some money Saving is good after all Smriti 
0l1OqNI9ryRtrHTV2o3Rnw CMU The bartender at this bar was so incredibly rude to us that we left before ordering anything The fully story can be found here http livingaustria wordpress com 2011 12 01 phi stands for pub house of insolence I will NEVER return to this bar and HIGHLY recommend NOT going here to anyone else I would give this bar zero stars if that were possible 
0L9jtXV7oAOqwBhOEH_qzw CMU I can t believe the less than great reviews for Pamela s I also can t believe that I ve never reviewed this place before despite it being right around the corner from me Well I woke up yesterday with an appetite for a really good breakfast So borrowing an idea from a really good friend of mine I decided to take my guy out to eat Well he must have really had a great appetite himself because he ordered the bannana walnut pancakes Carbs Calories Fat Mmmm just thinking about that Pump that insulin Susan Pump Well I am a type 1 diabetic and even though I opted for the slightly less carb a lish ous pancakes and an egg on the side I still was pumping that insulin cos their cakes are s o o o o good The menu even bills them as The Devil s Carb Corner Hey a girl can t eat just scrambled eggs all her life A couple of things though Pamela s does have a lunch menu but they don t serve these on Sunday Also the place is CASH ONLY so be sure to stop at the ATM beforehand 
0lmAGDDGwFSTCLtV9EzyfQ CMU The menu is on the wall and the food is prepared at the counter you order at All the seating is upstairs The staff was decently friendly and the place is clean but mostly stark The sushi is just okay and the wasabi tastes of cheap horseradish On the whole a worthy inexpensive place to get some sushi 
0Lu0grH_l1IGGu-_mt7k7A CMU You will be impressed by the beautiful decor but even more wowed by the professional service Enjoy organic coffee or a great glass of wine during your visit Conveniently located in the heart of the Shady Side business district this spa shows careful attention to every detail of your visit 
0luhcwW9NEjxcqMWMAgm5w CMU Do they have the best service no Is their food that great uhm it s ok I ve had a good Reuben sandwich I ve had ok pasta but is their French Strawberry pie with a thin layer of chocolate in the crust worth a pilgrimage that required me driving an hour one direction to get it in season YES it is that good Their carrot cake is also stupendous The raspberry chambord thing is my mother s favorite If they ever have lemon cheesecake when you re there it s phenomenal Dont expect to be dazzled by the menu or the service but getting French Strawberry pie in May is worth going to Gullifty s Honest it s worth it 
0lv-8-lZ7H0fnr-LmIOJAA CMU GREAT place to grab frozen yogurt and great concept of being able to mix and match YOUR choice flavors and YOUR choice of toppings You choose your own combination of yogurt flavors banana mango taro raspberry etc your own mix of fresh fruit mango blueberries strawberries etc candy M M s Reese s gummy bears brownie bites etc or your favorite dry toppings granola oreos nuts coconut etc and then pay based on weight There are also different syrups you can choose from caramel chocolate peanut butter etc The taro flavor is great 
0lZqE6HKGw5JiEQrDCiORQ CMU Jimmy Johns is fast So fast that they forgot to put sprouts on my tuna sandwich Considering that was the primary reason I got said tuna salad sandwich I m pretty bummed The tuna salad itself is chunk light tuna not even whole albacore and has a pretty fishy taste to it I ll give em another try and hopefully bump this review up another star 
0M4GS1iNcRxccdGB2XaNwQ CMU Because I m vegetarian Bibimbap was the only item I could order on the menu If you are vegetarian make sure you do NOT drink the soup that comes with Bibimbap because it contains fish fat oil It was a great experience because it was the first time I ve seen a dish separated by flavors For example if you order pasta you re pretty much taking a bite of the same thing for your entire meal With Bibimbap everything is separated into different sections and you get four or five side dishes like kimchi The food was great but its not really filling My friends say its mediocre compared to other restaurants and food they get back home 
0mpgIfPs3OQli0hPYWhYeQ CMU Awesome place with some very unique dishes Everything is good but you gotta get the shrimp and grits for an appetizer 
0MRevFr0LghQNKyJ3PvHHg CMU Their food is just okay I ve tried several of their dishes and only like one My friend and I tried their almond and taro milk tea and they were terrible I don t think they used tea to make the milk TEA They taste like they mixed the taro almond powder with water 
0MYXgNT1h88dCdGkIjBt3w CMU Walter s is just a fantastic establishment Tim is a phenomenal mechanic who is as honest as they come charges amazingly low prices and Morten H is not lying will actually suggest ways to save you money The shop is small and usually pretty busy but they will do their best to fit you in and get your car fixed up ASAP and Tim always takes time to explain your car s problems to you He will even show you what s wrong inside the car or tell you how to do something yourself if that s what would be more sensible I recommend Walter s to anyone who s in the market for a mechanic 
0N35bh01Jlgc9FSyRRUb8Q CMU Rittes is a classic old style diner in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh It has great diner food and of course great breakfast It has been a well know sober up place for years 
0N8aOTds6tQkAAJDBOlRvg CMU been back a few times for dinner and it s quite good their spicy beef tendon is great 
0NCpycdpYkxuyrioaDUvOg CMU Maybe it s because I don t know my gelato but I thought this place was just A OK There was nothing memorable or special about the gelato or the creamery shop 
0NSx78XlZcUGsDnSglIl0A CMU It s probably dumb to review a chain fast food restaurant but I will do it anyway Such is my devotion to Yelp I like that this Chipotle has a parking lot it makes it much easier to satisfy our cravings for burrito deliciousness Every time I ve been here the staff has been very friendly It looked to me like their scoops of rice meat and salsa were a bit meager but I didn t say anything about it Largely because Chipotle can be pretty high calorie as it is I don t usually count these things but I did today for kicks and my burrito was 810 calories and I didn t even get sour cream But on the bright side they claim to use organic produce cows without hormones sustainably raised ingredients and you don t hear that often from a fast food joint The food always tastes fresh My burrito was a little colder than I d like it maybe they re all that way and I m just picky but I had to put it in the oven to bring it to a good temperature Nonetheless it was very tasty as always it being a chicken burrito with corn salsa and cheese omnomnom It s a lot of food and the price is right 
0nzMw-pek3a1GXOgznGtvQ CMU Great little theater Only been there a couple times and have always enjoyed myself mostly because its never crowded My favorite experience is when we went to see inglorious basterds there were a lot of older Jewish couples in the theater and when Hitler got his face shot into swiss cheese they all started laughing and cheering I thought it was cute 
0O-CLcx8TnrXk7Brb7pQVA CMU Decent food nice space and attentive service Two in my party ordered the duck curry and both seemed to enjoy it Another ordered pad thai and I had the pineapple curry Mine was tasty but not at all spicy even though I requested a 7 10 spiciness We all ordered tom yum soup and I found it to be not nearly as good as I am used to eating elsewhere I also thought the rice to curry ratio was lacking and that the food was a bit overpriced Our waitress was very efficient My water glass was always full and it did not take long to receive our meal have leftovers wrapped or to settle the bill The space is pretty large and they have some pretty cool lights on the ceiling The bathroom was clean I would come back here for Thai food if in the area but I would stress that I want to feel the heat and would not order the soup again 
0O3eDR1db5qsJHIKyqWpKA CMU Comfy little Squirrel Hill coffee shop I pretty much only order my usual decaf black but there is a nice selection of coffee drinks and sweets on the counter My favorite aspect is the little outdoor patio with lights strung up above It s the perfect place to spend a summer evening catching up with a friend Indoors it can get very crowded with students studying and you d be better off if your laptop had a strong battery because it can be difficult to get an outlet Even with the crowd though it never gets very loud because most people have their noses in books and headphones in their ears 
0ObZrgF9xWDxor4UP0iQ2g CMU Of all the neighborhood bars I ve had living in seven different locations in Pittsburgh over the past 12 years Hough s is by far my favorite Here s why it s awesome 1 Excellent beer selection I admit it I m a bit of a beer novice I stick to what I know lagers pilsners and the occasional brown ale However for real beer lovers this is a great place I believe they have something in the range of 50 60 beers on TAP at any given time Not to mention the bottle selection Growlers to go if you re interested 2 WANGZ Wednesday is wing night It s packed Why Because these wings are big juicy freshly made you ll wait 10 15 min per order warning clearly stated on the menu and the sauces dry dubs are A MAH ZING that s for you MH 3 Buttered toasted buns on all the sandwiches burgers May seem like a trivial thing but I tell you when you chomp into a Chicken Cheese Steak and you get a burst of buttery toasted goodness you ll know what I m talkin bout One downside which I won t even factor into my overall rating is that they are closed on Sunday s except Steeler Sundays of course they aren t uncivilized I feel like Hough s could really corner the Sunday afternoon breezy beer drinking occasion Eh I guess bartenders can have days off too PS The chili also rocks Try it on their house made chips PPS This review makes me want to run a few miles and eat a salad 
0oSD_6PtQjJc_V417gr6nA CMU There s not much to say in terms of this being a regular Hampton If you don t have transportation though this is a convenient place to stay hence the four stars Apparently Super Shuttle comes here for 25 each way I had my own rental car I think parking was in the teen dollar amount e g 15 day but the hotel didn t charge me for parking after all nice A shuttle runs per your request within a 3 mile radius of the hotel You can tell the very nice and friendly shuttle guy anywhere you want to go within this distance He ll also give good recommendations for dinner or shopping I think the shuttle starts running at 7AM double check me but it definitely stops running at 10PM Basically whenever you re done you call a number shuttle guy will give you a card and a driver will come pick you up Even though I had a rental car I used the shuttle because it was easier than finding parking downtown expensive to park It is because of this the hotel gets four stars The room itself and breakfast is your typical Hampton I did find it odd that at a little after 5PM the housekeeping service guy was servicing the room across the hall My room still hadn t had any housekeeping service I was only staying two nights so I didn t need extra towels but I did take shampoo conditioner lotion off of the cart and he didn t seem to be too concerned I guess I am just so used to hotels banging on the door early in the morning Nevertheless I would probably stay here again due to the convenience of where I need to be for work 
0piApcEwiNERyveWEgvoDg CMU Sunday nights after 9 are half price food and margaritas Saturdays between 6 8 are also half price food and margaritas The margaritas are loaded with booze but taste so good Lets just say if you re a lightweight you ll be tapping after 1 You can either get the regular margarita or one of the flavored one Or you can mix two flavors together which is also really good After 2 of the big ones you get a very healthy buzz going on 3 well you ll have a more than healthy buzz and a ridiculous sugar rush 4 haven t seen it yet The sugar usually gets to you first As for the food this is great Mexican food I usually get a burrito and piggy size it so they put double the meat in I really don t need to get double meat because the serving sizes are enormous but after doing it the first time I can t possibly go back Mad Mex is one of the reasons why a lot of people get the freshman 15 and the sophomore 30 The food and drinks are soo good that you can t just say no There usually is quite a bit of a wait if you go for half price food but it s still worth the wait You can hang out at the bar and grab some free nachos and salso to go with a margarita while you wait for your food Definitely worth hitting up 
0podLF5-1FIm4n0mUcYKEg CMU I m so happy I ve found Hair Friends I think I ve been going there for about 2 years now I think and I have NEVER been disappointed I go to Glen and he is amazing I will go in with a style in mind and he ll take that style and make it work for me telling me what he s going to change He explains and asks me everything before he starts so I know what s going on He and everybody else there really knows what they re doing My cuts are 32 and you can t go wrong with that 
0PVUfUK0s75GKBtoiV30AQ CMU I started coming to the Laundry Factory over a year ago This place is wonderful It s so nice to come to clean and comfortable place I ve done mine laundry there and I ve used their wash n fold service Both are great Employees are helpful and friendly One of them saved me from spending a lot on dry cleaning when my comforter could safely be washed in a regular machine Their dry cleaning service is also reasonably priced and I ve had no complaints As long as I live in the east side of the city I will keep coming here 
0QhgHZi7jeL8XRsaCcPrJQ CMU Oh My I keep telling myself It s okay Susan you can have this for your snack when your BGs go low Contrary to popular belief we diabetics CAN have a cookie or a piece of cake indeed we must sometimes but we have to watch our carbs and take enough insulin to cover Having said that where to begin about this place How about with their famous burnt almond torte These things are so good they can now ship them anywhere They make a travel torte version with their wedding creme custard which doesn t require refrigeration Sigh but I usually limit myself to their cookies and their fine bread As I said on another review of mine Pump that insulin Susan 
0QoWSweZXrvkgZY9JzfiXA CMU As someone who works at a local boutique I always run to the defense of small stores in Pittsburgh just because of my personal investment and I enjoy the solidarity in it Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I hate to prove people wrong because of that but I also wouldn t want something to be written misleading about a store I love I can possibly understand what Kaitlyn R wrote about an employee and it can not be testified to because who knows how someone acted at a certain point on a certain day With that said I have always found Dina Ellen to be one of the friendliest boutiques in Pittsburgh always happy to help to the best of their ability Pushiness can always be misconstrued for enthusiasm But when I saw the review about the shoes specifically the UGG leather Elyza sandal I wanted to make sure that this wasn t true because I do put my trust in the local stores and supporting them is more important to me than what Zappos or Nordstrom could ever offer So I did I little research The sandal to which Kaitlyn R is referring to is the exact same price as on Zappos and isn t even on the Nordstrom website so what they are selling it for I could not say http www zappos com product 7963165 color 23588 zfcTest fw 0 Well you would actual be paying more on Zappos because of shipping As far as contacting The UGG company I m sure they would appreciate the price of the shoes they actually had problems with Dina Ellen running to many UGG sales in the past Dina Ellen also carries Frye boots which I love The Frye Company is great to work with especially with their repairs Jeffery Campbell Charlotte Ronson and Joie are great shoe companies they carry as well but are harder to get repaired especially if they are from past seasons It s hard with the Internet today for locally owned stores I feel like they are a dying breed To keep up with sales discounts and corporate stores it s a daily battle Inventory is hard because small boutiques want to be special and not over carry anything and at the same time they want to have room and money for different things Boutiques can t repair and return everything that a corporate stores can because they don t necessarily have the means to I m sure in the future Dina Ellen would appreciate the constructive criticism no one wants an unsatisfied customer 
0QtTVEkLjPOu4XmB9KYxWQ CMU Disappointed in quality of overall meal the meats and breads were OK The pierogies were NOT good too doughy and greasy 
0r6mmARKN2_duxeGfumjUQ CMU Murray Ave Grill is essentially the only American restaurant in Sq Hill so they ve got you cornered if you just want a steak or salad The space isn t bad but they play 50 s music which just doesn t go with anything in there The service is usually nice and attentive They ve got a decent beer selection and the drinks flow until 2am When the weather s nice there s outdoor seating and they also have Sunday brunch 
0RFOneh7DBVilFoHl0nFvw CMU The only reason that I am giving this restaurant 2 stars is for the atmosphere location and idea This is one of those places that survive solely on sight The restaurant itself is very nice and located right next to the park I love love love the porch theme and atmosphere except it can be noisy Now the food on the other has a lot to be desired Eat n Park needs to evaluate what type of food that the offerings should be here They can not continue to venture into other types of dining while continuing to do the same old foods Just because it has a fancy name is isn t fancy I had the Grilled Farm Bread Sandwich Fried Egg house cured pork belly Vermont Cheddar Crispy Taters this basically equated to a bacon scrambler with over easy eggs cheddar cheese on Italian Bread which is something like 6 99 at eat n park compared to 9 00 here That is not upscale a nice plate with a nicer atmosphere has to have better food My wife had the RUSTIC BREAD SALAD Grilled Sourdough Bread Cherry Tomatoes Fresh Mozzarella Fris e Radicchio Housemade Coppa Basil Pesto the bread was burnt leaving an aftertaste and the basil pesto sauce was awful For 11 00 I expect a lot more Eat n Park got the decor location and atmosphere correct but they need to think outside the box when it comes to the food We really wanted to like this place 
0rhI-dNfsPcS9YhGuyCuWQ CMU When we re visiting a new place we love to check out the botanic garden or conservatory On our fourth visit to Pittsburgh we decided the time was right to check out Phipps Not only does Phipps have an outstanding display of plants they have some amazing pieces of Chihuly glass integrated into the conservatory One of the most stunning examples hangs in the entry way of the building On a more practical note there is free parking in the island area right on the street in front of the building It may be a little tricky to find a spot but people returning to their vehicles seemed more than happy to make us aware they were leaving 
0ROgN_mQhprPghB43Bhl6w CMU Excellent salon I always have my hair cut and styled just how I want it The stylists are friendly without being pushy The prices are reasonable and I love their product line 
0sAq-zGUEENirAJ83xtEcQ CMU The service here was very friendly and our food was delivered quickly We really like the large portion sizes and the relaxed and quiet atmosphere I didn t read other reviews before I went so I was a bit surprised to see all of the Peruvian craft and jewelry items for sale in the same space as the restaurant seating but I thought it was all beautiful and only added to the nice cafe atmosphere Not really a Friday night date destination but definitely a good place to get a bite to eat 
0sXb49DJSReNwDXkW0MXMg CMU I went to school at CMU and while I was there everyone seemed to love this place but I never got too into it Its best feature is that after 10pm you can get a 22oz Margarita for 7 which is probably the cheapest way to get yourself on the way to a good evening at a bar in Pittsburgh The margaritas themselves are nothing too special however people who are on their second may say differently this includes me The food is fine but nothing special and the place is extremely loud crowed and dark It takes a while to get a table and even if you just want to stand at the bar it is often hard to find a good spot Also for college students there is the added irritation that they enforce a rule that if anyone at the table is under 21 then nobody can drink unless you have somebody over 25 
0SzzfhBgAvCYTvMKpzcAEA CMU Had two pairs of jeans tailored Great turn around time great pricing quality work was okay 
0t7cZ2nSVON2HzftG2Jsiw CMU Love it Great location and plenty of books movies cds and whatever you d expect from a library Special bonus electric piano upstairs sheet music awesome I love that it manages to be a main branch without being intimidating I ve been to main libraries in other larger cities that were bigger and more comprehensive but not enjoyable to visit CLP Main is very cozy and comforting Also check out the free events programs they have available like their film screenings I ve also heard nice things about their language classes 
0tEPU2xSWNGNA_Ffe_lIXg CMU Great service and expertise Knowledgable specialist and great facilities The UPMC network is very streamlined connected and efficient 
0tj0V5klVZtWOvWCbR5llg CMU Ya Can t go wrong with this place tis a Pittsburgh pastime 
0TkJ4SpFbtjxFxyCT5olFA CMU Pad thai can be spicy 
0tL3g0AinFjD0IyMz1xG6Q CMU one of the best places for breakfast ever It gets packed every weekend with students parents and locals alike don t be afraid to put your name in and wait the little bit to get an amazing breakfast the interior is pretty festive with old school board games all over the walls and ceiling Has some of the standards of breakfast such as pancakes hotcakes eggs omelets etc but also has their spin on it this is a cash only restaurant so make sure that you have plenty of cash in order to pay for this meal I really liked the western style omelet that i got which had chorizo sausage in it so good 
0UruiMYPh_FEurypI7pK4w CMU It is rare for me to really rate chain stores but this is an experience to avoid if possible it is only an alternative to Chipotle if the line at Chipotle is incredibly long you re on a terrible time crunch and there s no parking at Chipotle In other words it s a terrible terrible replacement to Chipotle The concept may seem very similar to Chipotle but do not be fooled by the Spanish esque name At 5 p m on a Monday night Chipotle is already buzzing with the dinner rush but here at Qdoba there are only two tables occupied I believe that the menu tries to compete with Chipotle by having more variety and options but I think that the lack of focus contributes to a lack of quality in the food At this particular location these were some of the issues 1 When you get to the food display to place your order the food does not look fresh This of course is a concern because it may be the case that the food has been sitting out for hours which could result in some food poisoning 2 For a Mexican grill the food does not appear authentic At least a Chipotle the pico de gallo at least has a balanced portion of tomates onions and cilantro At Qdoba it just looked like diced tomatoes 3 The flavors are off When the food is all put together it tastes not like how a taco burrito should be 4 The area in which customers orders are assembled is not clean Food bits are everywhere At Chipotle it s almost spotless Overall you should just go to Chipotle instead 
0uTiACce_DHSxu06gVxc_w CMU I went to Pizzutti s with my mom and was really happy with the whole experience I ordered some sort of fettuccine pesto dish that was excellent and my mom ordered a fish dish They seemed to have a good spread of authentic ish Italian dishes this is no Buca di Beppo One thing I was not prepared for was how upscale it was I felt under dressed wearing a nice blouse and jeans It was also VERY quiet we went in at 5 and I felt like I was eating in library until some other patrons came in around 5 30 This seems like it would be a fantastic place for a date if you were willing to shell out the cash They don t serve alcohol although I believe that you can BYO without a corkage fee If you re not picky about your wine selection they do have both a house red and white that they offer you free of charge I liked the house white and thought it complemented my pasta well but I don t know much about wine Our waiter was really nice and made sure to tell us all the details about the dishes and which ones he liked He was even patient with my mom when she asked him which dishes on the menu had fresh vs dried pasta One last note they do not accept credit cards but they have an ATM in the restaurant Very strange 
0vam5ljHJZKSOWOaBbGMsQ CMU As soon as the new store opens my husband and I will be there ASAP Best gelato better than ice cream and so SO many good flavors I nearly had an emotional breakdown right on Copeland when I saw they had vacated their previous location I thought they were gone for good So happy to find out they are just moving 
0VCP1GbNFWbmyc7m-BDOlg CMU Not the best pizza in the world it s also not the worst but at 5 why complain 
0VzrRR7dsDfmakTHLw4xtA CMU If you re looking for a late night greasy fried food fix this is the place to come sadly I live a mere minutes distance from this place Their kitchen is usually open until 3 30am and if I ve been out in shadyside I often come here for a slice of pizza on my walk home They also have six packs for carry out which is useful sometimes Last time i went with a group of friends we tried one of their hugee calzones jalepeno poppers and the wings Its a really small place and their bar seems to never be really busy like shady grove or marios but it is a chill place to just get good bar food I always crave their pizza and chicken tenders yum 
0wMiKzzENVBvMvgs_2GrjA CMU Nothing too fancy if you re looking for something easy and casual this is a good place Outdoor seating is a plus Nice selection of beer and you can make your own pizza there is even a wheat crust option Pizza is cheap 20 for a large which can serve 3 4 people There are sandwich options too though I did not order one Waitress was sweet and got the job done Thumbs up 
0xazGXUh6mOMYX-O1H3TNQ CMU to me this is my favorite grocery store in pittsburgh plus shopping there gets ya discounts on fuel which helps alot nowadays from flowers to fresh sushi it has it all a good meat selection with a ton of variety in the case olive bar fresh fish a ton of vegetables huge selections of cheeses and prepared foods as well not to many people there at night time makes it easier to shop quickly but also means all of the departments with cases are closed free samples most days as well and a chef that cooks up something and has the recipe next to the food and you get to sample it all and all i love this giant eagle 
0XgY9oQSl0heg0CS2sLlyA CMU This is actually an outpost of Sree s restaurant in Squirrel Hill Despite the somewhat low rent appearance of the trailer the food is actually really good I would generally recommend the veg lunch but only because those dishes are delicious If you need meat they also have pretty good chicken even though it s all white meat My only complaint is their chutney but that s because I happen to really like mango chutney And yes the bread truly sucks fortunately there s more than enough food as it is Sree did have a a white guy serving up food at some point but so what I don t see why you need to be an ethnic to serve ethnic food In any case I m pretty sure he wasn t the cook The last time I was there it was a nice Indian lady short enough to fit into the trailer All in all I ve found this to be really nice place to get decent South Indian food not that far off from what you might find on the sub continent and not the fancy stuff you end up with in a restaurant in this area Check it out 
0XVE0S1bWvEnUzraou51OQ CMU I have been to the week end buffet a couple of times I am not sure if they re still doing it but it was absolutely mind blowingly good Expensive 20 which is more like NYC prices But good home cooked traditional Korean dishes that to me are like Asian soul food Recommended if for just once in awhile due to the high cost the buffet is ONLY on Sundays 
0YnMEx3SkPU490WbQoBFBg CMU Had the reuben which was good and big enough for two Will try the veal parmagian sandwich next time 
0Z4DIDSQ0Z6eOK5-JoOo6w CMU Came here a lot during my CMU days Good beer selection and yummy pizzas and there s a half off menu after 11pm 
0ZbtQtpXUDeGPQeI3-9uGw CMU I see people sitting in Jitters chairs outside all the time and I like the decor so I really really want to like this place but the first time was the last time The service was horrible and their coffee didn t taste great I waited for ten minutes at least before the two people manning the cashier bar before I was paid attention to and serviced as they were busy chatting with one of their friends who had stopped in After getting my coffee they were low on the sugars and milks and other fix ins so was not pleased even further especially for what I paid for a small coffee 
0ZTSuaOyPCck-_KczDsB-Q CMU It would now be impossible for me to count the evenings I have spent at 61c With free internet good hot chocolate and desserts and also amazing fresh smoothies I am set for hours The music is very good The staff are great go there enough and you will soon be friends with them 
0zZeYK5ES2s_w4VS6fEx0w CMU The best thing is the academics The faculty is near or at the top of their field in so many areas computer science drama engineering robotics design music decision science and cognitive psychology to name a few The character and achievements of the faculty draw similarly brilliant and committed students There is also the possibility to develop very different skills to a very high level Students frequently double major or major and minor across schools within the university or create self defined majors which bridge disciplines The diversity in backgrounds and in interests is a huge strength as students are constantly surrounded by different viewpoints The administration is helpful and treats students like adults They take safety very seriously and everyone in the campus community receives emails when an incident occurs It got me into a PhD program in France I will always remember walking out of Newell Simon hall at sunset after the final exam of the hardest course of my undergraduate career to the sound of bagpipes in the distance 
0_5WV5dagGSRjqNHQXvfSw CMU Burger quest continues I had heard a lot of good things about Five Guys Hearing good things about a fast food joint is always surprising The final verdict Perhaps a slight notch up from McD s or Burger King The fries were actually very good I love crispy fries that haven t been sitting there for hours or days and they were high on the crispy o meter Plus the single helping was ginormous Enough for two people fo sho On the burger side meh I ordered what I thought was a regular cheeseburger Thankfully the chick at the register told me their regular is actually a double patty Um this truly is an influence of American culture super sizing Ok I m getting off my box now I opted for the single patty which was the little hamburger Little normal portion Keep that in mind when ordering The burger itself was ok Definitely not life changing And believe me I ve had myself a life changing burger in the burgh Cough cough Wingharts cough cough So if McDonald s and Five Guys were the last Fast Food restaurants on earth I would go with Five Guys Not saying much right 
0_65h4dWSC43eFSpeftJtg CMU A huge plus to having a mac is being able to take your computer to someone who works at a place you can go and have a conversation in person Always superior service by people who really know what they are talking about and really value you as a customer I love the apple store 
0_aqnnGfvAMyilJjPC58Dw CMU Tom is an excellent barber and a very respectful man The haircuts are great and can be made ahead of time just by calling him or you can sometimes walk in and wait for him to squeeze you in It is inexpensive especially when you are getting a scissors cut with a straight razor shave Try him out you will definitely be a returning customer 
1-UopBZnYfIJMgZZgmxlqw CMU There is a certain sartorial magic that happens when you try on a pair of chinos and instantly know that you two are destined for each other And that you can afford said bewitching accoutrements Spirit Fingers Yes it s usually expensif But keep an eye out for the sales they always seem to have something on offer in store or online This store has a pretty decent selection and friendly service I can usually find what I want in my size It s BR you get good quality modern clothes I also appreciate that BR offers emailed receipts in addition to paper copies 
10WN186BwrSHW3kqyiUmpw CMU If you re a college student in Pittsburgh odds are at some point or another you ve been here for dessert I will say on a college budget you get a lot of good reasonably priced food here Can it compete with the best of NYC no of course not but that isn t where you are is it Get a reuben and chase it down with a piece of cheesecake Go home happy Quit whining about how Pittsburgh isn t NYC 
12YOCJb0zuKue-F7ysHGSg CMU This place started out being great but it seems that every time I go there the food gets more expensive and the margaritas get weaker It s a really popular place but I am not on the bandwagon 
13NDRCtA5vNEw-xKPgqi0w CMU insanely good fries real good hot dogs great place to get a late night twelve pack or some 40s After Superbowl XL my buddy kept buying 40s and immediately dropping them outside during the revelry Never once did he get hassled 
14ElTxIaRhNURQOWg2foFg CMU Ever think back to your early 20s You know when you were single and had your first apartment When you did your own budgeting and your own grocery shopping for the first time Ever look back at the neighborhood you lived in the places you went Me I lived in Greenfield from the time I was 23 up til I got married at age 27 I used to satisfy my pizza cravings here and I remember it being great pizza at an absolutely hole in the wall place I m proud to say it hasn t changed a bit Rick and I just wanted some takeout for dinner and since I was looking back at some of my old reviews I thought we d check out Conicella once again M m m m Greasy yummy bad for you pizza We ordered the white pizza with sausage hot peppers mushrooms on it Terrific Especially if you re like me and you fold your slice as you eat it I know my Chicago friends are cringing at the thought of eating it that way 
15R57_1QuueA_8pDBwOfhQ CMU Love the pie though I m a little under impressed with the white pizza Like that they offer other food besides pizza And not to mention you can grab a 6 pack 
15xPmIdSnhdB0paD5SoZJQ CMU Excellent place for a quick cheap lunch Menu is full of cheap eats and healthful fare can be found here too I ve twice had lunch there for two for under 15 The lentil soup and tabbouleh salad are great In and out in 30 45 mins easy Tight seating though most tables are for two 
15zwHX9tWCVuvTZYqUGJ3A CMU I should probably write two reviews because I absolutely love Shelly but Roman has now jacked up my do twice I won t be going back to see him again I have been a client of Shelly s for at least 4 years and have gone to Dan Cercone s barber shop up until November 2011 because I was going from a tight cut to a razored out shag and thought that using a salon would be my best option Using Roman was last minute and boy did I get the last minute treatment twice He has successfully screwed up my hair two times with a photo sample to follow of what I want on both trips Great conversation but I think he forgets what the intended goal is when someone is in his chair FYI The photo attached to this account is NOT what my hair looks like now 
16qhn2sP4A5Dkfi82v9hFw CMU I travel to Pittsburgh pretty often and the owner who cooks the crepes recognizes my wife and me every single time we re there The crepes are excellent the prices are more than reasonable and as long as you don t go there during a peak period it s never too crowded 
17gouKU9t0NN4Se2HcK5Qg CMU I find it amusing that my very first taste of Indian food was when I was 23 years old and in Pittsburgh of all places But I couldn t have picked a better place to pop that cherry because the first thing I noticed when I wandered into India Garden for lunch one day was all the accolades posted on the wall I ve been here for the lunch buffet several times and while I don t know from authentic when it comes to Indian food I know that I loved it and I ve been enamored with Indian cuisine ever since 
181oX3k6Og2LLgLCxwhG6Q CMU I went to Legume for the first time a few weeks ago The atmosphere service and food were excellent We made a reservation for a Friday night The food is very fresh local and best of all delicious When eating the first bites of my food I paused to enjoy all of the flavors Also bring a bottle of your favorite wine 
18G6h_sQuoAf7nOV-Sw1wg CMU This food was g ross We got a meatball sub cold no sauce salty minimal meat meatballs sliced in half that was dry and tasted bad as opposed to the preferable option of tasteless the Chicken Ranchero was a mess of mushroom no lettuce tomato ranch or bacon AND it had sweet peppers on it In short it was the wrong sub Ordered online so I don t know how they got the wrong order YIKES do not order from here This place makes Subway look like a five star restaurant Go there instead eat fresh AND we just found out they sent us the wrong sub Instead of rectifying it the manager hung up on us stating they didn t have time to deal with it Probably because of all the other wrong orders 
18N7_aBsXDbb7DNGT-CLlQ CMU This is a great place to just hang out and study The regulars are nice people Unfortunately you do have to buy something to use the internets 
18vszhYmPbCyWw6LQT83-g CMU Excellent sushi overall one of the two best Japanese restaurants I ve ever been to Not that I m a huge Japanophile but I thought their salad and fried chicken were incredible and I know this is patronizing but I appreciated being in a Japanese place that s run by actual Japanese Dining room is extremely cozy meaning very small so I wouldn t hit it if I want an intimate dinner but it s a great place for a casual meal with awesome food I ll be back soon for non sushi dinner and I m highly confident that it will be good 
18_EAQu2-g64xkr4kW-EEg CMU I ve only been there once so take this for what it s worth I was in Squirrel Hill yesterday looking for a place to grab a bite to eat and saw this spot They had a veggie portabella sub which caught my eye I m an omnivore but was feeling like having something a little less heavy than the meat options so I opted for this sandwich Big mistake This portabella sandwich with provolone tasted more like Chinese food on a roll than anything close to an Italian sandwich The mushrooms were fried in way too much corn oil fully saturating the bread to the point where it couldn t be held together as a sandwich The provolone cheese was very low quality pretty much tasteless and did nothing for me I find that often sandwich shops will have a vegetarian option just for the purpose of offering herbivores something edible while their friends enjoy the real menu The fact that a sandwich lacks meat shouldn t have to mean that it lacks flavor If you guys are knowingly making vegetarian sandwiches that you wouldn t eat that s not a symptom of them being veggie sandwiches but a demonstration of your lack of willingness to take the time to figure out how to make a tasty veggie option Figure it out 
195SH5gu1mxXJXnRRhs0uA CMU I don t think I would ever go back here It was quite overpriced and the food was strikingly bland Also if you re a caucasian chef don t try to serve Asian dishes unless you have a clue It s effing embarrassing My risotto was ZzZzZzZzzzzzzzzzzzzz How hard is it to make good risotto ya dummy 
19TAsvgGboX_c_ZsxnxAmQ CMU i asked the chef to create something vegetarian since I didn t see alot of items on the menu It was fantastic Jalapeno risotto with greens and some other items I was very impressed and will return Upscale but relaxed loved it 
1A0qYIIXOOHmc5dTMXl4_w CMU After previous bad experiences at Red Oak I d stopped going there for a few months Today I decided to give them a second try hoping maybe the staff had changed over enough for them to have improved Boy was I wrong I ordered 2 salads both of which came with old lettuce a few pieces of romaine were red throughout the stem and mine had a few rotten tomatoes one was black for half of it The final straw While eating his Ceasar salad my friend cut his mouth on a sharp hard piece of plastic I called before walking back to the store and the guy on the phone said they would be willing to make things better When I got back to the restaurant the manager walked up pulled 7 out of the drawer threw it at me and said have a good day without even asking me what was actually wrong or trying to see what the problem was My question to Red Oak after reading all the bad reviews here How do you expect to make things better if you won t even listen to what is wrong 
1A0X91rpzTnMIR3ImGdBQg CMU I m a huge fan of Korean food so when I saw this place I knew I had to try it out I wasn t impressed by their bulgolgi the beef they use is definitely a cheap cut it was very stringing and I almost choked on it I will probably go back again and try some of their other dishes I agree with most people that their dishes are overpriced Be prepared to pay about 50 for two people 
1a5FOyJHhN34K0xtj5KP8A CMU There is a reason this restaurant has over 60 reviews It might not look like the greatest neighborhood but Great food at an affordable price The place was quite clean and droned a nice ambiance as well 
1AE3wCdGQ_xdWDB5m0aSqg CMU We went to The Porch recently for Sunday brunch Love the bright and open space We got a table towards in back along the banquet We were greeted right away by our super perky server For drinks BJ opted for a seasonal beer and I ordered a pineapple sage margarita I love this drink so good BJ ordered the chorizo eggs He thought it was okay But he really liked the fried potatoes I loved his meal I sampled I got the Rocket salad I loved the roasted beet and the Sherry vinaigrette I thought the chorizo was a little tough We decided to get the cookies for a sweet little treat We were told we would get 6 and we even got to pick what kind 3 peanut butter cookies and 3 white chocolate macadamia nut cranberry Somehow we only ended up with 5 We were missing one cookie We asked our server about our missing cookie and she couldn t come up with a satisfactory answer Kinda of a strange ending to an otherwise good meal 
1akJCVo8NaQ2hgreYotXyA CMU Love this place This is the best coffee in Pittsburgh The beans come to the store fresh to be roasted on site They re always ground fresh and there are typically several bean options every week The home made simple syrups provide an awesome flavor variety if you re looking for something to augment your latte I recommend the teas as well 
1bGx71p0QqntqjuGzKngIg CMU Good homestyle American fare High quality ingredients well prepared Liked the new gourmet sides of loaded potatoes and Mediterranean green beans I think the quarter dark plate with 2 sides is pretty good especially if you use one of the free soft drink or 1 coupons in the paper or from their website Service was good and restaurant super clean when I went Oh yeah pretty cool to get real plates and silverware when dining in 
1bpRjrwpt-jgtf_XQKt5Ew CMU I love Reuben sandwiches Every new place I go I must try one Smallman s has one of the best Reuben s in Pittsburgh and maybe anywhere The rye bread is perfect and grilled to perfection on the grill with butter The corned beef I mean it is Smallman s so it gets no better than their deli cuts Finally the sandwich comes with the perfect amount of kraut and dressing a good Reuben can be ruined by too much of either of these ingredients Smallman s Reuben is not the largest you will find but will definitely be the best in terms of quality you can eat And it comes with a pickle Man do I love dill pickles and Smallman s is spectacular 
1CJzOfk4PAKlG1zzdIazFA CMU Tamarind is the most authentic Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh in the beautiful setting of a restored Victorian Manson Don t go in expecting your traditional Americanized Indian Fare the restaurant has a more limited menu that focuses on artfully prepared sauces The food quality is excellent with moderate portions The prices are fair but more expensive than other Indian in the city The decor is elegant and modern with nice views if only of Craig St Parking is very limited and the neighboring Centre Ave area doesn t attract the most savory characters 
1ctSJ6xh3c8Z11MXwlQFMQ CMU Mmm Pamela s picture me saying this with the Borat accent Their pancakes SO GOOD The wait to get in sometimes SO BAD That s literally the long and short of it I pine for their deliciously thin crispy and yet soft and chewy crepe like pancakes with the brown sugar sour cream strawberries and syrup MMmmmmm Great and caloric way to start your day It just kinda sucks when it s 20 degrees outside and you re half in the door half out because they don t really have a lobby or a ton of seating Gets borderline claustrophobic crowded in there sometimes so I couldn t really give it a 5 5 stars The Walnut St location suffers from the same problem too 
1cVwx9qVxwscPGkPWeHzTg CMU Everyone raves about the desserts here but I m not sure what the big deal is I was kind of grossed out by the food and the desserts were so so tasted like the fridge sad to say I cannot recommend Perhaps quality has declined over the years On the plus side there are giant photographs of vegetables on the walls 
1D86AwJ55x8YkzaVnu6Few CMU I have had a fantastic experience with Desi Moorgi which translates basically as Indian Chicken Please note Desi Moorgi is a carryout takeout place for the most part there are one or two small tables available but this is all about great food to go Also I just want to make it clear that my experience was a big one not just a wrap and a drink to go I ordered a number of appetizers and parathas a type of flaky Indian flatbread from Jeet at Desi Moorgi for a party with about 70 people Everything that they prepared was brilliant We ordered some chicken kebabs minced chicken patties with herbs and spices garnished with onions and peppers These kebabs were a big hit We also asked for some chicken tikka rolls totally fantastic each individually wrapped think mini Indian burrito Desi Moorgi also made some fantastic vegetarian paneer farmers cheese rolls think mini Indian taquitos Desi Moorgi provided some Parathas to be served with entrees that we prepared ourselves the parathas were well prepared and perfectly packaged I am very very happy with my experience with Desi Moorgi I sampled other things from Desi Moorgi before placing my big order Their Chicken Tikka is also fantastic and they have some awesome other wraps that are absolutely fantastic On top of all of this is a really great owner proprietor Attitude and service go a long way Sincerity and a smile can not be imitated I like this place and I hope that you will try it for selfish reasons As long as they are successful and do a good book of business I will have a great go to place for takeout Indian food 
1dyjkpwmAH6U8idk_73ADg CMU I started out really disliking the food at Silky s especially where there are better bar food options within a mile But they ve won me over A little bit I ll call them average Wings still underwhelmed They are a dry rub unless you get a bbq And usually overcooked I like my wings well done but these are always so average I don t even order them here anymore Burgers and Sandwiches are pretty good Buffalo chicken wrap was solid Burger off the special menu got the job done Waffle fries very good I think because they are very crispy Based on the bacon reviews below i think the general rule is they are good at frying the hell out of something sometimes for good sometimes for bad What redeems this place beyond the average food is the layout and outdoor seating It beats other bloomfield bars given it s greater amount of seating and better views of tv screens Also it has the most outdoor seating Not tons but if you get there at a decent hour still possible to get a table Silky s usually makes the list to watch a game or if weather calls for outdoor drinking 
1e9-7aicX-LZxiZe_3oaFQ CMU This place hosts a fine selection of movies It s on a great bus line and it s surrounded by cheap places to eat and otherwise waste time but not necessarily money before the film starts The matinee crowds are great too And if the titles or times don t work for you there s always the Squirrel Hill Theatre right nearby which turns Murray Ave into a kind of old fashioned 11 plex I miss the Manor Theatre and I honestly don t think I expected to the place is a little dingy and the projection isn t always flawless But in my new neighborhood I can t walk to see I m Not There and I m sad 
1EB9Bn22baBV2qLRmxhoCw CMU Lulu s is a mediocre restaurant and it offers Japanese Chinese Korean and other Pan Asian cuisines Go to this restaurant if you want to take chances Sometimes the food comes out alright but there are other times when the food tastes like complete crap It also depends by the hours the food comes out slowly and unsatisfactory during lunch and dinner times However the food comes out faster and OK at random hours The only dish that I recommend is Thai Lemon Basil Beef with noodles Lulu s also serves bubble teas and my favorite ones are lychee flavored tea and mango smoothie with bubbles Although the food is okay I m not satisfied with the service The waitresses at Lulu s can be rude sometimes 
1Eoc0-Hro7PQdR8oK7dZEw CMU I absolutely love this cute little place located at the corner of Beacon and Murray within the Squirrel Hill neighborhood Whenever I walk in I feel like I ve walked into someone s homey little living room with a view into the kitchen The staff are incredibly chill and friendly and are definitely accommodating with mixing hot or iced tea orders My husband would label this place as hipster s version of a coffee place Their seasonal drinks are wonderful and definitely remind you of the season that they are being served During the winter time it s the wonderful aroma of the Mexican chocolate to warm up your taste buds and your fingers Nothing reminds you of the rich colors of autumn than their hot tea mulled apple cider Summer time is the perfect time for their lavender flavored lemonade or their wonderful tea spritzers There s in door and out door seating The only thing I would warn about the out door seating area is that there are a lot of cigarette butts everywhere since it s the only place that the smokers and enjoy a puff Otherwise I would highly recommend that wonderful place 
1ErTJk52fRW-5uAblAYoew CMU Cozy and comfortable our food was really good and the waitstaff friendly and efficient The mussels were great garlic madness and they split some entrees for us in the kitchen wowowow Will definitely try and revisit next time I m in Pittsburgh 
1EVEOAsghi8GnoSYqzdKVw CMU Good memories here Great Indian food late at night for college kids and I believe it was half off after a certain time The entrees can get pretty spicy so please exercise caution when ordering spiciness level If you want something filling try any of the biryanis There s a club either downstairs or next door that s thumping at that time so that might be why everything s half off 
1EWnxxhrlvYwmI7GH9pVsQ CMU This is the best authentic Japanese food you will find in Pittsburgh It s not a teppanyaki restaurant or a generic sushi bar Chaya has soba and udon nabe tonkatsu kaki fry hamachi and kampachi kama etc Great selection and good flavors You can take your Japanese friends collegues here and not feel embarassed 
1FePXjJNZFrib6fuxzOk6A CMU Wow I don t know what happened An old standby sort of let me down I decided to try to make a meal out of appetizers tapas if you re a Prius driver and I just didn t really enjoy it that much The taro spring rolls and the fancy crab rangoons were good if a bit small The chicken wrapped in pandanus leaves and the salmon dumplings were just not good at all The prices didn t match the portions or the quality either Silk Elephant I wanted to visit you one last time before leaving this town for hopefully ever and now I won t miss you anymore Mission accomplished 
1fikwPdLZCXCZngWj1JS2A CMU I am what some might refer to as a mental midget I can see you nodding already but I m going to explain anyway I lost the power cord for my MacBook Since I can t even wipe my ass without said MacBook it was an itchy irritating problem This Apple Store was the wonderfully quick solution I walked in Some guy asked me what I needed found it for me sold it to me and sent me on my way Two minutes tops And my receipt was e mailed to me as I was walking out the door I found the power cord for my MacBook So now I had two and I was out 80 I figured I d drop by the Apple Store to see if I could return the extra I walked in Some guy asked me what I needed took my e mail address and the extra charger and sent me on my way One minute tops And my refund for the full price was e mailed to me as I was walking out the door Now that I think about it I essentially borrowed a power cord from the Shadyside Apple Store for a couple days at no charge If I had friends I would want them to be this reliable friendly and easy to deal with 
1fQhAokBe-sW9RN0ZhbYPQ CMU First tried the place around 3 00 on a Sunday afternoon As we walked in a middle aged woman sat at a table next to the cash register She asked us Here or to go We said here She jerked her head to the left vaguely indicating the entire restaurant and said Sit down We wondered why she was so mad at us for coming into her restaurant We sat ordered and like we do at LuLu s got out or phones and magazines prepared to wait for a while The food came out almost immediately It was hot fast and absolutely delicious Steamed veggie dumplings were a bit bland but the dipping sauce was superb Mayalysian Satay Chicken was not a peanut sauce but a spicy red sauce Really good My Tofu Eggplant Fish Hot Pot a piping hot clay bowl filled with all of those things plus veggies was so good I didn t want it to end Luckily the portion was so huge I had enough for lunch the next day The Ginger Smoothie was made with real ginger so it had that fabulous bite Seriously good The next time we try this place we ll likely get take out since the service was so weird I won t go into boring details you ll see for yourself when you go there I m just saying the service is bad enough to make us not want to suffer through it again but not bad enough to cancel out the deliciousness of the food we definitely want to have again If the service had been friendly we d definitely have given this place 4 or 5 stars 
1FR8yOuZrCwHU8hlczYm-A CMU Normally I would at least give two stars but the service is horrendous I ve been twice and the food isn t any more or less memorable than Olive Garden Now I definitely love OG and unabashedly so but they refill your drinks salad breadsticks etc and they bring the CORRECT total for your check within 5 minutes of saying I d like my check now please D Amico s Place Not so much 
1gDWoya1OraHBrRg1sqCeA CMU after hearing so many horror stories about how long people had to wait for the blue shirts to give them service at apple stores i was not looking forward to having to go to one but i had a fantastic experience i was taken care of as soon as i walked in my problem was assessed and sure i had to wait maybe a total of ten minutes if that for an apple genius to help me with my specific problem but i didn t mind with all the toys around the store to play with let me tell you more about my specific adventure i went in with a busted ipod not knowing if they d sell me a new battery or if i d have to pay hundreds for a new device turns out they have this system now where you turn in your old device and they replace it with the same model for the cost of the part so in my case i got a brand new ipod classic which had even more GB than mine since they make them differently now for the price of a new battery brand spankin new ipod for 63 i ll take it and i have to mention the genius member i spoke to john l who was super friendly and helpful unfortunately i can t remember the names of the first two gentlemen i spoke to but they were both also excellent employees 
1gHnEafYTFLtsn47LxarVg CMU I would agree with a few other revieweres that Cappys is somewhere between a Cheers bar and a dive bar with character In a way it reminds me of that bar back home I live in Shadyside and every time I ve gone out I would say that I ve ended up at Cappys at some point maybe 30 of the time That s not too bad seeming how 54 of all stats are made up on the spot What set s Cappys apart from the other local bars is it s so small It s so small that I feel like I should know everyone there That is also a play on the atmosphere I feel like most people do know most people there Actually I may go back there tonight after writing this review I d like to reiterate the point of this review It s a bar it has alcohol It has food To me it s the atmosphere that really sells Cappys It may very well appeal to you and is worth a shot 
1gkBP-c7F7u8MmUEU_KwEg CMU Nice place attentive staff and good attention to detail in the kitchen We asked for a tasting menu with wine pairings and gave them no other guidance The meal they prepared was very appropriate in both the succession of flavors and the portion sizes Everything was very well prepared The wines were all very nice but the pairings could have been better It seemed like the person who was preparing the food menu and the person who prepared the wine listing didn t actually talk to each other I could have lived without the series of employees who came by to socialize with the couple at the table next to ours for most of the meal Having to look at someone s ass for an entire course at a time really takes away from the ambiance of a place Overall we were pleased by the meal and will go back sometime 
1gpBFsH9V4O_xiRCDFtTNQ CMU If it weren t for two friends who absolutely love Gullifty s and swear by their desert I would have only tried Gullifty s once It s not because Gullifty s is bad the desert is fine but I don t think it warrants the title of Best Desert in Pittsburgh Gullifty s is like an independent Eat N Park Portions are plentiful the atmosphere is comfortable and the food is average If that s what your e looking for this is the place to go 
1GsyAL_zCVyupPiy1wrhaQ CMU I go here whenever I make it back to Pittsburgh The Mango Pork Curry is the best writing this review makes me want to take a trip to Pitt so I can have some 
1h7FdnAWCkASd1KdNDd3qg CMU Nice and solid 3 5 stars for some solid AmericanItalian food Service was really really friendly and the portions were really generous It doesn t compare to your top rated traditional Italian joint because that s not what it is It s really more of an unpretentious mom and pop spot with consistent hearty meals Great stop for lunch or dinner and cozy family atmosphere We ate we laughed and had a very relaxed meal with coffee and dessert at the end Drinks were refilled seamlessly and leftovers carefully packaged Would definitely come by again 
1hE-GsUaX4RVXzpnAXtQNg CMU The sauces are amazing especially the mustard Pair that with brisket and the best coleslaw I ve ever had and I m a happy camper Their greens are not my favorite which is the only reason I d say 4 stars instead of 5 The owner and his wife are also incredibly nice and make a real effort to know their customers 
1hQFDM_BU1EpVoVCgvJ-Xw CMU I ve been coming here for over ten years Lulu s is Lulu s and it will never change but fortunately their Fried Tofu big plate hot and sour soup and crab rangoon have never changed and neither has my love of very unhealthy fried food if you come here for dinner the service is terrible but you ll get your food eventually if you come here for lunch your food will come out very quick and extremely hot and it may or may not arrive around the same time your dining companion s food arrives it s cheap it s greasy the spicy peanut noodle bowl is DELISH So is the fried tofu egg roll hot and sour soup crab rangoon curry and pad thai 
1i48bsHISdgLtaaB6cJKWw CMU Weird weird place I ve never been somewhere that made you feel so uncomfortable as a patron This was on a Friday night from 8 30 9 30 They close at 9 45 The sushi was good not spectacular The nice thing is that the rolls were cheaper and smaller in portion size so you could sample a few I also liked the selection of nigiri The attitude there from the menu warnings to the inclusion of a tip calculator with your bill is really weird When you open the menu you are confronted with a list of about 7 or 8 rules of engagement These range from a refusal to split a check to a line that says they occasionally at their discretion add in a 17 service charge not table occupancy related There were quite a few of these and it seem like an awful lot for a place that only seats about 25 It s BYOB yet they charge 2 for every wine or beer glass and then an extra 3 for chilling or ice They didn t open our wine but just left a bottle opener at the table The restaurant was fairly empty yet all the prime booths and the Sushi bar seats were demarcated as reserved We were the last people there and nobody ever came to claim the special seating They remained set and reserved until about 30 minutes before closing when they cleaned them off while we were eating The restaurant is almost eerily quiet except for the occasional whispering among the wait staff It seems like you aren t assigned any particular server as they all hover around your table waiting for you to want something When they aren t doing this they huddle in the corners and whisper to each other It s distracting with the lack of music Really weird place The final strangeness was that the bill is proffered in your typical black check book that contains a list of tip calculations in fluorescent green For a place that seems to average about 70 for two people with tip I don t think the weirdness is worth it 
1i4yPs9FISXxN_lZTfgWPA CMU I m a bit surprised the rating consensus isn t higher To me this is the quintessential college bar and one of the best meals in Oakland I love the Turkey Burger the beef is good too with their french fries and a tall glass of lemonade They have excellent drink prices and have some city fame for their wine specials However these deals also forced all these stipulations on the menu about loitering how long you can stay things amounts of you money you should spend etc That s a turn off The menu is simple but pleases all The inside and small outside seating areas are cozy I love going here a few times a year and I wish there was a steady twin in Philadelphia 
1i7SyIqa_bc59Cd5GpKQIg CMU The crepes here are good They are tasty and they have a variety However the crepes are extremely over price So over price that I cannot afford a drink Finally the staff is extremely rude and LOVES to make loud examples of people not familiar with their system I ve chosen never to eat here again due to the staff 
1IFA4KPya6jk4Oi_nhFfXQ CMU I m rather sad after two years of living in Pittsburgh I made my first visit to Alli Baba last night I must say I was very impressed The dinner menu includes around 10 entrees and 15 a la carte items Everything I sampled of my friends was very tasty well seasoned and very satisfying The hummus baba ghanooj salads and soups were all obviously made in house not too garlicky but had a good punch of acidity that I often miss in this type of fare If I was closer to Oakland I would frequent this place for lunch I feel like it is similar in quality to Istanbul for lunch but crushes Istanbul s Larryville location for dinner without question Beer only Wine is BYOB without a corkage from what I could tell Lastly Jenny I also had the Moussaka It was very tasty and if you think something like this or lasagna souffle etc is not going to be reheated from a big platter they made earlier that day you re fooling yourself 
1IlUN00Z0DtqBleV2uYWkw CMU I must say this place puts both of the conservatories in Chicago as well as the domes in Milwaukee to shame It is old classy large varied and their spring flower show we caught the last weekend was not only beautiful but original and clever Should be considered one of the highlights of Pittsburgh 
1IvQwEcOuDqkG2_qwa4xGw CMU Aweful service Black obese man claiming to be the manager literally kicked us out of the store 10 minutes BEFORE the store was supposed to close He was rude thoughtless and should not be in the food service Will never go to this location again 
1jhNGAVjPe2xMEJSxE7f6Q CMU I m happy to have this Get Go near where I live Because we buy our groceries at Market District we end up saving a lot on gas here On our first visit we paid about a dollar a gallon because we accumulated savings without knowing it What a great deal It s nice to have an automated fast food ordering system First you punch in everything you want into the computer it prints out a receipt you pay for it at the registers and they have it ready Today I tried their build your own burger for 3 99 There s a lot of options to put into your burger I prefer these to Five Guys Almost every visit I pick up a DVD from the RedBox Such a convenient little store One major downside is that you can t get cashback on your debit card 
1JiQpb-ci3WTvsVdtygdUQ CMU I ve been to a few happy hours here and it s a really solid place to get a drink with friends I can t recall all their happy hour deals we ve usually gone on Friday and I think their special on that day is pretty minor like 50 cents off beer or something but they have better deals on other weekdays We can always get a table at happy hour time The atmosphere is casual and comfortable Affordable food which I haven t found to be terribly special but it s fine as bar food goes We ve had various appetizers onion rings chicken fingers nachos the nachos are HUGE as I recall even our group of four had trouble finishing them I m happy to live just down the street from Silky s and I d always be up for a return visit for a drink with friends or to watch a game 
1jIVusVjZddRgw2Q_t8eWw CMU Their muffins and all their bread are the best I have found in Pittsburgh 
1jPd359oCMgv2hXbkV8MPA CMU Horrible service I have never been treated so poorly in a cafe The coffee wasn t spectacular and it was fairly expensive for what it was Head down to Starbucks or the Coffee Beanery 
1JSUp4114G3FrJelMIXDCw CMU Whenever I come to a special place like this I feel lucky we have it right in our fair city I may not be a botanist but I do know that there s some purdy flowers and plants growing at Phipps I visited for the first time during the Dale Chihuly exhibit a couple years back It was SO gorgeous I just love his work But going at night it just shined Literally they knew the right spot and the right lighting to place these amazing pieces of art that made them pop among the plants I m sure it was intentional to put this exhibit in the winter so that you can have multiple bursts of color in the usually dull winter months Going back I m glad to see that some of those Chihuly pieces are still tucked into permanent display This winter s theme was The Nutcracker They had Christmas trees decorated as the specific dances lands in the story It was a really cute idea The real beauty was the massive tree in the Victoria room I love blue and silver and this tree was decorated in that color theme It was incredible I also enjoy the orchid room It s really cool seeing the different types of orchids they have I also always think I m in the garden scene in Alice in Wonderland when the flowers are singing You too Okay maybe not but it s a nice little scene for me to think about I ve actually only been here in the winter months but it actually makes me think I need to visit sometime in the spring summer fall I walked through the outdoor area with mostly dead shrubbery and flowers But you could tell with the landscaping that it has to be beautiful in the right season They also have a lot of different events going on throughout the year like dinners in the botanical garden at night which sounds really romantic and cool and special rotating exhibits So go out and enjoy this unique place just don t think you can pick up some free flowers they probably frown on that 
1jTYX5EVJS9YtO_bOPEong CMU This is a solid contemporary neighborhood bistro I liked Avenue B for its frequently changing menu with up to date dishes that appeal to current palates fresh ingredients competent kitchen overall the food is pretty good competent front staff friendly hostess helpful wait staff comfortable ambiance pricing comparing to other restaurants of its type not too expensive Why it s not a 5 star While the kitchen does have the basics down they won t overcook the meat for example not every component of every dish works I do appreciate that they are at least trying to put together interesting flavors but sometimes the combination is just off Of what I ve sampled there I d rate the dishes in the B range they are far from a disaster but none was a hit out of the park winner Recently a friend walked into Salt of the Earth and confused it with Avenue B because of the oversized chalkboards I thought the two restaurants make an interesting comparison I d give the food nod to Salt but I probably would visit AveB more frequently because it is a more comfortable dining experience overall 
1Kofvw0PqiB4UblY-suE7A CMU I asked some local family members where to go to find cool old books and used books in general and I was directed here When we walked in it only took a few seconds to realize that the place was very well organized I took a moment to scan the store to see the sections before selecting a place to start It was not like one of those confusing old bookstores where everything is hit or miss We found old books in foreign languages mostly german and french with some latin spanish portugese and others The old books were really amazing They were reasonably priced Fairly priced Unlike some other bookstores that just push for profits They had some that were more valuable up in front and some glass cases that you could peruse without even asking for help to open the cabinets There were more unusual cultural studies academic type books and other sections that you might not always find And perhaps most unusual was that they had an incredible art section complete with architecture photography and even old music scores I found the medical selection a little lacking but no place is perfect though this place probably comes pretty close We were able to get a lot of great stuff and I will certainly try to come back to this place every time I am in town 
1lhxQlRBN9X2t512yWG5MA CMU I thought this was a pretty cool store but they don t have as much as other toy stores do Lots of educational non violent stuff for kids can be found here 
1LLHtWUjE4M6JjFdNxlokg CMU Average american style chinese food with fair prices and extremely quick preparation The location is a bit questionable as it is in a basement It is usually filled with college students but you will occassionally find an older individual working on a 40 while watching television Tawain Cafe s charm comes from the waiter bus boy who tries to make it a more personal experience 
1M-4dN-5jx1s0OuJavybVA CMU One day a man had a dream Probably not an inspiring I have a dream kind of dream but more likely a poorly understood collection of images viewed while unconscious and only vaguely remembered At any rate this man woke up one day from his slumber and said Hey I like Qdoba and Chipotle but instead of burritos could I customize rolls of extremely inauthentic sushi from limited options And make sure it s mostly rice BAM Sushi Fuku was born So pick a protein some add ons a sauce and a type of rice and throw it all together in a bowl or a roll yes it rhymes and yes you can t walk 2 feet in the place without being reminded of it It s not bad but once the limited novelty wears off that s about all you can say of the place It s sushi fast food and though I felt it was a little overpriced though admittedly each roll is quite large I ll probably wind up back here Especially if the line is longer at Chipotle 
1M4xhr1eok9N1Kf6oQl_0Q CMU A true French Brasserie experience I KU went there last evening for an impromptu dinner date We were warmly greeted in French at the door The owner himself is quite a character a true Frenchman of the North He s a tad boisterous but he made our experience overall a good one He gave great recommendations and also entertained the children that were sitting next to us with various magic trips The staff that he has hired is knowledgeable not only in French cuisines but in French as well We were served water along with slices of baguette and butter The baguette was good not great I ve had better La Gourmandine Paris of course For an appetizer we ordered warm tarts that were filled with brie and caramelized onions which melted in our mouth It was served alongside a mixed green salad with a tangy dressing that had a nice bite For our main entrees I ordered a very traditional Brasserie meal Poulet r ti et frites which also came with asparagus It was very simple but extremely delicious My KU ordered one of the night s specials leg of lamb that quite literally fell off the bone It was served alongside scalloped potatoes and asparagus We asked for a wine recommendation that went well with lamb and was served a delightfully light red The owner has put together a small but very delicious wine list We topped the night off with what else but Cr me br l e A wonderful truly authentic French Brasserie a must try 
1McP5CGQN2A8zJzMg8ec4Q CMU Hey super savers Food shots candy necklaces Cheap slim vundabar bar is not German b 
1MZOSz6xUFmb7mRBa8VhXw CMU What a fantastic breakfast Service is good and the food is outstanding Parking can be tricky but with a fun neighborhood like this who cares I ll go back here again ASAP 
1Oe3LBI2oeNcZkOUBetbgQ CMU Very expensive and small but organized and clean store but it s got all my fav foods so I come all the time to stock up my pantry Get the various ramen noodles steamed japanese cheese cake bento to go lots of green tea and they even have some great japanese shampoo and conditioner if you ever need them Right next to a laundry place parking is almost always available in that little plaza Come check it out 
1OICyYQWc0WBPDQ39Jrjyw CMU It s an entire enterprise centered on salads customized and created right in front of you And that s enough alliteration for one review The value proposition is VERY simple If you want a salad and you want to have a lot of control over what goes into it chosen from a variety of options then go here If you want anything else in the world don t go here they have other menu items but nothing that can t be beat elsewhere I will give a special mention of their beverage selection Pretty good unsweetened iced tea sits next to a fountain with multiple Boylan brand whoops sodas Better than your normal soft drink offerings Oh and because you have to basically go down the counter with someone as he or she makes your salad I think it would be a hard place to go with groups since there will be substantial lag in between the times the first and last people receive their salads though it s not as big a problem as it would be at other restaurants since you don t have to worry about your salad getting cold 
1oj8L38TXGSwJbuo34xpIw CMU I like thisSquill location better cuz they have sweet potato fries Still my 2nd fav cheesesteak place ever 1st place belongs to del amo steakhouse in torrance it s really really good with provolone and not the yellow slimy stuff I really miss this place Definitely tastes better when you eat it on the spot but even to go is still great 
1ONMy2dAzhT4otbWBpYTEQ CMU This is a beautiful botanical garden to visit for a few hours Admission is 12 There is plenty of parking out in front This is a review of visiting in the winter Some of the exhibits change themes with season For example the Serpentine room had snow snowmen and melted snowmen in a pond East room had a plants decorated in holiday lights Broderie room was decorated with poinsettias Trains wind the South Conservatory around the plants There are a lot of interesting plants to see in the Palm court Fern room Orchid room etc Some highlights were Tropical fruit and spice room with bananas coffee papayas Tropical Forest conservatory with waterfalls fish pond and ferns that shrivel up when you touch them Japanese courtyard garden outdoors featuring many bonzai s The outdoor gardens are limited in what you can see during the winter and pretty bare though also less crowded I would love to come back in the spring or summer Check out some of my pictures 
1PRm-eTnNMFInyYaYJDDjw CMU GREAT Reminds me of yogurt land or golden spoon in Cali I wish this appeared earlier since I no longer live here Finally some basic things coming to Pittsburgh its amazing The fruit is very fresh esp considering how hard it is to get fruit in this city you can see them cutting it all day long Other places thaw frozen fruit which is just nasty Only suggestions for razzy fresh is to cool it a couple degrees more because it thaws so fast and waiting in a line of yogurt shop naive Yinzers generally means my yogurt is melted before I buy it I love this place Good prices good yogurt 
1pvoyfecyGQZ-P6bIl7SPg CMU My favorite coffee shop on Walnut St Most of the folks in there are regulars who greet each ohter by name I did my job search there this winter so I was in daily and I too got to know everyone there The coffee is great the staff is friendly and they have free wireless One day I couldn t get the wireless to work and the guy who does their IT just happened to be in the shop and not only did he set my wireless up for me which he didn t have to do he also fixed my computer which he REALLY didn t have to do This place has a warm friendly welcoming environment and is a lot quieter that hte coffee tree It is my fave coffee shop The also serve ice cream and have outdoor seating which is perfect for summertime 
1QbZMh8JQF97nd-_Rw7l-g CMU Quality of food and the prices were good Our only complaint was that they ran out of seafood pancakes Silky Tofu was very good It s not very easy to find We would go back 
1QmLj-Z4IxTEWEEBhpunUA CMU I love it here and I try and introduce it to as many people as possible They have great lunch specials meal egg roll and soup and they aren t typically crowded so you can get in and out pretty quickly Both my parents aren t big fans of Chinese food and I think most people associate Thai food with Chinese Not the case There are some similarities but I love the flavors and sauces used in Thai and the vegetables always seem so much more fresh Needless to say my parents love it here now I always order the spicy chicken and opt for spicing of 5 scale of 1 to 10 I ve gone up on the scale to 7 and my eyes and nose were watering I love how flavorful the food is and you get an ample food for the price I ve ordered the spring rolls or the corn fritters as an appetizer and they are very tasty and the sauce that accompanies them is perfect although it is a sweet sauce The Pad Thai also gets goods reviews from friends I ve taken The place is clean and the service is attentive Stop by and give it a try if you re in the Shadyside area And on the bonus side it s right across the street from Mercurio s so you can swing by for some gelatto afterwards 
1qR6mwoWM8jmghBa3smysA CMU The chef really makes some challenging dishes The dishes incorporated seasonal local produce we had ramps All the menu choices are posted on the giant chalkboard and you get choices of sides The restuarant is small and seating area is very tight but acceptable If you are looking for a contemporary menu that incorporates all many types of cuisine look no further and bring a bottle of vino 
1qW6DcHV0bomtn9ypmv2Tg CMU Allegro Hearth sells my favorite bread in Pittsburgh Sadly I don t get over to Squirrel Hill as much as I d like add another reason to miss Right by Nature as they used to sell their products sigh I would highly recommend their deli and multi grain breads I find the loaves even freeze well when I unintentionally end up with TOO MUCH AWESOME BREAD for one week of sandwiches They make a pretty awesome croissant too for something lighter and flakier from their bakery case You definitely have to get past the quirks of the staff though It s not that their employees are inattentive because they are perfectly nice and helpful I just find them spacey or incomplete if that s a proper way to describe their service 
1rcmyDxhoCKftleR9Oe2YQ CMU I had previously had their cookies cream ice cream when a friend brought a pint over and I wasn t impressed It was pretty bland and freezer burned with only minuscule flecks of cookies In the store I tried a sample of the blood orange sorbet which was completely flavorless and I was getting ready to give up when I decided to try the cookie dough ice cream It was creamy with HUGE chunks of cookie dough exactly what ice cream should be The cone was good but not great As for the store and the staff a long line moved quickly and the store smells delicious due to the made in house cones I wouldn t go out of my way to go here again but it s definitely not bad if you re in the neighborhood 
1rfHd23NOcVYEivCgGlcuQ CMU In my sizable experience the worse a hole in the wall a BBQ Pit is the more finger lickingly delicious their food is T K s is no exception The decor atmosphere and service are not going to win any awards but the soul food is as good as it gets the prices are extremely reasonable it was 10 for my meal and they gave me a ton of ribs I got the pork ribs with 1 2 honey mustard sauce and 1 2 hot sauce and a side of mashed potatoes and greens The sides were savory rich and fresh and the ribs were some of the best I ve ever had I d go back in a heart beat but plan on getting the food and taking it to go for a summer picnic dinner 
1s0NtLIsRrdMJLwFw-H6xQ CMU The chef here won t ever be in the running for a Michelin Star or a James Beard Award but Orient Express has some extremely reliable strengths 1 The service is FAST Not necessarily stellar or friendly but fast They take your order and bring the food out extremely quickly 2 The food is cheap It s hard to feel ripped off especially given the amazing convenience 3 The experience is consistent They ll get you to your meeting class nap on time and the food is reliably just below average But sometimes that s just what hits the spot especially when it fits the schedule and budget as well If you re looking for a date night place fine dining or something absolutely unique or delicious look elsewhere But Orient Express certainly has its advantages 
1S57ifJbQ-rb2e1RwX_G5Q CMU The margaritas and chicken wings are great The place is really loud sometimes and the rest of food is just OK The corn bread used to be better but somewhere a long the way they changed it and its not as good nowadays 
1S7h6JvHk_0K2wJ9-7Sdmw CMU Primanti Bros is a unique and solid Pittsburgh delicacy Not only was my sandwich tasty the sandwich itself could have fed three of me Boyfriend had the pimanti cheesesteak which isn t actually a cheesesteak I had the salami sandwich but forgot to ask for cheese It was still good If I lived here I would take visitors here for a taste of local flavor but the sandwiches aren t exactly my dish it s too much food and not easily kept as left overs 
1sNEF-LX09PWf5AehiO09w CMU 4 stars for Pittsburgh Competent service good drinks I don t love the theme ed ness or for that matter the food But they have lots of great specials and the California salad with lime cilantro dressing is one of the best salads in the Burgh If you don t like the noise go for lunch especially a weekend lunch or early dinner Other locations are fine too FYI vegetarians the dressing has cheese in it And it s so good I bet it s actually real parmigiano reggiano too or close to it 
1sO7diOjjsNUJCUz_X7E2Q CMU absolutely loved this place it was the first time i d been to one and i will keep going back i sampled a couple and finally went with the oatmeal raisin flavor innovative flavors that are delicious and available in both ice cream and yogurt style and the prices are quite reasonable finally somewhere in pittsburgh to give the coldstone a run for their money 
1SoiIiKx1M7VGZ2JDzeH6A CMU I really wanted to give this a great review because I have very fond memories of this place when I was a kid with my mom and also when I was in my early 20 s hitting this place after 3 AM Alas I went there this morning and found out it really is just your typical greek diner with a giant menu I give it kudos for the jukebox on the tables Sopranos finale style and I thought our server was great She easily had been doing this for 40 years The atmosphere is good just like any other diner you would go too I was here this morning with my friend Fiona and we both needed a hearty breakfast to help with our recovery from the prior night The coffee was good and plentiful We never had less than half a cup I had two poached eggs and white toast The eggs were poached perfectly and the bread was appropriately soaked with butter All in all this was pretty good My bacon was also fine with three healthy strips However Fiona was less lucky She had a veggie omelette which was average at best size doesn t matter with respect to omelettes I d rather less eggs but super beaten so the omelette is light The veggies were plentiful but I d prefer the veggies lightly sauteed so texturely there isn t such a difference from the eggs to the vegetables The sausage was good but cold She asked for crispy bacon and it wasn t crispy at all in fact it was exactly the same doneness as mine The homefries were okay but I prefer a little more crust on the potatoes I d say this is a perfectly acceptable diner but I d recommend you ll enjoy your meal much better if it s at 2 AM in the morning as opposed to 10 AM on a saturday when most of your whits are about you and your palate is not dulled from the Tequila 
1S_4TY0rQsbp-9MZb88pRg CMU this place is so horrible and I can t believe the rice they sold is mixed with really bad one And they would never return it and exchange it 
1T7uBGauBzn1QJi6ymNFNw CMU Went on a Saturday with my gf She had pad thai and it was average nothing special I had beef w brown sauce w snow peas and shrooms The brown sauce tasted like dishwater with a hint of sesame Not sure why all the rave reviews here there has got to be better Thai in the burgh 
1tgJ09h-Oie2eObMfxEhoQ CMU This Starbucks is my particular favorite because it is extremely clean and cozy The people that work here are some of the nicest I ve ever met 
1uxWBKSOpuCAePO-qkpRhw CMU Despite the abundance of cafes in this neighborhood none are any good until now While I normally prefer beans from Intelly or CC the CommonPlace beans roasted in Indiana PA are quite good and the staff do a bang up job preparing coffee any number of ways In addition to the great coffee the staff are overly friendly though they take a bit of getting used to as one employee constantly greets me a male with What can I get for you Ma am A bit quirky The music is also great I like the morning guy s mix of old school country and indie rock Only negatives are the industrial atmosphere and the fact that every single person in there is on a laptop This makes me feel like a freak when I m the only person talking like my conversation is now for everyone s ears What s up w coffee shops where no one talks These studying freaks should just go to the library All in all a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and another example of the fine cafes flourishing in my hometown 
1vU-VN2xhh0RtSFodzEmlg CMU This is the problem with independent coffee shops they can get away with murder People talk their shit about Starbucks but they ve at least some structure and a higher level of customer service most not all It was raining on this particular day in Pittsburgh It was humid but I was still in the mood for a delicious mocha I yelped local coffee shops and came upon 61C Cafe It was a cute joint everything you d imagine an independent coffee shop to be Cute and quaint The barista however was incredibly rude I had greeted her myself and all she could muster up was yes I ignored it and ordered an Almond Mocha She quickly steamed up some milk on the counter not from the fridge mind you and POURED in the mocha and almond syrup into my cup What happened to all your pumps Talk about inconsistency I should have asked for two pumps each to really have messed her up I don t know how she did it but she made no eye contact with any of us throughout the whole transaction and we ordered 2 more drinks on top of the almond mocha What s wrong girl You need me to pet you I was so exhausted with this girl I couldn t even enjoy my beverage It only takes one person to really mess up the whole experience 61C Cafe have some standards and check up on your staff The beverage quality is abominable And BTW your cookies are awful too 
1WMzRZSTLCZdkmr0eibMPA CMU I m seriously confused at why people hate on this place so much Maybe the service food can be iffy at times but today it was great I hadn t been here in a really long time so I felt like I had to try the food again to write a proper review We got the best seat in the house according to the host That actually means the seat by the window so you can people watch Everything looks good on the menu so I opted for a little bit of everything I started with the cauliflower soup I didn t know what to expect but it came as pureed with a cheesy taste to it It was amazing I asked the server what was in it and she said it was cream cheese Mystery solved cream cheese makes everything better I also tried the beat salad I loved the fact that there was golden and red beets in it I just wish there were more although I always feel that way about beet salads at restaurants it seems The main course was the Walnut Crusted Salmon with Bread Pudding and Apple Buerre Blanc It was really tasty The salmon was cooked perfectly which meant not over cooked at all and the bread pudding apple buerre was really delish Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive and I really couldn t ask for a better meal I ve been won over and I d definitely go back and try ten things again 
1WrZiQXLK2vvM1obPty1aw CMU This is the weirdest school I have ever been to in my life The people sometimes talk to themselves in garbled nonsense in the computer clusters It is good comic relief from the heavy work loads I suppose The prof s are GREAT though But the people are bizarre 
1X0KmCLzYRFcJaKgSpMocg CMU Yes I know it s a huge chain Yes they only serve burritos But I had a friend in from out of town who d never eaten at a Chipotle because friends told him it was mediocre This is the best fast food restaurant I know Five stars I have never had food this fast cheap tasty in any form that was repeatable If you re not eating the vegetarian options the carnitas pork pinto beans is hands down the best combination 
1X2U8zgSijgmbal8NDRJSg CMU I came here for the pizza the other night as I ve heard other friends raving about it I was a bit skeptical that a gelato place could make good pizza but I was proven wrong I ordered the Pizza del Re which sounded absolutely splendid Truffle oil mushrooms fresh mozzarella and prosciutto di parma As I suspected it was pretty friggin amazing The prosciutto and the truffle oil made it stand out though It was such a wonderful medley of flavor The only reason I couldn t give this place 5 stars was the crust It got kind of soggy and reminded me more of a pita rather than pizza crust It was OK but definitely could be improved However I can t wait to try some of their other pizza options This definitely has become one of my favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh 
1XbUFlwbsPcSInKuF_LS1g CMU I grabbed a quick steak quesadilla for 6 on special and it was loaded with steak peppers and cheese It basically hit the spot It looks like they have a good beer selection and drink specials as well 
1xR74z3x37_dVGro_WIV3Q CMU Maybe it is for sentimental reasons that I need to give the Oakland location 5 stars but it it also because even though I have been coming here for 16 years God that is creepy I love it each and every time I have never had bad service here whether they are busy or not the bartenders and servers are always attentive and make sure your drinks are always full and replenished The dark ambiance creates a mystery about the place and I am not sure if I would want to see it all lit up after all of these years anyway It can be loud from time to time but seating is always quite intimate so you can hear whomever you are with Chips and salsa are yum fish or chicken tacos are always yum and of course the margaritas are always yum I yearn for the Apple Cider Margarita often because it is only seasonal The Gobblerito is a must have in November as well I will continue to patronize this location even though I am many years removed from my years in South Oakland Keep up the fab work 
1YG4-mEbU2PBL-Xca6Xf8Q CMU I was looking for a casual ish place to entertain business partners The parameters decent bar options food for picky eaters dieters as well as the slightly adventurous and not about the break the bank I walked away from a fairly decadent meal for about 30 a head including tip and tax Not bad Not bad at all Location great neighborhood for those who know it right by Pitt CMU and the Carnegie institute Street parking can be a bit of a pain And don t try finding the restaurant on your GPS it s technically in a park but it s visible from Forbes Street If you re doing an event here for folks out of town be sure to give good directions about travel and parking Appetizers I ordered plates of meat and vegetarian antipasti for the table with two cornbread skillets The food was appropriate for our table and there were small plates already out but why no serving utensils Also the cornbread skillet is somewhat awkwardly sized it s way too big buttery and dense for one person too large to be romantic for two probably more appropriate for four people to share but it feels small I don t know I would almost prefer it if they did single serve cornbread pieces that were a third the size of the cornbread dishes Entrees I was quite pleased with my scallops well seasoned kind of unexpected combination with roasted pumpkins I believe and my table mates seemed pleased with their pizza nice presentation on the pizza and their hamburgers and veggie burger Atmosphere mostly a young adult crowd kind of felt like a fresh twist on a diner Modern decor I found fitting great park views but the MUSIC Top 40 s dreck playing a bit too loudly for my taste If I m back in the area I ll definitely consider doing another meal here but as far as I m concerned this is not a place I ll go out of my way to visit again 
1YqBkFTtGPC8D-1mehjD-Q CMU on a short vacation here i went to the museum and it was good there was an exhibit on the First Ladies which had a lot of cool stuff like clothing and White House China the Heinz history part of the museum was pretty bad ass as was the glass making part thumbs up 
1yqUIq6eQekQWmQjxVjmAQ CMU Terrible preparation was sloppy taste was mediocre Sushi rolls fell apart 
1YY8lUPhsGX9ws1lmjcgPg CMU These hotcakes crepe pancakes are to die for I just had the blueberry hotcakes this morning and I almost creamed my pants I obviously couldn t finish the whole thing or else I d be in a food coma or turn diabetic from the rich brown sugar embedded between the layers or cream butter and magic but it was one of the best breakfast pancakes crepe variations I ve ever had This is actually quite a big deal to me because I ve had classic Paris crepes with Nutella and this is up there on the omg you have to try it scale The quirky diner scene with checkered tables was a nice addition and the staff is rather friendly Apparently this place is crowded for brunch on weekends but going on an overcast Tuesday morning at 9 seemed to work out well Anyway if you re in Pittsburgh you must try this place For Shame if you have not 
1Z-mLi9s_fnpwCjLPe4Eew CMU It was a warm early summer night and Annie surprised me with reservations for this charming little bistro that I have been meaning to visit since it s opening but for whatever reason just kept missing the opportunity However after chatting with the chef at the restaurant party I d renewed my urgency for visiting The restaurant is located on s braddock ave in regent square I used to spend more time here back when a friend lived near and its added a few good spots since D s six pags and dogz for example but I ll save that review for another time This is a nice area for date night with a few places for casual fine dining independant flick at Regent square theater or shopping then pool and guiness at one of the local irish pubs Legume offers outdoor dining which is great especially when their is good people watching like there is here We weren t able to sit outside but got a fine table in the intimate and dimly lit dining room It is a small place and unfortunately we were seated a little too close to some guy going on and on about hedge funds so it was a little too close for comfort I think there is like 8 or 10 tables mostly 4 tops The floors are hardwood and I like some of the details of the space itself such as the fixtures and art These folks also get the details as I noticed with the silverware they were using I think Toast uses the same type of simple ornate silverware A couple other non food details It s byob for a small corkage fee of 3 Many other spots charge 10 You can feel comfy in Jeans flip flops or a suit and I noticed all forms of attire and all ages These folks are totally ingredient driven and I m sure are into the whole farm to table movement and sustainability They change most of the menu daily and use top quality ingredients and often serve traditional fare with a contemporary flair Okay onto the food We started with some good quality crusty bread and delicious room temperature high quality butter Our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive I started with the tuna tartar It was a nice portion of sushi grade tuna with perhaps a citrus or some type of acid used to cut the richness of the fish It was okay I mean it didn t blow me away but was perfectly acceptable However I have to admit I ve had tuna tartare that seemed to have a more crisp or bright flavor if you will at other places Again it was fine just not 5 stars Annie tried the Buttermilk soup with bulger chickpeas and parsley Unfortunately Annie didn t know it was served cold and that would have been a non starter for her before go I tasted it and not really being a fan of cold soup it wasn t my thing either I get what he was going for I think It was rich while also not seeming to be too heavy It had a very layered flavor and I noticed many different spices most notably curry I had the steak for my entree and I think it was served with mashed potatoes It was cooked perfectly delicious and flavorful The mashed potatoes were also really good I don t think I want to know how much cream and butter is used For me the steak was the first thing I had that I really liked here Annie had their famous Chicken cooked under a skillet with garlic and mashed potatoes I really enjoyed this also and see why it is so popular The chicken was moist and I prefer this than to just boring chicken breast The skin was great and the mashed potatoes again were quite good We skipped dessert however I think next time we ll definitely try them One last thing the waitress noticed Annie didn t eat her soup and insisted on taking it off the bill This place is quite good and probably deserves 3 5 stars I hope to do a better job on my choices next time and update this review with another star 
1ZitAVPeXrdNrKuQYdOTbg CMU I live off this stuff I m a strong advocate of fast and cheap service and even more so when their portions are huge You obviously can t expect iron chef quality food that you can eat for 2 meals for 5 so take it for what it is and enjoy it 
1ZY_qfVfS9YA_lEfzKXxwg CMU Was obsessed with this place when it first opened in Squirrel Hill and was happy that there was finally something new to try around Murray The food is consistently good but the service is dodgy at times First time we went we got the best service from a really personable waitress who was Peruvian herself Another time we waited forever to get a table while being put on three different lists by three different waitresses hostesses Love the fact that they re BYOB Our favorites are the Ceviche Causa de Langostinos Sudado Paella and Seco de Cerdo One gripe is that since the menu is so limited and unchanging after a few times there isn t a reason to go back anymore since there s nothing new to try 
1_TNLqCAB5YZvtUDRiTddw CMU I went here expecting the worst and was pleasantly surprised the place is funky Expect huge portions of cheap fairly good although on the greasy side food Bring your apetite The calzone is big enough to feed four for dinner easily Salad was okay and the salmon sandwich was better than expected but not great Next time I crave some hearty food I ll probably come back and get a pizza or calzone 
1_xhaRpr3IiQ61lCZ0LCDQ CMU I do agree with some reviewers that Dozen can be a hit or miss Certain days the cupcakes can be very dry and other days they are pretty good I do recommend the Elvis cupcake This is a nice peanut butter icing on top of a banana bread cupcake This particular one is awesome The flavors are right and neither the icing or the cake are too sweet They are just right I ve had the Salted Caramel one before but it turned out really sweet A bit too sweet for my taste but it is a nice contrast with the salty and sweet flavors The staff are always very nice and sweet I do like the convenience factor of it being so close to CMU I found it last minute it was a coworkers birthday so I immediately hopped over to Dozen to grab a few cupcakes to celebrate her birthday I wish there was an ability for them to bake at this location but since the store is so small there really isn t enough room to do all the baking in house All the goods come from their Lawrenceville location 
2-30OJbNLopNQrODIJQb1A CMU Their food is good and they have plenty of healthy options including an option for a veggie as your side instead of their delicious chips I work in Oakland so it s a good place to stop by and get lunch from with reasonable prices I definitely couldn t afford to eat here every day of the week 
20fLZWDXTMmwvYP-wjjMdQ CMU Came here for a late dinner this weekend No wait for a table group of 6 Atmosphere is casual and soft Service at Thai Place is mehh at best We had a relatively long wait for food despite being the only group Then they neglected to put in one of our orders for fried calimari It also took a couple times asking before we got ice for the water The food was good though nothing especial I had the panang chicken which came out pretty well Others in my group had the fried rice which was eagerly devoured as well as the fried calimari However many of the calimari pieces were batter only no calimari inside How on earth does that happen Lastly though the tom yum soup drew rave reviews Although the atmosphere was nice and the staff courteous the long wait time combined with just ok food makes me believe that there are easily better options for thai asian food in Pittsburgh 
20PwJm9HuAbgnpy_-dHsug CMU On my first visit here I spoke with the very knowledgeable assistant and gave her free reign to design an arrangement based on the freshness and uniqueness of the flowers at that time my budget and the occasion Since then unless I need something specific like roses I m more than comfortable with trusting their decisions in crafting a special arrangement The prices are right and they usually have good seasonal specials 
218VdhvgVVspuxhJ6ZOVvQ CMU If you wanna see local color come to D Amicos If you wanna get a stiff drink in the middle of the afternoon while walking around with a bandage on your face and wanna fly under the radar true story come to D Amico s This place is absolutely no bells or whistles the waitresses are loud and the stale sent of grease and old liquor hangs in the air All the way down to the cracked teal vinyl seats this place is legit D Amico s just don t give a s t But it s all good Having traveled quite a bit I often find placees like this refreshing The Wedding Soup is comforting and they are generous with the bread And they have no judgements about the previously mentioned strong drink that I consumed at 2 37pm on a Friday afternoon 
21XmdqeNQzSTbjUsI_ftKQ CMU Avalon Exchange consistently has a good selection of used clothing it s a bit more expensive than goodwill or the salvation army but you re stuck looking for needles in the hay stack so to speak they ve done that work for you they also buy clothes on the spot and while they re picky about what they take it s still a pretty easy way to make 20 or you can take store credit instead of cash which will give you a better return overall it s definitely worth checking out 
22BXJTOJOxQ0wxY4Zspm3w CMU Great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking you ve been doing Many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries and only a few nights in the parking lot hanging onto the light pole for dear life while hurling up that last stoli v and ginger A great place to be drunk in not so great to be hung over in They have your typical greasy spoon fare so don t go if you re concerned about your health Otherwise eat on brave soul eat on 
22eYiPp_FlojMIfWb9ZbVA CMU Ok pizza However good luck if u have any interaction with the bartender She was the most inhumane person on 7 16 2010 7 17 2010 The owner isnt much better Only support this place if you absolutely must eat after drinking in shadyside 
22vmBrJhzkmYRN2BhCtZDw CMU the food just keeps getting worse and the other day there was a three hour wait never going back 
23mMqWbOs1ayDhOIqrGHkA CMU Great food at relatively cheap prices Their steak hoagie is great I can t tell you about anything else because that is all I get 
24Qtf6XDwwZUMvQvnw65NQ CMU I don t usually like chains but I m so happy that this Panera exists It s a great location and it s nice to have somewhere to escape from the rain or cold hey it s Pittsburgh the weather sucks I like Dozen Cupcakes better for the cuteness but Panera is more convenient for using wifi and escaping from people I ve come here with friends too though As far as I know the food is the same at every Panera which can be a good thing It sure beats McDonald s when I m somewhere unfamiliar 
26jzh7o4_D5ifUIPwqn_-g CMU I have trouble ordering tea when I m out because it s such a simple thing to make I know there are a lot of nuances to the preparation like everything else that can give you a plethora of subtle variation that you wouldn t get if it was made incorrectly However I still can t stand paying for it However Te Cafe has a great selection of gourmet teas that make the stop worth it It s the kind of stuff that unless you were a tea connoisseur you would never be tasting Their menu is full of teas all with names that vary from mundane to Japanese to just plain odd I ve been to the Te Cafe a few times but last night I ordered the Kokeicha It s a kind of smokey green tea that you steep for 3 minutes I tried to order a tea by the name of gunpowder but they were sadly out of it The man behind the counter informed me that the Kokeicha was very similar The tea was great and honestly even when something s not your cup of tea you have a fun experience It s something you usually don t get to try on your own Who would honestly buy 23 dollars worth of loose leaf tea that they ve never tried I ll leave it to the Te Cafe to let me sample them a pot at a time Every time I enter the cafe the staff are friendly accommodating and most of all informative They know their way around tea so someone who is completely ignorant as I am can get a little guidance It s a fun place to relax and enjoy a beverage you usually wouldn t how often do you drink gunpowder at home 
270tvHqDekoAGb4NdBt7tA CMU came here for a lunch buffet and i am a huge fan of indian food Friend took me to one in squirrel hill and it was delicious but this was not the case here at tamarind I live right down the street at the king edward and was hoping this place would be a gem Okay i tried i really really TRIED to like this place but when your chicken tikka masala is the ONLY dish i d consider borderline acceptable during a lunch buffet that s a problem c mon its chicken tikka masala make the chicken tender and the sauce takes care of itself this felt like chewing rubber with a side of gravel the one star is there for the excellent service who was also nice enough to leave his name Martin standup fellow and number i wouldn t be so cruel on a napkin for our friend because she was cute as hell 
27BT0hg1CYEZp3XDutpDRQ CMU Dozen is reopening This is such an exciting thing for me I hace always loved dozen ever since I lived in Lawrencville Cupcakes and coffee from dozen were my special treat to myself Everyone was always so friendly and all of their sweets fantastic I will be adding my thoughts on the new ownership once they have opened their doors once more I m hoping they won t be a let down I m not thinking they will be p 
27e_3oc5Bn-yOWOcLqLAfg CMU The best crepes I ve ever had I have tried to find something that compares but I can t and I don t know if I will It can get pretty busy in here and often there can be a line but it is worth the wait Just as a note When you go in you should order first and then find a table It often can be busy enough that all the tables are full at the moment you walk in You should wait your turn and order at the counter Once you have placed your order take a seat They will probably not let you order until an open table has popped up Thus if it is busy don t be a jerk whether you meant it or not by grabbing a table as soon as you see it open up if you are waiting in line Also if I remember correctly it is cash only 
27nDPIrnPegLCM26MkOqJg CMU Place was great Had the tandoori shrimp and although few was great ilas I dipped in my friends gourmet sauce she ordered the kofta veggie I d definitely recommend to others and go back sooner than later Also the service was good started off slow but got great in the end 
27_OzmJiutcaybvJstyycg CMU Great place Apparently it s the go to place for many depressed grad students during the long dark cold Pittsburgh winters Stop by during the Christmas festivities for bonus entertainment like caroling and handbell performances It s a great place for kids I was a former Discovery Cart volunteer before being swamped with other time commitments They typically have a few craft stations set up around the conservatory Some days during the summer kids even get to pot a plant to take home The only con is that part of the outdoor garden is closed for weddings most weekends but you probably aren t missing out on much And one tiny personal opinion I d love for them to feature some native Western Pennsylvania plants I realize that the typical visitor probably only wants to see exotic plants though 
28DQLxRTLTpgLkbV5cqafw CMU I was excited to see a Filipino restaurant in Squirrel Hill but the food was only okay to me Still the option of eating Filipino food here is great 
28hWKzmUh5AReXaOPkageg CMU Half price after 11PM which is a good reason to go for college students I went here pretty often Things to try for sure are the blue cornbread and any of the burritos The quesadillas and nachos aren t bad either 
28JcAkf9UFj-1uPkynvnIA CMU Doc s Place offers cheap bar food in a chill atmosphere The biggest perk Doc s has to offer is their price There is always a special on something on the menu every single day from half priced burgers to half priced pizzas Their pizza s are huge but not particularly tasty Their burgers are definitely bargains at half price but nothing spectacular either I like my burgers rare medium rare the last one I had at Doc s seemed to have a darker color than a typical burger I wasn t sure if it was because the meat was frozen or just not fresh I didn t get sick so there were no issues Anyways Doc s Place is a nice place to hang out in the spring and fall as the outdoor balcony is quiet and peaceful the food just isn t anything noteworthy 
29cyhIDiIMCZY-NewHfgDg CMU This is one of my go to lunch spots in Shadyside The food and service is consistent and they have a great beer selection This is a great place to come and watch a game You can usually find a seat even when everywhere else is packed because it is not the typical sports bar It is also a good spot to grab bite late night I came here today and ordered the Tijuana Tuna this is the only place I will order a tuna sandwich from and it comes with hot peppers that add a bit of kick to the traditional tuna as well as a sweet honey sauce that compliments the spiciness perfectly The honey sauce also goes great with the chips Today I tried a bite of the Chicken and Spinach Panini as well and it was equally as appealing it will probably be what I order next time 
29eJpZguaC-w05qORamSPA CMU Contrary to a lot of the other reviews posted I think Ginza is getting sort of a bad rep because lots of people are ordering from their Japanese side of the menu when they really should have a closer look at the Korean stuff The restaurant s owner is Korean She s a fascinating woman she s a cook of all trades but her born and bred sense of hometown Korean cooking is evident in the Korean food we got It s a family business and it s at the very least friendly and talkative on a slow day My favorite dish of the day was the Dolsot Bibimbap Although it wasn t quite as crisp as other Dolsot Bibimbaps I ve had before the vegetables were still fresh and offered good contrast to the piping hot rice My own order the Jiajang Myun wasn t as spectacular In fact I d probably proffer that it was sort of on the runny side with strong traces of the fat still in it It was alright but probably something I wouldn t get a second time Overall I think I will look forward to trying this place again but this time I ll steer clear of the Japanese selections and shoot for the heartier Korean dishes 
29m05-zEoI_aJe5nD1xHqg CMU You can t tell the difference between food here and food in Japan bottom line An authentic Pittsburgh Best Eatery 
29OuJbiUM-xYpGxFr4PI4A CMU Even when it is 17 degrees outside I ll make it out to Dave Andy s if I want some ice cream Solid No I am not talking about the treat but the taste I tend to always go for the cookies and cream or birthday cake in a waffle cone I know kind of boring in that I always tend to get the same thing but the ice cream is consistent 
2A8rk3OHnOT6IIqmZGcFpA CMU I insisted my whole life up until the day I got engaged that I would never get married My wife felt exactly the same so there we were a couple of people who had no idea what we were doing trying to figure out all the details of a wedding Neither of us knew anything about jewelry and we had decided to elope so we were pretty much on our own to figure it out It was intimidating to say the least and with the added fear that we might encounter some homophobia in the ring shopping process I dreaded it Antiques of Shadyside was the very first jewelry store we walked into simply picked for the fact that there was an adorable neon diamond out front and the one thing we did know was that we wanted antique rings The owners a married couple were both there and instantly put us at ease Both were helpful in educating us on all the decisions we had to make about what we each wanted in a ring and showed us numerous rings behind the glass case and pulled out boxes of more from the back They didn t bat an eye at a couple of ladies marrying each other Quite the opposite they were very welcoming and treated us like friends pulling out photos of their adorable grandson to share with us We must have been there over an hour and in that time my wife fell in love with a ring We left the store without it thinking it was ridiculous to buy a ring at the first place we walked into but only drove down the street before realizing it was just right and turning back We then spent months looking for my ring in over a dozen other stores in different cities Once I had a better idea what I wanted we came back to Antiques of Shadyside and they pulled out even more boxes of rings from the back until I found my ring Of all the stores we visited nobody was anywhere near as kind and helpful and nobody had as good a selection of antiques or such fair prices And in all the time we spent there we never once felt pressured to buy I probably couldn t recommend anyone more highly 
2B6-SMBXdB0ueHnjB6tITA CMU As mexican as it gets around here had an awesome experience eating off a sidewalk taco cart and squatting on someone s front steps in the middle of the night options pork chicken and beef And a full condiment bar real corn tortillas Delicious and at 2 a taco as good as it gets 
2BeRC_FXt2pcojlu_g22dA CMU Good coffee shop with high ceilings and an open front on to the street The Americano I had was very well brewed though the girl behind the counter appeared to be on autopilot never making eye contact and had the automatic cadence of an autoworker on an assembly line The art work was well framed and neatly displayed as was the various mugs cups and coffee presses etc The whole place was very clean and open The music was the proper volume for background sound without disrupting studying conversation or your own thoughts 
2bopRyI1clRa3UHxsBzaAQ CMU The best brunch in Pittsburgh After Doing brunch at about five other places this place really stands out The French toast was perfectly done with nutella and fruit The scramble was perfectly done as well with the right level of moisture and a hint but not overwhelming amount of goat cheese with a perfectly done potato pancake The dinner is pretty good too with a solid black bean burger and a memorable fish taco being on the offerings on that menu Prompt and attentive but not pushy wait staff round out this review One of my favorite restaurants in the burgh 
2BsostZqByVDSW-NyKPKEw CMU I m definitely a fan of Taza 21 My mom and I had lunch there a couple of weeks ago and we have been trying to go back ever since We both had wraps and they were great Make sure you try the cucumber sauce it s delicious 
2BV51t1yV47Ezeujkb2YYA CMU So I honestly can t believe a place so shabby is located on Walnut Street The place was cheap looking the frozen yogurt didn t taste very good It was obviously cheap They also only had 4 or 6 available flavors on the wall The rest you have to ask for which defeats the purpose The toppings bar lacked anything fun or fresh and I wasn t impressed with just a Hershey s chocolate syrup bottle to choose from I won t go back here and I don t recommend anyone else to 
2CANXDuE2uSFJvEhqqQRAQ CMU After a disappointing previous experience with BBQ in the city I was hoping that Yinzburgh could redeem the city s BBQ scene Upon finding out the owners were from Georgia I thought to myself these guys gotta know what reall BBQ is Turns out they do My first time at YB I tried the pulled pork with a side of cole slaw and macaroni and cheese I m picky about all three of those things so it was a leap of faith to get them all and have high expectations I was very happy with everything I ordered The pork was tender and full of flavor even without the BBQ sauce The cole slaw was creamy and had the right amount of tanginess The mac n cheese actually tastes homemade and is creamy with a lot of cheddar cheese Score My second trip to YB I tried the brisket Oh Em Gee This brisket is perfect Fork tender with a perfectly charred outer crust and tell tale smoke ring Take that hipster BBQ joint on N Highland Maybe you can learn something from these guys YB has 3 homemade sauces to cover the BBQ geography of your St Louis style red BBQ sauce Carolina Style vinegar sauce and a mustard based sauce It s hard to chose a favorite because they are all good on any of the meats The smoked wings are a must try as well 
2Ct7BnpEpPUqsJj6J7mxUQ CMU For a quick decent Chinese place in Shadyside check out China Palace You get what you expect it s fast and not too expensive I ve only had delivery but when I want Chinese food I ve never had any surprises At the end of the day you get what you pay for As for delivery in they area it s decent enough 
2cwRM5zuleOQ2t80etEbgg CMU Kohli s is an Indian import and convenient shop They sell a wide variety of things in a quite small space Being a convenient shop they have an impressive amount of drinks and candies The import part includes a wide variety of items including but not limited to housewares cookwares representations of deities spices frozen foods etc They also have a limited amount of fresh groceries I always encounter the same 3 people working there and they are all very friendly The impressive part for me at least is the take away tali type meals They sell scrumptious samosas for 90 and meals for less than 5 along with a few other hot items that seem to rotate in and out The hot food comes from the Indian restaurant Namaste and each lunch portion includes two entrees rice and half a naan There will be one with 2 veg options and one with 1 veg option and a chicken dish The thing I really love about the food is that it has some spice to it almost to medium which is better than no spice as some places do with any food prepared for the general public Please note that the lunch portion size is not terribly big so if you eat a lot you might want to get that samosa to round things out Also the lunches sometimes run out fast especially during the school year so get there earlier than later if you are counting on it the earliest I ve seen them sell out is by 1230 but usually it is after 1 This isn t the most charismatic Indian meal you ll ever get but I can tell you after working in this neighborhood for nearly 2 years it is a tasty and cheap option for lunch 
2DaTc5JIqfCxl8aMfg-_vA CMU Went there to celebrate with some friends and I was excited to try some Mexican food something I d been missing since I moved from San Diego to Pittsburgh Since there was a long wait we got margaritas and waited for the tables I got a strawberry margarita but the flavor was unnecessary as all I could taste was cheap nasty tequila Gross To mitigate the taste and try not to be sloshed before dinner we asked for some chips and salsa while we waited When we finally got some 15 minutes later I was buzzed and disappointed The chips and salsa were worse than even the store brand from the supermarket My opinion if a Mexican food restaurant can t do the good chips and salsa and margaritas I don t even want to try anything else We paid our tab and left before our table was even ready No thank you 
2DbecSJbF1Wu5A1Ukn_r-Q CMU These are the best casual food burgers I ve had but I had fast food written there first which would definitely be wrong I get a little annoyed at them taking 15 minutes to make a burger in a place that has a less charming interior than McDonalds The long wait time is the only thing that stops me from going here more than twice a year or so It s hard to find a clean table here as well Fries are very good but annoyingly large portions 
2DFvc5Z6W3rcJXQPYoJrEQ CMU Authentic food cozy environment recommendations are 61 73 service is little bit slow you usually wait for 20mins to get your dishes 
2DlY0F-6n7tC4j2kVBZOYA CMU Beautiful I went to see a friend sing in the holiday performance of the Renaissance City Choir which was whimsical and touching The acoustics are great and it s a gorgeous building We had no trouble finding parking on the street At this particular event there were cash only bars and refreshments stands and the closest ATM is two blocks away Might want to remedy that Over all though Check it out 
2DT4kEpCetSNYMsL8-41ng CMU Every time I come back to Pittsburgh for a visit and am in Oakland I make a stop at Dave Andy s In my mind it is totally worth it just for the homemade waffle cone with the surprise in the end 
2eMRefqUFXjUU3vGMLb3mA CMU The cashier didn t seem all to thrilled to serve me my ice cream and for that I have to take away too stars It s Baskin Robbins if you ve had ice cream at one then you ve had ice cream at all of them I think next time I ll just eat the Ben and Jerrys I have in my freezer 
2ER58QLF77JMDxdsuWq0XA CMU This place is pretty small I wouldn t expect to go in there and try on something in front of a mirror so that the tailor can check it out This is the kind of place you go only for dry cleaning items or if you know exactly what you need altered on a piece of clothing That being said I feel they did a good job with my belongings I had them let out the sleeves as much as possible on an old winter coat and I was pleased with the results however I get the impression they re pretty straight forward and stick to what you asked for what I mean is there may not be much finesse to their work but it s good work I can t remember what I used to pay for dry cleaning in Michigan but while the prices seemed reasonable somewhere deep down I thought they could be cheaper I would use them again though primarily for cleaning I might hesitate on more detailed tailoring requests 
2f23I5n8ZDk86NzVgCHdAg CMU Great staff huge tea selection as well as the best lemonades and hot chocolates in the city The tea selection is extremely extensive and the staff is very knowledgable and willing to help you out if you don t know what you want This is the kind of place where you can sit at the bar and chat with the baristas and there will be a regular sitting next to you reading the paper and ordering the usual While the tea menu is huge if you get the teas of the day listed on the board which are color coded by type black green white or herbal you ll get them for a lot cheaper I recommend hanging out for a while with a pot of a tea of the day which is only 3 for the pot with 2 hot water refills I also highly recommend their grilled cheese paninis with tomato which are overpriced but too good to pass up if you re hungry The hot chocolates are great specialty drinks in the winter better than any coffee shop I know and their specialty lemonades rock in the summer I ve known a handful of the baristas who worked here and all were happy and had fun befriending customers during their shifts which gives this place one of my favorite cafe atmospheres 
2g84hN-IL5Mni8X8Gi3epQ CMU Consistently tasty The waffles here are unlike any waffles I ve had before I have visited this place upwards of ten times in the past year and I enjoy the consistently tasty selection The ice cream is amazing and it s nice to have a fresh fruit option I highly recommend this place as a morning date though it may also be good as a late night snack Try the speculoos 
2G9JmzXj4jxArN_pJEuyng CMU This is the only restaurant in central Oakland that is both tasty and reasonably healthy Plus they make a big deal of using sustainably locally grown foods whenever possible I have to disagree with one of the reviewers disdain for the soup the spicy gumbo is pretty good though I always end up having to add extra hot sauce My personal favorite things about Red Oak include 1 Newly expanded hours 7 AM 9 PM so I can usually get food when I m hungry 2 Blue plate special is a really good deal My favorite one is jambalaya but the pulled pork and the fish are also good 3 Vegetarian blue plate option beans veg grain usually not terribly exciting but definitely healthy and tasty in an unassertive way 4 You can get vegetables as a side dish instead of chips 5 Oatmeal smoothie should be absolutely disgusting by any standard of reckoning but it is actually really delicious and can be a meal substitute in a pinch if you re running really late and have to drink your breakfast out of a straw while you run to class 6 All the sandwiches and salads are really tasty and you can get a salad made into a wrap if you want The things that kind of annoy me about Red Oak 1 It gets really crowded over lunchtime and if the short middle aged woman who works there thinks you ve taken long enough to eat your meal she will tell you so Best times to go are before or after the big lunchtime rush 2 It s a bit more expensive than the other lunch restaurants in that part of town but totally worth it especially when you consider that the food is fresh and good for you unlike the other restaurants in Oakland 
2gFDzKuTgQy-6V5XzJOExw CMU Pretty good little indian spot Cool dining room old house turned into restaurant Service was not bad a little difficult to understand at times tho Food was generally good I ve only had indian a few times so it s hard for me to compare but here s what I could gather I had the chicken vindaloo the sauce was very good very spicy I like spicy but the chicken was dry and the potatoes tasted odd they were either pre made frozen or deepfried and then became soggy I m not sure My gf has the tikka masala which was about on the same level Dry chicken undercooked peppers good sauce tho The Channa Batura on the other hand was exceptionally good Comes with a chickpea curry which tasted damn near perfect Came same time as the rest of the food for some reason but could not recommend this dish more There s a good chance we ll return for more 
2GgfkmDhvVxvglvCZs1A9A CMU You would not think this was going to be a good time Toast is strategically located between the Hillman Cancer Center and Cricket s strip club overlooking the bus highway Parking is on the street The building itself is nondescript Walk in Inside it is warm dark and VERY COZY The crowd is laid back and friendly The menu is sophisticated yet not fussy The restaurant has confidence We went there once with reservations and the manager immediately said I have a seat upstairs but no one is up there I m guessing you want to be downstairs Let me buy you a glass of wine and we ll get you seated when the next table comes up here That s the kind of smart service you want Loved it Overall Very sexy Bring your spouse Bring a date Bring both They ll thank you for it 
2gGKP0YOg4yrldW_owkaZg CMU Dude get the morning after breakfast my friend says What is it he says Don t worry trust me Most of the time this scenerio has a bad ending but this time I am glad I took my stoner friend s advice The morning after breakfast is their banana chocolate chip pancakes with bacon egg and sausage It was so so so so good If you re coming to visit Pittsburgh you have to go to Pamelas My only gripe about it is that for a breakfast place they open late 7 30am 
2gwZQqDgVa77r44brevQxA CMU I was told that we absolutely had to check this place out as it s apparently a famous local chain dating back to the coal mining days We went there for lunch at a fairly busy time so waiting for service took a little while I was a little confused as to whether we were supposed to order up or just seat ourselves but it was apparently the latter Do make sure you catch someone s eye when you re going there for lunch as they have an upstairs and a downstairs to serve and as far as i can tell barely a handful of people at work It s probably a good thing we went there hungry Each item on the menu is already more than filling including the so called sides They definitely deliver on their promise that every sandwich ordered is piled high with fries cole slaw and tomatoes unless you ask otherwise The meat might be a little hard to find beneath all these but not to worry it s there and you can still taste it Their streetman fries are a heart attack in a basket fries with chili cheese bacon and sour cream Don t order it as a side unless there s quite a few in your party It really is a meal to itself and more It s definitely worth at least one visit 
2hqpc3ztTxMR-pgrHOC4uA CMU I had heard a lot about Toast from a friend and was excited to try it Unfortunately I was underwhelmed I ordered fish over a bed of rice and the rice was very dry not Basmati try but dry to the point of being hard and undercooked The rest of my food was average but I think there are better restaurants in Pittsburgh at this price range Where Toast shines is as a wine bar The wine list is excellent and the atmosphere is intimate Parties are seated close together and if I were to give Toast another try it would likely be on a date 
2IpBhwrV-lXCebTlLKd-VQ CMU The food is good but the service and atmosphere is terrible I have been to this place a few times and it s always slow and there s not usually a table available to sit down at They sell a variety of six packs and 40s to go but beware Boone s Farm is quite literally the top shelf The staff is very rude on my last visit they messed up my order and gave me general tso s chicken instead of tofu The counter lady was pretty mean to me when I asked for it to be remade She then proceeded to give what should have been my meal to another guy who DID order chicken after me but who didn t want to take it because I had ordered extra spicy and he didn t want spicy food The cashier laughed at him argued with him that even medium would be too hot for him and in the end got him take my messed up order reluctantly She then proceeded to help five more people before she had the chef make the tofu that I ordered Like I said the food is good but I wouldn t go back to this place There are too many other Asian restaurants in Oakland where they don t make it difficult to get what you ordered 
2J0uVklyvKCmZIqt1mKC0A CMU You KNOW a grocery store is overpriced when they charge more than Whole Foods aka Whole Paycheck does for comparable items It gets two stars because I have no complaints about customer service or location And because I hate giving one star reviews 
2j68598aW38AsusySWzbEQ CMU Orgasm for the mouth soft and sweet but not too sweet I had the nutella banana waffle and adored it My friend had the strawberres and cream and liked hers as well My waffle was not cooked all the way in the middle and I didn even blink an eye I just kept swooping that delicious forkful of belgian inspired wonder right onto my tongue Coffee is priced fairly cheap just drip coffee buts ok in a pinch for coffee I love lattes and cappucinos so I would love if they had this option on their menu but that would make it more of a patisserie than a waffle shop All in all fun little stop great snack to warm you up from your shopping trips down murray ave I don t know how it compares to Oh yeah s over in shadyside but after comparing yelp reviews I chose it over the 3rd waffle shop which is close to Oh yeahs name escapes me The only gripe I have with some of the shadyside eats and treats places including Oh yeah s are the hours catering to nightlifers That may be good for business but you re missing business from us thirty somethings who graduated kindergarten and love to enjoy brunch at brunch time sunday morning to afternoon 
2JF5iM4BmXQ_t0P9pwFVkQ CMU I ve only visited the Murrysville location and there is no way it even comes close to In N Out Burger The food is extremely greasy so much so that it drips off the burger as you eat it The fries are greasy too and not at all crispy The free toppings were gross bacon full of fat soggy mushrooms must be all the grease Worst of all the prices are not reasonable I m not sure why other reviewers are even comparing the two In N Out is more fast food Five Guys seems more restaurant style no drive through etc Anyway there must be a better option for burgers and fries 
2jFWsI8TQpStrgERwk4V6w CMU this gym is terrible don t let the new equipment fool you there are only a handful of people who come here who have any clue what they are doing The staff knows very little and is way to present as in milling around doing nothing However they are in no way the biggest problem the problem is the patrons I ve never ever had to deal with a ruder group of people in my life and i lived in NYC for christ sake I ve seen this rudeness manifest into confrontation injury and all in all unsafe practices I ve been a member for 2 years and cannot wait until a better option opens don t join here unless you enjoy being frustrated on a daily basis 
2jmAcp16H78Cg7AWx-t0HA CMU I work from home full time and typically head to Arefa s on Fridays to work with one of my good friends During the day Arefa s is the perfect place to post up with your laptop drink incredible coffee and enjoy the house music The owner and her husband are both extremely friendly people who make a concerted effort chat with their customers Ask for the siphon coffee you won t be disappointed 
2JQ1cDosm6m9AOoemg-9Sw CMU I came here on a Friday night around 9 pm with my boyfriend and my parents who were staying at a nearby B and B We wanted to go somewhere both casual and inexpensive and La Feria definitely is both of those things We almost didn t find it it s upstairs above Pamela s Pamela s was closed of course but all the lights were on and we eventually figured out to ascend the staircase and seek out La Feria There was only one other table of diners so it was very quiet in the eating area There are about 15 tables and there are boldly colored Peruvian crafts everywhere you look We all decided to order lemonade and limeade which was a great choice The drinks were refreshing and fresh not too sour or too sweet I ordered one of the daily specials which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce It came with white rice a green salad with two kinds of cheese two tomatoes slices an olive red onion walnuts and light dressing and two slices of French bread The chicken itself was great the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice I really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and I looooove cheese The bread was pretty standard so I used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce Nom My boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich which I tasted Not as much meat as I d like but it was very juicy and flavorful Also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting For dessert we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them Everyone really enjoyed their meal It just feels like a good place to spend your money It s small it s cheap it s interesting food and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable I think we d be happy to go back if we were ever in the neighborhood I really want to taste those empanadas 
2js1f4it7yZAZeGY2nhU9w CMU Typical americanized Asian food that serves three stars As a broke college student within walking distance of Lulu s I continue to go there due to convenience and the sheer fact that it is exponentially better than college campus food The problem I have with Lulu s is not the food itself it is to be expected with the prices but it is with the service There is a definite inconsistency with the service and at times my friends and I are left waiting for someone to take our order for 20 minutes despite letting the hostess know how long we have been waiting Or chasing down a waitress for more water I don t know if they treat us like this because we are college students but I feel that service is one of their biggest weakness So come here if you want large portions for a fair price and don t expect too good of service But as long as I go to Carnegie Mellon and I am broke I will still go here 
2k3MofKieNIv5I5rXSxcOA CMU Nice atmosphere confusing concept A coworker and I had lunch at the porch a few weeks ago At lunch you place your order and are given an order number and can sit anywhere you like much like Hello Bistro which is run by the same organization We decided to eat outside since it was a nice day someone brought our iced teas and our meals quickly followed The pizza I ordered was good but we weren t sure how to get our iced teas refilled which didn t last very long on a 90 degree day There wasn t anyone going around so I eventually went inside and refilled our glasses with water from the self serve containers Great location ok food but a bit overpriced for self serve 
2KBC-pxd_KP6ZJ2J1wQv_Q CMU not really japanese food the menu of food is actually a big mix of random chinese and japanese food put together the sushi it self is poor the fish quality was really bad i sat at the bar to get a closer look and after the look i decided to get things that were safe to eat such as inari tofu pockets i always order safe and cooked things when i feel the fish might be a killer several hours later the cooked food is blah i ve had much better and i m pretty sure the grocery store frozen section is better miso was super super salty and grainy which im not a fan of overall i wont be coming back if i have a choice 
2kDDN5e_7BgPcKTPFYBpYQ CMU I was trying to decide whether to visit the Carnegie Museum of Art or the Museum of Natural History and decided to go with the art museum first Lo and behold your admission ticket to one gets you into the other at no charge and they re connected so you don t even have to go outside Score So two great museums for the price of one The art museum even on a Saturday afternoon was not crowded The galleries don t have the most intuitive layout and I kept feeling like I was missing something as I walked through the smallish rooms Still it was pretty easy to find the collections that most interested me The photography exhibit has some fantastic portraits and slices of Pittsburgh history The natural history museum on the other hand was full of kids of all ages running around among the dinosaur skeletons I spent less time wandering the exhibits of gemstones and preserved animals than I had spent with the art but still recommend checking out the badass dioramas of North American and African wildlife Overall a worthwhile diversion on a larger scale than you d expect in a city Pittsburgh s size with a bonus museum in the price of your ticket 
2KfdH5Vcu7nrba6UNhYghA CMU Thank you to Bonnie T who mentioned that Village Pizza had moved to 815 S Aiken Ave I will leave my review there BTW that move also came with a name change they are now S Aiken Bar and Grille I was so sad when I walked by the old Village Pizza and they were closed When I read that they had moved I walked to the address and was even more confused that it did not say Village Pizza 
2l-dX7tt_bswkb7R1q-1PQ CMU Best Thai food that I have ever had The good was amazing We had the dumplings crab ragoons and pad thai The food had great tast The waitress was very attentive The mood was relaxing There were candles and it looked over looked the street Sit by the window you won t regret it 
2LpjrcwpZ_6eSU337jeJ_g CMU Yum Rangoon night market noodles mango pork indonesian festival rice lemongrass beef all make me want to come to Pittsburgh more often Want to try new things on the menu but its hard to resist old favorities Can be hard to find parking or a table but its worth the trip 
2LQ9DtzeOUmX_udEJgGeLQ CMU I d prob give Soba 3 5 stars if I could We didn t want to drive in the snow so walked over to Soba on a Friday night and actually made reservations just an hour before we prob won t get away with that on a non stormy night After a blast of warm air I was welcomed into this dark cozy and seductive venue We were led up to the top level and settled in I ordered a Sapporo calamari and tuna Beer always hits the spot for me Calamari was delicious with a nice mayo sauce with a squirt of lime The tuna was tender My butter knife cut into it so easily The side of kimchi was just okay and the abundance of hot sauce sauce was to much for me Fried rice went well with everything and balanced the tuna and sauce out We then ordered the coconut cashew brownie which was delicious too as suggested by the waitress The portions were large imho and while the service was fantastic I just thought the food was priced a tad high for what was offered Seems like Soba would be nice for a special occasion or just to have a nice dinner though 
2lqOZhWKj2thSl-lELkYiQ CMU Open earlier than the Starbucks across the street They play good music and it s a much more laid back atmosphere Coffee is better and not as burnt or bitter 
2Lx26zkmMtAiUU--h25Srw CMU I really feel bad about giving a one star review First it s not about the service price decor or the food I m writing this review after going there twice The first time my husband and I went the dinner was good We thought this place has the potential to be our go to Chinese restaurant in Pgh Today I remembered that they have an early bird special 3 6pm m sat The won ton soup was not authentic more like chicken noodle soup but wasn t bad The entree was fine What really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco cigarette smell from the tea I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum The smell wouldn t leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine 2 3 minutes then brush as long as I could to get rid of the smell Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray first visit 3 stars second visit 5 stars 2 stars 
2n042gTdNDDLLRXWSUftLg CMU This place is a gem The food wine and service exceeded our expectations It s a great place to take a date or just get away for an excellent meal The place is a bit small so if you intend on going be sure to make a reservation a few days in advance on open table The chef apparently did his training in the Richmond VA area so you ll be able to see the southern influence in the menu For me the food completely changed my perception on what southern food could be I had a smoked pork shoulder with pureed sweet potatoes the flavor was indescribable My wife and I will pay this place a visit again for sure 
2NiuRQp2uOo0zC_CYVpZCA CMU What a production I don t even know where to start The place is small They didn t lie to me when I made the reservation Of course we had to pick the busiest day and time Saturday at 7pm The nice lady on the phone told me a reservation helps but we may still have to wait I did appreciate that tip from her Sure enough we showed up and it s PACKED The unfortunate thing is it was cold so eating on their patio was not going to happen Therefor people cram into what tiny space is allowed in the front But when I say tiny I really mean no space at all An older man pretty much barked orders at us and demanded to know if we had a reservation Thank God we did I was a little scared of him when he ran off muttering about no seating in you ain t got reservations So the first table of the restaurant is thee worst because people are standing on top of you jealously staring down at you and your food Of course we ended up with that table Thankfully our server and anyone else helping out was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable We started with the mussels app It came in a light garlic sauce and was a good amount of mussels I d say they were pretty tasty and I loved dipping the bread into the sauce The bread actually became my best companion that night more on that later I ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and mozz cheese I LOVE when Italian restaurants dump the sauce on and this was a winner I LOVE SAUCE I know some people aren t into that so I ll warn you if you like light sauce you WON T be happy After having gnocchi at Il Pizzaiolo in South Hills earlier that week I know I m on an Italian kick it didn t hold a candle to those light little pillows of pasta and potato The sauce though delicious Much to my husbands chagrin I had a hard time keeping myself from grabbing his plate He had the spinach and ricotta ravioli which I didn t have have a bite of but the SAUCE oh my Orgasmic I love tomato cream sauce and this was amazing I kept dipping my bread into his sauce with him increasingly getting annoyed Did I want to risk a fight for that delicious sauce maybe It was soooo good But the real action took place as we were finishing up our meal I had noticed the older dude owner walking around with a glass of red wine the whole time I thought that he was pretty rude but kinda funny in a typical Italian way Well I start to sense a commotion beside me and realize the owner and a server are in a heated convo Then the older dude screams get outta here you F A hole and then shoves him Whoa I was shocked a boss would do that to an employee Come to find out it s his son A woman who I assume was also part of management maybe even a family member came over to our table and apologized joked this was normal Italian behavior and offered us free dessert I thought that was really nice of her and and appreciated I just feel bad because those kind of things take down a business The good was great but witnessing that you wonder how long you can work like that Hopefully the dude can retire to a nice Italian villa with lots of wine instead of screaming at his son in the middle of his restaurant 
2Nvx6fctYsSuEKUSr3sNeQ CMU Any type of sentiment that you would like to express Kards Unlimited 5 1 has it in a card which I think all are ordered by the marker of the cards and then by the type of sentiment Because of the unique and grandiose assortment you can easily spend a few hours easily going through everything from cards and the other odds and ends books toys jewelry tshirts and so on I ve spent a fast 15 minutes looking for one thank you card by just being in the middle of the store not even tackling the back Rite Aid just doesn t even come close and I keep returning back whenever I want to snail mail a ray of sunshine to someone 
2nwhw66COV0xdkOmia7_BA CMU I had a terrible experience at Toast after enjoying it several times The food I was served was inedible and I have NEVER before sent food back in a restaurant I was told that they were too busy to make me anything else So I ate salad and dessert for dinner They didn t apologize or try to do anything to make it right I have contacted them numerous times since then and despite being told that it was just a bad night they have not done anything to make it up to me or to make me willing to return So disappointing 
2OiB3PRkovFTTcQlvEYqDQ CMU Went to Big Jim cause Guy went there before and there is not too much individual diner on yelp close by Ok the let s go have a average expectation Guy s recommendation bottom line is edible and sometimes have surprise but not this time Atmosphere is good like an average diner but places is not clean carpet smells and table is sticky that s ok food should be good Me and my wife order the Steak Hoagie comes with salad and the Spaghetti and meat sauce with 2 meat ball extra Salad came first it is a mix wit shredded iceberg lettuce grape style tiny tomato some purple cabbage with home salad dressing Lettuce is DARK BAD and MUSSY since I was on vacation I worry I had stomach ache so I skip it The Steak Hoagie for five buck I give a 2 thumbs up bread is soft hot and toast on spot although the mayo on the sandwich is quite a bit the outcome balance the steak with fresh sliced tomato some shredded iceberg lettuce then question coming how come the salad iceberg lettuce are so sucks pls prepare as per order instead it is not a fast food joint Last and I never come back is the meat ball the Spaghetti and meat sauce I don t know how to describe how could it be like this I am pretty sure Guy s taste bud is excellent no doubt but this is too much and hit my bottom line for food spaghetti is ok not too soggy just a little more watery About the meat sauce is ok but taste like can sauce and fresh tomato and shredded meat mix together still ok edible I will give a pass BUT THE MEAT BALL OMG taste like 1 it is mussy pretty bland 2 it taste weird then I try to smells it OMG I threw all of them on the plate it smells like shit it either over cook or something wrong At the end of today I did went to washroom 2 times I am pretty sure I will not come back 
2oWYvenLVc-EJP_NWI8sJQ CMU Best Indian I have had so far in Pittsburgh Food is well spiced and the saag is probably the best I have ever had Naan left a little bit to be desired Service is a bit sloppy slow easily flustered but friendly nonetheless They got my order wrong and didn t offer to fix it probably because I was happy with what they sent out and had already eaten half of it All in all I will go back 
2p5CmCV541yjoSb24DtIRQ CMU Fusion is difficult to pull off well Have you ever noticed that Fusion almost always involves East Asian food and American cuisine Thai corn chowder Are they really going crazy for corn chowder in Chang Mai You never find say Mexican Moroccan or Ethiopian Brazilian fusion places That would be really inventive Instead with Soba you have another pan Asian American Fusion joint although I don t think I ve been to a better one The mussels are incredible a meal in themselves and a bargain at 9 I had the chopped salad with fresh mango avocado mint and just a hint of spice The best meal I ve had here was the mussels followed by the tuna The crabcakes are also good made with lump crabmeat If you feel like something vaguely Asian but not too Asian ex kimchee pancakes you won t find a better option But if you want something truly original you have to go elsewhere 
2pEFfCFN27LPNyLOXV9iTg CMU The pastrami sandwiches are sooooooooooooooo good AND it has fries on it It s huge and horrible for you but you ll love it 
--4ZeOLUj8XU86mUFFJMTA Columbia Our server was really really nice And the food came very quickly So that was all A OK I didn t love our food though We tried the bibimbap and it wasn t very flavorful though This is the first time I ve tried it so I m honestly not sure what it s supposed to taste like But I m guessing it s not supposed to be bland The appetizers and the soup that came with the meal were a lot better in my opinion 
--b0bnY1J8dE4NlCUsR-Pg Columbia Convenience store with all the things I love to munch on Shrimp chips Coffee things in cans Sushi to order Great bet to get a snack or a quick meal thing 
-08tPj7h6CmxsidEWPF6kg Columbia Lucky lucky me to live so close to this gem of an eatery Fantastic place to share a meal with friends or family I had not had Ethiopian cuisine before this place but have since in other establishments No one has yet compared to Zoma s flavors bright spiced perfectly subtle richness Great healthy sized portions too Their service is always friendly and the waitstaff is happy to recommend dishes suited to your cravings Upscale decor with reasonably priced meals and cocktails Go to ZOMA 
-0m1gIBZYugRW3_BIW_gig Columbia Have you ever seen a pizza as big as a man If not then go to Koronet s A single slice has the geographic area of 3 smaller slices put together with thin crust with just the right amount of crisp I first sampled koronet s after eating at Thai Market in the Upper West Side We skipped dessert and opted for pizza instead The sickness that followed was worth every bite 
-0TPsW9pF2h83XdIkkrr8A Columbia This spot is adorable It has the feel of being inside a vintage jewelry box if you had been shrunken down like the fairies in Sleeping Beauty The yellow walls beautiful light fixtures and charming details throughout Campo made me feel cozy and excited for a great time The food was delicious even though I made the odd and not to be repeated choice of Sweet Polenta It wasn t bad just too dessert y for a main course even at brunch All you can drink brunch alcohol at 9 90 was a plus The only downside was disinterested and slow service In fact we got some tude from a waiter because we asked for bread when we weren t his table Poor form So I hope the service improves if not I may have to lose a new favorite brunch option 
-0URAGOE6zYQcg7ZQLAKbw Columbia I don t have anything against Rite Aids in particular But this one She is not so good Don t go if you enjoy activities like walking in unobstructed aisles or finding the very thing you went in there for Close to the subway stop though But so is Duane Reade And Chipotle In fact just say fuck it and go to Chipotle instead Burrito always trumps shampoo 
-0YLvW033BiUDNq4jkESZw Columbia Easily the worst haircut I ve ever received in my life And I feel like I m letting you Yelpers down because I cannot for the life of me remember my stylists name I was looking for a short cut that would be flattering on curly hair so called and asked for a stylist that could do curly I was told everyone could and was given the name of a senior stylist Well when I get there the lady assigned to me god help her looked terrified to cut my hair and had really no idea what to do Plus her own hair looked like it had been chewed on When I told her what I wanted she said Like that and points to a lady with a 1980 s PTA Mom haircut to which I reply The exact opposite of that Please god nothing like that Was she even a senior stylist Why didn t I just leave So she cuts And cuts And cuts Friends ask me why I didn t stop her and I said because it looked horrible and I wanted her to keep cutting until it looked better It never looked better She looked disheartened with her job and yet still charged 80 tip WTF It looked like a curly Marge Simpson Kid and Play And I m being generous This was the only time in my life that I ve ever contemplated shaving my head I am certain that there are stylists here that can do a good job but solely based on the fear of anyone having their hair cut by the same woman that did mine only go if you get a glowing recommendation from someone who loves their stylist there and can show you proof of their talent I took a chance and fell flat on my face Not to be trusted 
-108yMSyt-UUyvYtqcPxFg Columbia As other reviewers have noted this place is SUCH a bargain Just to gloss over the highlights 20 prix fixe from 6 8 BYOB with no corkage fee great service and adorable set up I heart the location because it s near my hood I went there on a Thursday night with my supper club there were 6 of us and we all enjoyed it immensely Clearly it s darn popular the place was completely full when we took our leave at 9 30 PM The place is impressive for its originality The menu is classic quality ORGANIC French food but with a Carribean twist For instance the pate is not like any other pate I ve ever had It is an amalgamation of deliciousness it has a BRIE crust yum I thought the cheese made the dish a bit oily but that didn t stop me from asking my dinner companion for a second taste Or a third Also their home style meatloaf is seitan rather than meat and was one of the best dishes I sample I supremely enjoyed my appetizer and entree I opted for the grilled hass avocado and the roast duck leg confit The appetizer was divinity herself I have never tasted anything like it in my life With each bite I closed my eyes and attempted to dissect each component in the shitake sesame dressing I however was distracted by the sheer pleasure of the flavor combination and failed in this mission The duck leg confit was good The flavor was right on but the duck was a bit overcooked for my taste My meal here was a blast I d recommend this place to anyone Of course the 4 bottles of wine my party finished off could be a contributing or convoluted if you will factor towards my attitude 
-1fCWRFoZ69sqOYiPb6yeA Columbia I had brunch with my sister here a couple of days ago and the food was scrumptious I had a mozzarela sandwich with roasted tomatoes and peppers And my sister had an eggs benedict 
-1Mz7H7oDr8hFMqTRvL4EQ Columbia Aloo anything and Lamb roti rolls are the way to go Add goat cheese for that extra flava Their mango lassi isn t that great but ok in a pinch if it s 3 AM and you re thirsty Gotta love Indian fast food 
-247_tXug8FN1abRp7L5oA Columbia At the urging from some out of town guests to visit Smoke we decided to try it out WOW From the moment we arrived Frank one of the owners greeted us at the door Immediately you realize how intimate inviting relaxed the place is Susan our server was awesome The music was great the food delicious we took Susan s recommendation had the Coq au Vin and the Roasted Chicken I m not really much of a dessert person but the Brownie Sundae was to die for What a great place Living downtown there are tons of places to go but Smoke is definitely worth the trip uptown We re looking forward to returning to try brunch on the weekend 
-2_xNAFEh8Qt2jsdvyC2hA Columbia I m all for the benefit of the doubt so it was hard for me to give it 2 stars but as adorable as this restaurant is It really wasn t the best experience which could account for all the open seats on a Friday night The menu is a conglomerate of American and Japanese I tend to fear any amalgamated menus It usually means the restaurant isn t sure what it wants to be and therefore is not good at being anything at all I went with the American side of the menu Started with Coconut shrimp and dumplings Both seemed pre made not the worst taste just nothing special although my date enjoyed the dumplings For entrees it was the burger and Jambalaya The entrees were as the appetizers unexciting The Jambalaya was a large portion but pretty soupy and low on shrimp sausage and anything other than rice and liquid The burger laid quietly next to the fries hoping that who ever came in contact with it would be hungry enough to devour it I d love to say that since we were one of the only two tables that we received exceptional service I cannot Our server changed 3 times from seating and drinks to actual ordering Luckily we weren t in a hurry or super thirsty because after our food was dropped off We were left to our own devices we were there for an hour and to an angry waitress who would ve much rather lit candles than drop our check 
-3Jr74objsR5HJP27XhzqA Columbia We went on the third day that they were open I was very pleased to see by the prices that it is not trying to be a destination restaurant which is exactly what this neighborhood needs It reminded me of Fiore in Brooklyn which also has a standard menu and a good price point I spoke to one of the owners who said that there are three owners one of whom is the chef They are experienced owners who have had at least four other restaurants on the West side They came here because of the reasonable rents For all those who were wondering the reason it took so long was that they had to bring the building up to code He said it cost them a lot of time and money It was obviously a headache They don t have their license yet BYOW more furniture is coming and they have plans to open for lunch and breakfast but the owner said Let s get dinner right first They would like to do pizza too but that seemed further down the road The side door indicates that there might be outdoor seating come spring The room is spacious loud and weirdly bright the last perhaps to let people know they are open or because it was so early We ate with the family crowd and there were over a dozen kids when we left A family of four can afford to eat here at 9 a pasta which I think will help ensure their success I had the veggie lasagna which was nice and flavorful and yes had peas which is a weird touch but the lasagna was light enough that I didn t care The plain spaghetti was tasty and filling and easy for kids to eat The puttanesca was tasty and not too salty which it often is but the meat lasagna and ragu were a little over salted The service was attentive and friendly Butter with the bread no olive oil Overall it was incredibly satisfying to sit on FDB and have a decent meal at a reasonable price I would say they hit the mark on one of the services that this neighborhood has been missing Now if they could only get a pizza oven Welcome Frizzante 
-42oDLhMJiZnTniQuaX58w Columbia If you really hate yourself and those around you please come here for lunch and remember to order the lukewarm and viscous thai curry 
-44qH1H5LaW530X9QmIgeQ Columbia A place where you can actually find something for everyone Creole American Mexican and even Japanese Another great find where most of the entrees are under 20 The soft spoken waiter excelled at his job Bread basket was great I finally found cornbread I like The creole chicken and shrimp with red pepper chipotle sauce was off the hook You get a lot of food enough for lunch the next day Comes with lump free mashed potatoes and delicious spinach that soaked up all of the garlic I will recommend this place to my friends up there and cannot wait to come back Dunno about the lounge though 
-4NNj9_J_ILWaWWzYrQvxg Columbia When they say Giant Burrito you better believe you are getting a giant burrito This isn t any Chipotle burrito this is huge Also it s great for vegetarians and it s totally two meals worth of food Delish horchata 
-4xxufc8Mjl5ICTLorv4jQ Columbia If you re looking for brunch on the UWS then I recommend you spend a couple extra bucks at Community across the street it is worth it It pains me that I m considered a regular here because I only ever come here under protest my darling wife loves meeting people for brunch Seriously go to Community instead it is more expensive but worth it Deluxe is a big letdown 
-5Y2Ki_0i1YALt6cZZPOmg Columbia I love this place I don t go as often as I used to because I moved a little further away and I ll caution that it is pretty expensive But I don t know a place that makes a better sandwich Their Italian tuna is the best tuna I ve had Their soups are also amazing They taste homemade there s always 4 5 different varieties and a quart with free bread goes a long way My one gripe makes me sound like a curmudgeon but everything keeps changing there Some of the changes are good sure the increased selection the addition of a sushi chef their willingness to sell slices of whole cakes instead of insisting you buy the whole beautiful costly thing But I ll end up trying a new product that looks delicious and high quality only to see it disappear shortly after Peppermint ice cream I m thinking of you It s also much harder to justify the prices now that they ve done away with their frequent shopper cards 
-5z-2YPiSLF5lQh8czHjZA Columbia ollie s works just fine if you happen to be at columbia university and need a quick bite the food is perfectly acceptable but nothing special on that basis i would have given it three stars the problem though is this busy eatery feels kind of dirty you wouldn t really feel that if you were doing takeout but the last two times that i ate there i sat at the back of the restaurant from there i got a full view of the bathroom doors and the messy stack of spare chairs etc this restaurant need to be a little better organized 
-6oO1oowJLzKoztZ3LIayQ Columbia I was so excited when this shop opened up a few years ago It was the only decent wine store in the neighborhood I ve been going there periodically ever since and I have always had very mixed experiences there It s a lovely shop and fun to stop in but for someone like me who loves wine but knows nothing about it I always have a total complex the minute I walk into a wine store I feel like people are laughing at me or something Well Harlem Vintage is no exception I have generally found the staff there to be unfriendly and unwelcoming They are helpful enough but just kind of I don t know cold I would have given this place four stars until a few months ago when a new wine shop opened up in the area It is at 117th and Fredrick Douglass called The Winery They are a smaller store but have more bottles in the 10 range and are ALWAYS tasting The guy that works there is about a million times nicer than anyone at Harlem Vintage If Harlem Vintage changes their vibe and starts carrying cheaper wines I ll probably start going there again 
-6whHrTnakGO512T7dJC_Q Columbia Slice of Harlem is perhaps the worst expensive pizza I have ever had When I moved to this neighborhood I was disappointed beyond belief After visiting Pizzeria 123 with a friend I realized good pizza for inexpensive amounts of money is hard to find Pizzeria 123 has pizza rice and beans for real hamburgers fries etc etc Yes it s nothing classy or something I die for on a Friday night but when I m hungry I ll be here Plus it s close by 
-6wiQyvttfwR7tm0ux_XCw Columbia Of all the Westside Markets this one feels the most cramped and labyrinthine But it s a good deal in the Columbia neighborhood and it s open 24 hours 
-6xpZtLRmEEsVgrZokqHCw Columbia First off I m not a big fan of the location of R S but beside that the food is quality So when we sat down we were asked for drinks and greeted with warm biscuits Which I was EXTREMELY weary off considering that southern biscuits are usually really doughy But I noticed they were light and fluffy and they also have some sort of sweet glaze on top Delicious point blank Then came our ribs which were amazing and the sides mac and cheese potato salad collards all were to die for The chicken smothered and fried are both wonderful The chicken is not oily but just right and tender as well as perfectly seasoned Everything was great But I have heard from my friend who introduced me to the place at first that it is not as good as it used to be Now i don t know what this is about but i will say this much I think another visit will do this place justice And the decor is nothing too drastic to comment on so all in all I m a fan 
-7F14FbLo-LKy2MlqEp9KA Columbia Stopped by this place for a drink because I was in the area and the place looked inviting Great move the staff was very friendly and welcoming Happy hour was awesome not to mention it was lobster night yummy Live music open air friendly faces good drinks and pretty good food Go for it 
-7l6i45Zsat3oqmanUXZ5g Columbia Oh Milano Market Your amazing soups and unlimited bread slices have been there for me when it was 20 degrees outside and I needed to be warm Your fabulous salads fed me when I had nothing else to eat And the sandwiches Don t even get me started on the sandwiches The boyfriend always orders the chicken parm because he is unimaginative but lately he discovered the pastrami which is excellent I m more of a turkey girl myself but I do love how each sandwich maker finds a way to make the same turkey brie and honey mustard unique And then there is the bakery The chocolate cheesecake is to die for I haven t done much grocery shopping there but I do love how they have the most random things like Kinder surprise that I can t find anywhere else even though they were such a huge part of my childhood Milano I will love you forever and always Please never change 
-7unsnDYnnsUyjIqUqgcrw Columbia We got the groupon and went here tonight for our anniversary dinner the view is great the decor very old and the atmosphere was very strange Outside it seems to be much nicer than in side but there was no serving Service was pretty good and fast Food was average we branzino fish it was tasty but very small i had veal it was good on some parts other parts were raw and not eatable for me the wine list is very small we had to ask for it We will not go again i don t think it s romantic like others here most people were above 50 at the place there a tons of better places in the city they are overpriced i like to spend on good food but this food should be 15 less per entree 
-88FeYt1YW7t7jWaP3LyNQ Columbia Smoke is a great evening out Delicious food fantastic drinks and GREAT jazz Fully sensory experience and everything a delight I usually like quieter smaller venues for jazz and I often find live music jarring when eating but Smoke is a celebration of life If you want to feel good about life this is the way Try the smoked shrimp and watermelon or the crab sandwich for some flavor it s hard to find elsewhere 
-8MwIPChqAB2BZo98NViUA Columbia The food is mediocre but we ve been using them because they accept credit cards and we rarely keep cash on us DO NOT USE A CREDIT CARD HERE I had two orders within five days and wound up being charged three times twice for two different amounts on the same day I called them and the manager said he runs the receipts at the end of the night himself and that sometimes this happens Would I please wait one week and see if it came off This was the FIRST warning it happens sometimes He s obviously doing something wrong Well it was fair to wait so I did I called him a week later when the amount still hadn t come off He was obviously annoyed with me and got very short on the phone He kept insisting I do nothing illegal over and over I replied that I understood that but there had been a mistake and it needed to be fixed The amount was 36 20 and had come directly out of my checking account I wasn t happy He insisted the credit card company had looked into it and was working on the 20 00 mistake I reminded him that it was 36 20 and he started getting even louder with me We ended it with him giving me his cell number so I could send him a screen shot of my statement that clearly showed the three charges I sent it to him and waited two days to hear from him When I didn t hear from him I texted him since I always called at a bad time for him his words asking if he had a refund for me yet I waited another day and STILL did not hear from him Hence my reviews here If this is how he conducts business at this restaurant STAY AWAY There are MANY better places to get good Chinese food from This place has neither good food nor good business practices 
-8RTjx-zTyaPSk1dBAR10Q Columbia First off Welcome to the neighborhood Joe I want to love Joe but I guess I can enjoy but not swoon The place is almost always packed with no room to sit strange acoustics and open decor that doesn t let you forget well even if it s a coffee shop it s still within a Columbia University building The staff at Joe are really friendly and cheerful a nice experience when you go to order coffee At 2 a cup it s a little pricey If they had more seating space it would be worth it For now I ll just go back and forth between them and Starbucks Nonetheless it s nice to have another coffee option in the area 
-8zUs-vR4CmrABqUobRNaA Columbia This is my fav neighborhood salon Very chic and friendly at the same time Miryam gives an awesome Brazilian She s super fast the smell of the chocolate wax is relaxing and she leaves you wonderfully hair free The owner is down to earth and always willing to accommodate walk ins who don t have an appt Love the vibe 
-9gjViwgOdEwiuct55XBOA Columbia I was excited o try Mel s Burger Bar so I went with two friend on Saturday night That will be the last time I go there In their defense it was busy But crowded on a Saturday night is no excuse for miserable service It was hard to get our server s attention He was quite nice when he came by but he didn t come by enough I ordered a beer they have a permanent menu with a great selection of beers and they had just finished the keg After I changed my order to a shake I thought about it and got confused were they really out of one of the beers on their permanent menu If it was just an issue of changing out the keg I would have waited I did end up waiting anyway Our food took an obscene amount of time After we ordered we waited They brought my shake I drank my shake My friends finished their drinks And we waited And more waiting And no food Our waiter began avoiding eye contact When we did get his attention he totally sold the kitchen down the river saying Yeah I have no idea what s up in there They re really slow tonight Maybe that s true dude but maybe you should have apologized to us rather than commiserating as though you re suffering too Finally finally our food came Well most of it Their menu specifically states that all burgers are medium unless you ask for something different One of us had ordered her burger rare and yet all three of our burgers were cooked to different temperatures Mine was rare one was well done and the friend who wanted rare got medium She sent it back They apologized We waited And waited Her burger came back a second time and was not what she ordered She took it anyway we d been waiting more than 30 minutes for food at that point but we were all disappointed They comped her burger fwiw You know what the worst part was The burgers were good Like really good But it wasn t enough sadly It didn t compensate for bad service an unnecessarily loud environment where you couldn t hear anyone speak or the fact that the place turned into a hip bar with people standing around drinks in hand bumping against tables 
-9v5sjnEpqfhFsOzZ-nr2Q Columbia Great food Great service Wonderful atmosphere Been here many times My only two nits 1 Their menu is a bit limited Could use a few more choices 2 They do not accept American Express at last check but it has been a good few months since I ve been there 
-9Wl7i8xjS5ZhFtTwhLc8Q Columbia The Underground Lounge is a nice small cozy bar Through a door is another room where live music is played which you can enjoy the food drinks and music The spaces are tight but you forget that once music starts playing and you re just loosening yourself up The food there is pretty good I do recommend the fish tacos and pizzettes They don t skimp out on the ingredients or portions The pizzette was the best a lot of cheese and tomato on a flatbread that was crunchy and irresistable I could ve devour the whole pie myself but I had to share dam friends Service was nice but once we moved into the other room the food took a while to come out and service was getting slower Overall definitely not a bad place to order some food and listen to live music being played If you want more privacy and quiet stay at the bar to chit chat Note beware of the stairs going up and down into the bar it can be tricky after you have a couple of drinks 
-9YA5xRaj0GYY1qE-1eQ4w Columbia Most of their pastry is Hungarian but staff is unfriendly and not knowledgable let alone Hungarian They don t accept cards Meh and I m Hungarian 
-A1ALp8D_uJKPlA3mH9JnA Columbia Nothing special to note Typical Dive bar 
-a6IJ1zFW72uVk7M9VutMA Columbia Excellent selection despite the confusing layout Employees are helpful It was a saving grace when I was in art history 
-aduu0ZQLVLM6BTZjitA-Q Columbia Ate here for restaurant week two summers ago before I discovered yelp and it looks like they have since closed We came for the view which we couldn t enjoy because of a storm and then were seated inside right next to the 90 year old harp player Soup was cold entrees were bland the seat cushions had stains on them and the worst part is there was a fly flying around our table Hope the new management makes necessary updates and takes advantage of that space 
-AEXfzPuwLyqkx_KLSHH2Q Columbia Casual nice setting on a calm block and the food is delish Presentation was on point and I had the baked lasagna which was probably THEE best lasagna I ve ever had the pleasure of consuming smh still thinkin about it 
-AfCBkLvS6yrpPi5Kcb9Kw Columbia I love getting breakfast delivered from Hamilton Quick friendly delivery guys and cheap considering other options around here HOWEVER ever since the girl that use to take the orders over the phone left the gentleman that now takes orders cannot seem to get it right Mind you he messed up once before and I was forgiving So on my second order I said it slow and repeated it he still messed up my order argh Hamilton do something about him 
-AhwIxS6dgEGqiz5GhgYtA Columbia Slices the size of the Bronx Q How does Koronet keep the price so low on a slice so big while featuring such high quality ingredients A They don t Like so much else in life Koronet Pizza obeys the law that what can t be done isn t So don t imagine you are getting top quality ingredients If you want to maximize calories per dollar this is your place If you just need some modestly healthy cheap eats in the neighborhood try Maoz across the street Jerusalem falafel and more on Broadway between 103 104 or check out La Fonda Mexicana on Amsterdam near 108 
-aLQrrhSVxSPiTjXxxGc5Q Columbia The menu is a little uninspired and the flavor of the food does not warrant the price tag Nice ambiance good service 
-azBnSDdchkkpKul2urRhg Columbia Definitely the worst experience I ve ever had at a dry cleaners They took all the buttons off of my Diane Von Furstenberg blouse which incidentally said Diane Von Furstenberg on them well actually her initials DVF I think these people remove the buttons from nice clothing and then put them on clothing that they make and try to pass them off as genuine garments Word to the wise Don t go here they will rip you off and destroy your clothes 
-bdpFpaPrOPnM-faFbWLrg Columbia Do you like having the option to drink great beer or crappy beer sit next to a happy young couple or a pack of brahs know exactly when you re in the best table in the corner on the roof or worst table the one by the front door The Heights is downright schizophrenic Sometimes it s really nice sometimes it s a pain The food ranges from pretty tasty jerk chicken to standard fried whatever and of course they ve got what you re really looking for which is above average sports bar fare I love rooftop dining and drinking and this place has a very comfortable roof so I ll end up there pretty often if I m out with a group whose tastes I don t know that well 
-bg55uYFdckcPoKoiAJZxw Columbia This was a horrific experience Significant portion of the class time was spent on learning how great it is to be positive and smile Reading exercises made up only a fraction of the class time I had to leave during the break in the post lunch session because it was a huge waste of time A lot of people were rolling their eyes through the class my neighbor said it was the strangest class she took in her life I don t recommend this to anyone 
-bgxDvpmcAt6UJuH5COInQ Columbia Ollie s is a joke amongst the Chinese citizens of the Columbia community They make fun of this place for claiming to serve Chinese food and they laugh about the clueless American diners who pay to eat it I have to admit that a few years ago I would stop by Ollie s for their spinach wonton soup on weekends However I was also on a strict diet at the time and noticed that I enjoyed every source of nourishment immensely In any case Ollie s has failed to impress me with any of their other dishes Their pork buns have little filling and are strangely sour wtf I once tried to order the General Tso s Chicken Americanized Chinese at its best and partway through eating the first piece I realized it was not fully cooked I cut all the other nuggets in half on my plate and discovered that 100 of them had bright pink middles What s really strange is that the cooked parts of the chicken were extremely dry which confused me about as much as the first time I had a Baked Alaska how do they bake ice cream cake without having it melt Another time I got their Taro Bubble Tea no bubbles Really if I had wanted a glass of milk with some purple food coloring I could have gotten it a lot cheaper at Morton Williams In any case I keep being forced to go to lunch meetings at this place and it upsets me because I really want Ollie s go out of business so a real restaurant can take over this little corner 
-bI_7IgE-2_20dugb6jasg Columbia I never write Yelp reviews especially about a glasses store so that alone should say a lot about my experience here This Cohen s used to be nothing special I went back last month for the first time in a few years and had a great visit They have a new manager Narine and she went completely out of her way to build a genuine relationship with me She gave me honest opinions about my frame selections and didn t act anything like a saleswoman She was just there as a great resource Did I mention she also offered me cookies I obliged Also Dr Wu is great and knowledgeable and I can tell she really cares about her patients Since my purchase I stop in Cohen s when I m in the neighborhood There is a great positivity that I really appreciate so I often jump in just to say hello I am confident I will never shop for glasses anywhere else 
-Bi_c6qJ9MvzymhyS4e6Bg Columbia the live music was awesome but don t sit too close to the stage or you won t hear your party the food was scrumptious and the drinks were made to perfection the crowd was young diverse and professional i can t say enough about this place 
-boMFS0BkY21bQa8zR6FDg Columbia It makes me so happy to see a banh mi shop in the neighborhood The sandwich isn t 100 authentic I go to Chinatown Seattle southern California or Saigon for that but Q Q is so much better than Subway and even Lenny s I don t live within their delivery radius but they will deliver if I ask nicely and order a minimum of 15 The two people who have answered the phone when I ve called are very friendly So I order 3 sandwiches at a time one to eat immediately and the other two refrigerate well You can pop them in the oven to toast them up to a day or two later I ve also ordered the wings and chicken tenders from there Those aren t too good though Stick to the sandwiches 
-bOMpQ8jX4RUb-YDLNZRCg Columbia Definitely a trip down college memory lane which oversized bar food and huge frozen drinks This is a nice place to casually hang out with a group of friends for a descent price Don t expect phenomenal food drinks but instead cheap prices and a super casual environment 
-BsvdDYsZ86z6Y4YAfWajA Columbia The food was so good I shouldve given 5 stars but the service is weak If they improve their service they would be unstoppable I got the Jerk chicken and it was the best I have had in the States The yams are also super sweet and yummy Love this place and I will be back despite the wack service 
-B_XanvTSgezRfoLeuKUbA Columbia Great bagels What a selection Once you decide on the bagel then you have to pick a cream cheese I chose olive and pimento and really enjoyed it Was glad that we went the distance to check this place out while we were in NYC 
-CiAdd1zfd5QgVwDOSWniA Columbia The food was very tasty great price and big portions Its a very laid back atmosphere The service is a bit slow and the waiter messed up our order bringing stewed chicken instead of jerk chicken and tried to play if off like she brought jerk She also messed up our side orders but the food was so tasty we didnt care Will def go back and try to put more emphasis on the sides 
-Cje6v2ztKfeHl5kLEdFtA Columbia Their garlic bread is to die for This is all you should come here for Their pasta was average and a weird mix of watery but also too creamy GET THE GARLIC BREAD 
-cshNPMz56k1rydPJE6KFQ Columbia Good bubble tea for the area They sell a lot of other Asian snacks food desserts but I ve only tried their bubble tea which is not the best in NYC but good enough glad this place exists 
-cwMBp-Fr2FiSRcfpwML3A Columbia this place is pretty cool granted i didnt try any of the food but the ambiance is great they have a solid beer selection as well as some nightly specials this place is a very solid spot to come to and this is when it was cold out they have a fairly large outdoor area for seating and im sure during the spring summer times its pretty bumping i hope to try this place out again most definitely 
-CWYIjz9lyJf7B35m0AqPw Columbia Crepes on Columbus is a cute little establishment I ve passed by it on several occasions and have always thought about trying it After seeing a Groupon offer it was just meant to be I came here for late lunch with my bf on a Monday afternoon and we were the only ones there I ordered a savory crepe with smoked salmon and basil cream It was seriously out of this world amazing My bf who attests crepes and anything creamy was also in love I am definitely coming back for the food and the service was just the cherry on top 
-cx3ilWSfur8c_w2wG3NKA Columbia Happy hour drink specials only downstairs not on the roof Very tasty frozen drinks that due lead to high levels of intoxication Strangely enjoyed the Salisbury fries served with gravy Food is so so and it is a lot of barely legal or not yet legal college kids for the most part 
-D2SaVqFXsslY4dWI-Midg Columbia It kind of sounds like my friends and I came on a good day where it wasn t too crowded where the noise wasn t too loud and where the bartender was particularly nice Yes Pourhouse is grungy But I like it It reminds me of my college days and I find that rad Not for every night but this night was good There is a pretty decent selection on tap though not that I could see any beer deals that I felt I could get in on However we felt like we could stay for a long time and just be One thing though do yourself a favor and if you sit in the smaller part of the bar do NOT sit facing the kitchen When the phone rings a practically seizure inducing light will blink It was a bit disconcerting 
-dH7qEOGhTFUBAg5PVBvnw Columbia i usually don t give 2 star reviews unless the place really bothered me while that is not true of the thai market the pad thai was 3 star and 10 price made it 2 star come to think of it i guess i ve only had pad thai at once place oh well it s better there 
-DlE9nZKQi7XzWSEvkPWhw Columbia Beautifuly decorated Don t come here if you re hungry though We waited about 45 minutes to get our food during Sunday brunch hour The burger was decent but nothing special Please hire some more staff 
-DRkoQZXKT98SpbqMtm4lQ Columbia The food here is amazing and reasonably priced Try the eggplant for an appetizer and then the pasta dishes are perfect fresh ravioli is great 
-dwIaF5_Nl9IML4mFg57GA Columbia Great little bistro in the middle of Columbia area The hostess was efficient and promptly seated us It was interesting that the restaurant ran out of scallops so for their Cioppino entree they are just going to drop them For 28 5 you d think they d offer to adjust That said ordered the pork chop and the skirt steak both of which were great The pork belly salad was not so great I understand pork belly to be fatty but for the salad we got slabs of pork fat Table set up is also weird as no one got salt or pepper and it takes the wait staff a bit of time to hunt pepper down Overall average to slow service but friendly 
-dWvOvG7FVsF-T_0JkZVkg Columbia Amazingly good Mexican in NYC I m a Cali girl at heart and I love a REAL burrito and this is the best I ve had in the Northeast I went to Tortilleria Nixtamal in Queens because of all the hype and was disappointed but without fanfare this place is the real deal 
-e6OIjNhi62ZdbBuk6W9xQ Columbia I found a curly hair baked into my empanada Sure it s not as bad as the knife a poor man found in his sandwich at Subway but jaysus you would think they would not have such problems with premade food during opening week After apologizing and giving me another order the staff nervously proclaimed that this has never happened Whatever Maybe they should wear hairnets it wouldn t clash that much with the Pinkberry inspired decor The empanadas I tried Chicken Argentine Beef and Caprese mozzerella basil tomato were dry and lacked flavor I had to drink a 1 2 bottle of guava juice to impart some moisture to the filling At 3 38 a pop it s still an offense to get food this bad especially when Roti Roll is just 2 blocks away 
-E7sGLueiBb7CDpdemSrwQ Columbia I know how do you go to a burger bar and not get a burger I don t really know I can explain except for saying I just wasn t in the mood for a burger Things I ate that you ll definitely like sweet potato fries buffalo chicken wings and fried Oreos not the best I ve had but pretty awesome Things I ate that you might like fish tacos a little bland and I don t like corn tortillas the cabbage and avocado were a nice touch turkey burger Things I ate that you can skip bbq chicken sliders overly saucy not much going on besides chicken and bread needed lettuce and tomato Things I ll eat next time a burger Happy eating 
-ea-94M0jT5TDhyo-WGOgQ Columbia It s really the only place around here you can get some of these items Prices tend to be pretty good for the supermarket section Not sure about the deli or sushi I like the drink selection as well 
-ECSF0iJL6ygLgnkj6uGaw Columbia how common 
-eEoyYBgx4lr5XtYava6sw Columbia So full But so right I stopped by with a friend earlier this evening to grab a bite before heading home it s a Sunday night after all and we were curious to try the place after hearing so much about it Am I glad I did We ordered the Big Mel 10 oz burger w Wisconsin bacon and all the type of cheese they had in house the cowboy bacon mushrooms chili onion strings on a 10 oz burger and the disco fries gravy scallions melted cheese Plus milkshakes and we were rolling home And did I mention they sell growlers of beer 
-EkFAP8WuHQua_OlyPVt0A Columbia I was just here for lunch Cute space and not too crowded though that could be because Columbia s out for the summer The wine the server recommended was definitely not bad The grilled calamari was tasty but it was really a salad though not advertised as such A ton of lettuce but a very small portion of squid We both had pasta mains that were good enough but nothing special Service is friendly if hovering 
-ELk3wYLvwPV9ccvl2WBPA Columbia The burgers are a bit small but extremely satisfying We strolled into Mel s yesterday for the first time At first we were a bit apprehensive due to the volume of the music but my hunger desire for a burger won out and we got a table My husband started with Popcorn Shrimp and I with Buffalo Wings Both were excellent Peter went onto a Cadillac Burger and I the California Equally Excellent We loved the food and the atmosphere once the music was turned down The service was adequate Prices are a bit high but aren t they high everywhere I ll pay the price for food this good 
-ePPWScKR1jYUbg8_VxQvQ Columbia I m amending my review still attached below Once Victor left and another great guy who worked there it was left being run by this fussy little obnoxious bicycle enthusiast I can t recall his name Not important I have not been back there in quite some time and instead go to Broadway Liquors on Bway and 105 Nicer staff and better prices One of the best liquor stores in NYC Victor rocks They recently renovated and the overall look and vibe is upscale The staff is gracious and knowledgeable They also host tastings that are decidedly for people who want to learn AND have fun Simply it s the place to go to find a wide range of spirits and wine that have prices that offer something for everyone To their continued success Cheers 
-eta-4DMn2ZVQ92R9vXuEQ Columbia I enjoyed a relaxing hot tea and appetizers here after a long day of work and evening classes My friend enjoyed a cold beer but it s allergy season so I had a hankering for a hot tea We were lucky that it was late enough a little after 9pm to snag a spot outdoors I have walked by Amsterdam Restaurant Tapas Lounge many times and never knew how great their menu was I should have know it was more than just outdoor seating that keeps this place busy at all hours This will certainly become one of my favorite post class spots to unwind and enjoy good food 
-FdEKTiARoPhJg6j-6EXrw Columbia Lovely park My husband and I biked through the park specifically because we loved the movie You ve Got Mail It is so beautiful and LONG we rode all the way down the park right along the Hudson River It was so relaxing and much calmer than Central Park A much more peaceful place to hang out and enjoy the day 
-ffCqnLt6LVDmfm79CHfZw Columbia Unlike other reviewers I m not a big fan of Korean food but every so often I get an urge to give it another try Everyone else seems to like it a lot right Plus Mill is right by my school and reasonably inexpensive It would be great if I could eat there Community Kitchen was closed one day when I was really hungry so I came over to Mill instead The first thing I noticed was that in addition to being unfamiliar with the menu there are roughly two things on the menu that are vegetarian friendly namely hot and cold kimchee bibimbap I chose cold randomly and got a bowl of lettuce with kimchee tofu and various vegetables The tofu was pretty good maybe homemade But after a few bites I was struck by the blandness of it all The most interesting part of the meal was the complimentary side dishes of spicy and regular kimchee bean sprouts spicy tofu and tiny fish which I didn t eat I definitely ate more of them than my main dish Unfortunately within a few hours I started feeling sick and could only attribute it to eating a bunch of spicy fermented cabbage on a stomach full of lettuce Mission not accomplished 
-FoGX9kumexiohgSe6qVdQ Columbia This is really just your average bodega but they usually have iced coffee available and it is pretty much the only bodega I ve been to around here where I can shop without getting hit creepily on by the men who work there Once in a while one of the employees at Bahamas will try to get away with it but most of the time they are pretty professional and the owner is always very nice and un creepy Sadly this alone puts it way above the other bodegas in the neighborhood and it s the only one I feel comfortable going into 
-ftConQc_IgSU3bgTdxa4w Columbia It s a problem when you don t even want to try the fresh squeezed OJ The waitress had some sort of rash all over both hands and handled the top of my glass like it was her lover s handles I didn t want to even eat after that but persisted The omelet and accompaniments were on the below average side for diner food 12 for brunch with no booze This is a 2 star spot dropped to a 1 star by fungus hands stroking where my lips should go I didn t take a single sip of that OJ There are better spots No need to try 
-FyOh2XMTlNIJHs8W2EPJw Columbia Pinnacle has good bagels with cream cheese and they are cheap Their pizza is ok The frozen yogurt is good The service is usually okay but be careful because they sometimes try to rip you off on the bread that comes with pasta meals And napkins The best part is that they are open all the time 
-G0Qs29udj7BSvz0bdmb6g Columbia What a great variety Although I never deviate from my usual twice baked potatoe and raspberry crumb cake A tiny bit on the expensive side but not egregiously so 
-gqmPziPENHvA7yvEAi38Q Columbia Tried the lamb burger with the feta cheese and pesto The cheese was Boursin soft and whipped The pesto was not advantageous A medium rare Burger taste and grill texture was not pronounced It reminded me of a burger I would get from Applebees I arrived at opening My waitstaff Sheree was not assertive She was more of an order taker The staff could have been tense since their bosses were present inside Th outdoor patio is well worth it though It started to drizzle and the umbrella was fantastic Six Point on tap is always worth sitting for This bar is very smoothed out conservative and polished Almost to the point of generic The outdoor scene makes up I enjoy meeting Harlem s diversity here That in itself makes the place a winner 
-gV_7f_SLdWtsyPupM5JSQ Columbia This restaurant has the dubious distinction of being the only bad Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at Don t waste your money Steer clear of this place It was so bad I didn t even bring home the leftovers The sauces are bland imitations of what they are supposed to be the veggies seem to have been frozen yuck 
-gYDZQNCtVujkZdRlEluMA Columbia This dog run has been ruined by adolescents including adult age adolescents and their untrained vicious pit bulls One of them attacked a smaller dog one day not sure if the victim survived I do know that the owner of the attack dog was hostile about the whole thing Parks people Police Any chance of retrieving this PUBLIC area from the hood mentality 
-H-v2gs6AMA8eYBoMZg8uw Columbia Nice neighborhood laundry place Angel and the rest of the staff here are very nice and helpful Price range from 2 50 7 for washing machines and 35 cents per 8 minutes for the dryers Bonus that it is near plenty of coffee shops to hang out at while waiting for your wash to be done I will say that I did once bring 4 shirts to get dry cleaned and was told to come the following Tuesday to pick them up When I got there the shirts were not ready they were not even in the building they ship them somewhere else to get cleaned I was annoyed but still return for self service because it is one of the nicer places in the area to do your laundry 
-H96tv8mi-l9Xu8t6E9X2A Columbia Love this place The pizza is AMAZING And not particularly pricey especially considering the quality It can take a while because they are cooked to order but so worth it I daydream about this pizza Order an appetizer and a pizza and that is great for 2 with a little to take home Well under 40 including a drink for each person 
-HCXpKvTBlADbKKA0morjw Columbia independent bookstores seem to be harder to find these days but book culture i believe will withstand the test of time they ve got sharp knowledgable staff who actually deliver customer service in a clean thoughtfully laid out large space A vast diverse collection is the draw here it s in an excellent neighborhood where i can order something online from their website pick it up in the store and then hop down broadway and read my new purchase in a coffee shop 
-hKIQpdfoH7cvyDGB4w8rg Columbia Such Good Breakfast My friend I went here a couple months ago for breakfast and it made our entire day She ordered blueberry pancakes and I ordered the homemade french toast with strawberries I don t really know what hers tasted like because I was too busy demolishing my delicious meal but she said it was fantastic And if it were on the same level as my french toast I have to believe her 
-hlj3gYjYcjBIQ73fV38Zg Columbia There are a bunch of things that I appreciate about Tomo It s tasty both the cooked dishes and the sushi bar dishes It s consistent definitely not the best sushi in New York but I can always rely on Tomo to be satisfied It s fast I ve never had to wait more the 40 minutes for delivery and the service when I ve sat there has been great Overall much better than Cafe Swish across the street and probably the best sushi in the area of its class I love Saji s but that little hole in the wall cheap spot is kind of in a class of its own 
-hlQvzWK8uHy9fAxt8keFA Columbia Great for brunch 
-HYNgTMblR2palBlcaXWWw Columbia Where to begin the food is so so and the service is unbelievably awful I have ordered the same meal 3 times and it has yet to be what I wanted Delivery well they said 20 minutes and a full hour later it was delivered by a guy who didn t have change I can t see them being in business for long 
-HzsxUVID_gptFTSoRz0mQ Columbia I wish I could give it two and a half stars if only because the lunch specials are cheap but involve a huge amount of food but the food isn t that great hence the two star rating The fried rice is mostly miss and never actually tastes fried Today my fried rice had clumps of untouched white rice spread throughout Not so tasty The wonton soup can be kind of tasteless but the chicken with broccoli is good The brown sauce totally covers some of the blandness of the rice Also they give out fortune cookies which makes me happy as the places near my apartment don t do that so lame 
-ifmSpUvvS0q3Jc5vzv0xg Columbia The location is convenient but the sushi is not so good it tastes bland and the crab is fake but at least it s fake fresh crab Not for me though The place itself is cute and the staff is generous and nice 
-IlPMI0I1asgtzYXizqLoQ Columbia its nearness cheapness and speed make it irresistible Columbia but they once sent me a soup that had an industrial size like 4 inch rusty STAPLE floating in it When I called to tell them this they said So don t eat it How s that for great customer service 
-iMASdw11EKfkEoM-gl9jQ Columbia Cheap beer connect four Ms Pac Man darts cool bartender chill vibe a dive bar at its finest Oh and the food is reasonably priced They had a Grilled cheese for 5 50 
-io-ZdLjIE8DdIQXceaeiw Columbia Great little family run business along with the sandwich shop next door Food and drinks are good but you also have to appreciate the fact that the place attracts a lot of characters A Lot Every employee there is either very nice or very interesting which to me isn t a bad set of options Stop by the Hungarian Pastry Shop get a warm croissant or fruit danish with a cup of tea to start the day Not bad at all 
-ItfJrQBXbp2titaSMe98A Columbia The service at Tom s is deplorable I went there with my wife after a long night of drinking to get some greasy diner food I had always wanted to try this place out for two reasons First I live ten blocks away Second I am a fan of Seinfeld Upon arriving my wife went to use the restroom and I ordered a coffee and juice The surly woman they employ for customer dis service approached me and asked to take my order I told her I was waiting on my wife and she left in a huff About a minute later my wife arrived at the table and before she could even set her purse down the server was asking for our order My wife asked for a few minutes and as the gal walked away she said Why dont you just take all day No need for a play by play but it really didnt get any better than that This snarky hag did not receive a dime from me and that was the first time in 26 years I have ever stiffed a server Do yourself a favor Take your picture of the facade and then go eat at any one of the half dozen restaurants within two blocks Were it not for Seinfeld this diner would have been closed ten years ago 
-iynp8jPI4P7Ny2m1Y_2GA Columbia The food was okay I was in a rush and had to wait almost 15 minutes for a sandwich not because of a line but because it took that long to grill chicken I should have ordered a panini from the case 
-IzhO5BLmLyH6bupN9F0sA Columbia Though I would not say it is the best in the city it does stand out for selling novelty size pizza with out loosing out on the taste and hey the prices aren t to expensive Also they make a decent Sicilian slice 
-j0HQpIyfcy1noxNLFLQJw Columbia This needs to be appended merged with the more extensive listing for Taqueria Y La Fonda La Mexicana New York http www yelp com biz taqueria y fonda la mexicana new york 
-j8q-T_dLcUFlkUSv-tPnw Columbia This place is absolutely great Perhaps my favorite place to see modern music I saw Marc Andre Hamelin play Albeniz s Iberia I saw Xenakis Oresteia both were absolutely mindblowing The hall itself is small and quaint cozy with very warm but also flat acoustics the staff are all very helpful the bathrooms are a bit oldfashioned but I will definitely visit this place again and again for such music as Nancarrow and Cage and Adams and Ligeti etc 
-jpcitdBdCrbZ7y99VsXHw Columbia Dear Koronet Thank you for feeding me on those hard to pay rent months You are delicious And after I eat a full slice I always have an inflated sense of self worth Maybe not the BEST pizza in NYC but where else can you get a slice the size of a small child 
-K0AX9ZE72ZzzyKvXhE-jw Columbia Went here because we had some time before getting seated at Dinasaur BBQ I really liked this bar and if I was in the area again I would come back 
-K1AgpLZ9t0k_E2tzyk-Aw Columbia I had eaten food here dozens of times before ever stepping foot in it Back in college I d order about once a week because of their efficient delivery reasonable prices and way above average food for the Morningside area Became addicted to the the steamed dumplings which are a perfect balance of healthy and delicious Maybe the best Pad Thai I ve had in the city Thankfully non of the food is too greasy a common problem for great Thai food and everything looks and tastes fresh Excellent Thai Ice Tea So after god knows how many times ordering in I walked all 10 blocks from my apartment to the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised It has somewhat upscale and modern design great photos on the wall well designed menus and great service More than an acceptable place to take dates and even took my parents there once 
-K6Zth_joMhP3LWp1UtCqw Columbia Always well attended by vendors and patrons with locally grown products and fresh food as all farmer s markets should be I come Thursday AND Sunday every week I can despite the same vendors being there simply for quality and value The winters can leave it plagued with fewer vendors and customers but that s to be expected and I am grateful they continue year round 
-KGUO1Va0VBvZz9zGPy39w Columbia Im by no means a bagel expert but i was quite satisfied with the bagels and cream cheeses here ordered the everything bagel with jalapeno cream cheese toasted One caveat is that this place can get quite crowded Went on a friday at 1030 am line was out the door I guess they are used to it because I only really waited for 15 min Would return to get my bagel fix 
-KpZi5bSc1b9Y6qfh1GRYw Columbia Apple Tree is a big deal When I meet people who used to live in my neighborhood and I want to explain my current location it s the siren I reference first Not near Columbia but around the corner from Apple Tree They ve got everything and then some it s the only place in the neighborhood that reliably stocks Morningstar crumbles the Met supermarket down the street meanwhile is the only place that reliably stocks Morningstar bacon You can take care of your staples here and dress it up with some of the pretty extras they also take care of anyone shopping Kosher The produce selection is uneven but the hummus spice rack fancy cheese selection is a strong They also have all sorts of odd household goods tucked around so if you re in need of a paring knife you can get that Prices are no worse than Morton Williams actually they can be slightly better If you re bargain hunting though walk over to Met Apple Tree recently knocked out a wall the one that used to divide them from the dry cleaner that moved up the block a couple years ago and they ve expanded the deli area There s now a huge amount of space to stand while you wait for your veggie burger or a huge amount of space to maneuver around people waiting for their veggie burgers and today I noticed they ve even added stools and a shelf like counter Apple Tree has been growing steadily for years remember when it wasn t 24 hours me either but it wasn t and I d go so far as to call them a neighborhood fixture In a neighborhood defined by waves of temporary residents that s a big deal 
-KQbDmZDhRE5yt2R0d1Gbw Columbia Bier is a nice indoor beer garden up in Harlem Their food is good especially the brats and the beer selection is good as well I first went last year when my friends who live nearby discovered it The great thing about it being indoors is that it s open in the winter too 
-kuaP6ZacsRU2KcrLOOHyA Columbia The roof deck has been closed for a private party everytime I ve gone here so that s been kinda lame The cheap margaritas from a slushie dispensor is a nice change of pace Its definitely a Columbia hangout spot which is fun if you meet people without their heads up their asses Decent place to watch a game on the tv s A good bar to hit up while bar hopping the area 
-KXkpg_wqcoNVpM5LC602A Columbia What a cute find Reasonably priced wide delivery area and oh so delicious Be advised that if you are far away from their location it will take some time to get to you The first experience I had was in the actual location the place is clean and staff is friendly Very simply decorated but who cares because they have delicious crepes a good size great ingredients and a side of a fresh salad with balsamic vinaigrette YUM 
-LfmhQ72uDNYrZ-pcM2LHA Columbia Nothing to jump up and down about but a perfect addition to this neighborhood Cafe Bagutta has warm friendly service a casual atmosphere and you can t beat the price for the food quality They are super accommodating and deserve more patronage than they seem to be getting Definitely a good place to stop for a casual breakfast before a day of studying in the library Recommend Signature Salad Dinner sized delicious salad with an incredible balsamic reduction for less than 7 Spinach and Goat Cheese Omelet is also delicious 
-Li5VCDxMM7RE_20qfZR0w Columbia I had the potato onion tart appetizer and the salade Nicoise Service was pretty slow portions were small for the price The food tasted good but not exceptionally so I might come back to try the moules frites but with so many other choices nearby it could be a while 
-LjtU0SqTvFVx2XCnO-NhA Columbia Totally not appreciate this shop at all Bad service to stay or to go The dilervery guy shouted at me and my friend because he is not happy about the tip There s another time that we ordered a noodle soup and it tasted sour We are unhappy about the meal and one of the guy told us maybe it s because that we are not used to this flavor You could always get better food around the neighborhood Just can t get it why is this restaurant so fasinated by Columbia s students The only food you can give it a try is the beef noodle soup though it s greasy 
-LMctaLgoWm4Mc3txPbcxg Columbia Their baba ganoush hummus and tabouli are a winning trifecta They are very friendly can some how make whatever you want and are quick 
-m4JibRYy1_64LUZW89SRg Columbia The Yelper below me pretty much nailed it I was gonna give them 4 stars just to be nice but the prices are definitely rip off so that isn t gonna happen But clean and well organized But occasionally rude staff too 
-mDQ9LKnC5FoDqyWlfV3Tg Columbia I love the food here but the delivery service sucks they were very rude which is unfortunate because I love the food 
-Mf10nkmbxHDGxvPbOn9Wg Columbia I m torn It s like a love hate relationship I hate that I need them but love that they re here They really are so convenient great location and they have pretty much everything you ll need But they are so pricey Sooo pricey Before I go I typically spend a few minutes weighing the pros and cons of going here or alllll the way down to Pearl If it s not urgent I ll usually pass on Janoff s Though I d probably need another reason to head down that direction to justify the 5 RT subway ride Sadly more often than not it is urgent In which case like Heather H said thank goodness it s here Some other pros everyone that works here is really nice and helpful because things are pricy here it hinders impulse shopping it s a small store so no trekking up all those stairs at Pearl or spending hours waiting for the elevator 
-Mib_CWMJhscseVJBRhjWw Columbia Really 3 5 stars Perfectly passable Vietnamese Pho Bo was average to good but I thought the broth lacked richness Forget the cow bell more oxtail please Second thought don t worry about that oxtail I m just glad there is a halfway decent Vietnamese place nearby Sushi was so so I can get better for cheaper elsewhere and will However it s nice to have options And the extra half a star is because I hear the delivery is rocket fueled Will have to try that out pretty soon Must be quite a sight 
-mjnJXGiBAdh2iATd7t4ew Columbia Got the beef basil lunch special here Very mediocre spicing and not particularly fresh ingredients And they didn t have chili peppers in fish sauce That s like a diner not having ketchup I ve eaten at the Wondee in Midtown West and was satisfied so this was a big dissapointment 
-moovuJ2KKpBPwjz7KaOww Columbia I may think this place is more awesome than it is because I m in desperate need of anything that reminds me of my beloved Paris and this cafe in fact does remind me of Paris The tables are small and close together The service is bad The food is good All classic French cafe attributes Honestly though I went on a warm evening and sat outside I was hungry and very easy to please The atmosphere was great and the food even better My warm goat cheese salad was delicious and the burgers all looked great The next time I have a desire to run to the airport and book a ticket to Paris I ll just head uptown Its much more credit card friendly 
-n3Czfv1ibCesQ3nVcvofg Columbia I had the pleasure of living in the Barnard dorm above Ollie s one sweltering summer I will never forget the smell of Ramen in the elevator every single day And that s a bad thing It actually makes me slightly shudder to think that I used to eat here when I was too lazy to go elsewhere for Chinese food Unless you get something that has been very very fried you are out of luck The servers always seems overworked and rather miserable It wasn t a huge surprise when the staff filed a lawsuit against the whole Ollie s chain in 2007 for not paying adequate wages see http query nytimes com gst fullpage html res 9402E0DF1130F933A05750C0A9619C8B63 and http www columbiaspectator com 2009 03 23 owner ollie s tomo pays record sum labor dispute The Ollie s near Lincoln Center actually has decent food I have no idea what the hell is going on with this one 
-nk-FxmebI8_rNxpXG3Xvg Columbia When I was a graduate student I had to really search to find a good reasonably priced hair salon Jude and Me is the BEST They offer a student discount 45 for a cut blow dry and now as a regular I pay 55 to have the owner Renee cut my hair Totally worth it Renee is so attentive and knows what hairstyle is most flattering for my face shape and my lifestyle Rarely do I have to give her direction sometimes she modifies my ideas or encourages me to try something new And because I trust her I tell her to go for it I always walk away feeling like a million bucks and there s no pressure to buy products or an expensive treatment Everyone at the salon is fantastic There s a lot of teaching that goes on with new stylists to be to help them develop techniques and experience My first haircut at J M was in 2006 and 5 years later I continue to go out of my way to see Renee definitely a trek from the UES even though I could probably find a new place closer to where I live You will not be disappointed STRONGLY RECOMMEND 
-nsaYNjwVAbhh3dCZKoExg Columbia This is my favorite deli in Midtown They use quality Boarshead meat and give you A LOT more meat than any other deli around They re quick They are also cheaper than any other deli around for what you re getting The bread is fresh the lettuse is finely chopped What more do you want 
-nTzf51qPyrgGy1525CxTg Columbia I really enjoyed this place The food was great and the staff was pleasant I will be a repeat customer the problem with this place is the wait staff not very friendly at all but food is good if your looking for good food you will like it if your looking for good waiters go elsewhere 
-NVjaa9yHbXXFmf0CcjCHQ Columbia This place plays great music First it was the lulling voice of Enya humming softly in the background That was followed by a montage of Simon Garfunkel songs with some Beatles mixed in The music was played at just the right volume not so loud that it is intrusive but loud enough to be audible and appreciated Now the food the menu is a very simple one with no more than 10 15 items There is a prix fixe option for 25 appetizer main course and that s what I ended up getting As I am a seafood fiend I got the escargots for appetizer and shrimp saute as my entree Both were rather excellent and exotic Why 3 stars despite the wonderful music and good food I wasn t a fan of the physical setting The lack of air conditioning on an 85 degree day made the dining experience less than ideal The tables are small and low that combined with relatively high chairs makes it not so comfortable for tall people Also the portions are small and you should be prepared to eat a second dinner 
-nWVeZONypnYWxXB2-knyg Columbia This really is a great bike shop Great attitude toward customers none of the typical bike snobbery you find so often I first went for some bike shoes and ended up with a fantastic new bike No pressure on sales just good helpful advice and a solid selection of bikes Its such a great shop that i bypass 3 others to go here specifically Ask for Jesus on the sales side and all of the mechanics are great and helpful 
-ojB3B80zvZ9vajA4zAAug Columbia The 5 stars are for memories of grad school linked to this place the intellectual ambiance cramming for exams philosophical debates with colleagues the perfect retes strudel cheap dates with starving grad students and the arrogant staff The best cafe in the area always visit whenever I m back home 
-oPieI2A67Q49SoQ874cwA Columbia Really good cookies gigantic though Split it with someone and it s perfect 
-OyprxGr7qzdMbAeVIzAJw Columbia Tasty veggies and salad A good place to eat healthy nice ambiance maybe not the most flavorful in the world though Sat outside which was lovely but our server was ambivalent 
-OYrGRFpX73W8a_0cqCEuw Columbia Pizza Place near Columbia Univ Take Number 1 to 110 its right in front of you when you leave the North exit of 110 street Uptown Regular cheese slice with no toping is like 2 75 used to be 50 cents once upon a time The only point worth mentioning is the size its larger than your HEAD The pizza used to be better but they put too little cheese and too little sauce basically its getting fucked up day by day well anyways worth an experience to eat a slice of cheese pizza thats bigger than your head 1 star for the ingenuity 
-P2wzb-MMEyEgwhLicJ0xg Columbia Doesn t have free Wifi Friendly staff and good espresso though 
-PfUlpAtmTp2sDlhU9Pyxg Columbia I tried to sweet talk the line cook into making me a giant roti it didn t work In spite of my failed efforts I am still a fan of this place It s a cheap tasty meal that you can get until the wee hours of the night The vege fillings are pre made they scoop it out in chunks onto the grill but it tastes wonderful reheated with fresh toppings of tomatoes onions and hot sauce The roti itself is heated over the grill with some oil giving the wrap a nice chewy texture The shrimp is one of my favorite non vege frankies since the fennel and white sauce really complement the shrimp well I ve also enjoyed their fried calamari several times While the overly spiced tentacles aren t actually crispy it s the right level of grease and flavor to cut through a night of heavy lifting drinking I wouldn t come here if you re actually looking for Indian cuisine just as I wouldn t order egg rolls if I wanted Chinese food Roti Roll is a breed of its own and a damn tasty one at that 
-ppOUGkyQcj6pJEr2wjLhw Columbia Guacamole is actually the main reason that I go to Chipotle Sue Y is incorrect the guacamole does not have sour cream in the recipe The recipe is available on Chipotle s website http www chipotle com html food aspx ingredients I gave Chipotle 5 stars at an Indiana location because it s all relative to what the options are in a specific region In New York City one can find many more interesting and delicious places to eat but Chipotle is very convenient for a quick bite of something real and fresh Anti hormone meats etc And a cute non obnoxiously corporate decor 
-PRYqSb9hqM_cxIiUHx9MA Columbia I m a little surprised by the 2 previous reviews I was actually very happy with both the service and the quality of the food I am extremely picky with miso soup and there is only one sushi restaurant that makes it just the way I like it I can now include Vine in that list My boyfriend and I both got the spicy tuna with avocado roll very tasty and my boyfriend got the peanut and avocado roll so good surprising blend but so good the shrimp tempura roll shrimp is his favorite and he loved it and california roll nothing special but still edible We both ordered the watermelon juice which we ve never had before they had a nice list of fresh fruit juices and I ve been dreaming of it since Our waitress was attentive a little hard to understand but attentive nonetheless The restaurant was completely filled and I noticed the guy sitting next to us hadn t had his order taken right away but with a different waitress Who cares though I was happy with my service My boy friend actually said that he felt the waiters were on you a little too much they were too quick One negative some of the tables were right on top of each other I literally sat next to people I didn t know like I was eating with them If in the area we would hit up this place again 
-pUN8NGn9UfjvNWvE_ZsyQ Columbia You know why Jude Me is great Because it is a solid place It s chic enough to make the experience feel like a treat yet it is no frills I personally find that very refreshing As many people have said the price for a hair cut is 50 I think that is reasonable It is easy to book an appointment and they are open on Sunday for all us 9 5 workers It is also relatively easy to find a street parking space on the weekends and evenings For over a year my wife my two best friends and I have been getting our hair cut by Jessica She s talented and takes the time to learn about how you want you hair to look and feel when there is no stylist to do your hair for you Thanks to my experience at Jude Me I have stopped shopping around for a salon That is success in itself 
-PyGfsIL6BT25op4pDC6bA Columbia Not bad friendly waiter lots of room and a good vibe I liked the place Great selection of beers I tried a new one that I had never had before Son of a Peach and loved it 3 stars though for the food It wasn t too expensive it just wasn t all that The chicken wings were borderline gross Fleshy skin no crisp covered in sauce and just looked ghostly and helpless and they never gave us plates to put the bones on so they sat on napkins The bleu cheese dipping sauce tasted sugary and was thin and watery I will go to have beer but maybe save my meal for another place There is also a bathroom attendant in the coed bathrooms which was male when I went and I found it really interesting that this sports bar pub kind of a place would require a bathroom attendant I don t bring cash with me to the bathroom so I got the hairy eyeball from him for not leaving a dollar for him after he handed me a piece of paper towel Come on now 
-Q8Ef9bMhaYg4Q3KEMQbgA Columbia Good time great drink specials Decent sized crowd when I arrived on a Monday night round 1 30am and still a good number of people when we headed out after 3 
-qe4f6vglozw_fI3SlEvMw Columbia I really like this place Compared to some korean restaurants that I ve been to in Koreatown in Manhattan this place is far superior My favorite is the seafood soon dubu so flavorful and contains lots of actual seafood The kimchi pork stir fried is also very good My friend ordered a shrimp fried rice once and it was apparently the best fried rice he has ever eaten Service is mediocre though and like most Korean restaurants I ve been to they ll serve you with the check if they see you re done eating even if you want to sit for a few more minutes and wait for all the yummy food to digest 
-qeZRhtcJLsz8w_n4erkpg Columbia It should basically be called Food for St Luke s employees convenience I can t imagine another reason to purchase food here besides working in the hospital and having a short break which only leaves you enough time to run across the street The food here is blatantly overpriced completely meh and the hotbar s menu hasn t changed in at least a year 
-qlORmmSrINunD2teXFRZg Columbia Great pizza Come here at least a couple of times a month Best pizza in the neighborhood 
-QN6WSe7I8dCXpddGIOBJg Columbia I agree everyone there is nothing fancy here just a pleasant neighborhood place My food was mediocre at best I will most likely never find my way back 
-qnGR75Id2IwFxdPeJSbPA Columbia Great little campus in the middle of the city 
-QOK28A-xWhGSGn7PPJn7Q Columbia I went to Saurin Parke specifically looking for a coffee shop that stays open LATE Lured in by the claim on their site that they re open 7 days per week from 7am until midnight or later depending on the sedentary or lively mood of our clientele I headed off on a weeknight only to be kicked out shortly after 11PM because the place was closing Do they operate on Nova Scotia time Were we the clientele that night too sedentary for their tastes Too lively Who knows The food wasn t bad not a huge selection but tasty hot sandwichy fare and the selection of hot and cold beverages was more than good enough Comfortable seating small but servicable tables and yes free WiFi 
-qoYHN6eY7pe6yMvY1mPOw Columbia Bad food even for that price The only good thing about this place is how quick they make you food which is also a bad thing It is crowded with students all the time and the only reason for this is because it is so close to the law school and law school students are always at the law school Well I guess the other reason is that it is faster than Camille s Bottom line is that most of the food just tastes bad There are a couple of good sandwiches I get including the NYPD I think and the Cubano but I feel bad walking in here most of the time knowing that I have sold out on my taste buds Milano market is much better and located close by 
-r4VBTXPpXQnGdfeCgsrkw Columbia Hooray for Hooda Amidst a flotilla of food stands around the Columbia campus the line that forms here every day at lunch speaks for itself It s the better Halal cart of them all completely equivalent to Amir s http www yelp com biz amirs falafel new york in terms of consistent quality of output but cheaper so win win win 
-RD8b-O_qShbEHl7qccSxw Columbia I was visiting New York from out of down and getting lunch with a friend who works at Columbia She had an hour break and we wanted a place where we could eat and talk until she had to go back to work Tom s should have been our LAST choice We both ordered sandwiches just over Tom s 6 minimum and ate them fairly quickly but felt comfortable lounging around sipping our coffees because there were several empty tables in the restaurant and no line at the door At about the 45 minute mark our server comes over to us and says Are you going to let me earn a living We said What do you mean He told us to leave and let more customers use the table We pointed out that there were several empty tables His reply There weren t before Yes well we were eating before so of course he didn t tell us to get out then Perhaps seeing the problem with his argument he switched tracks telling us You guys barely ordered over the minimum anyway Look I ve been a waiter before so I m not the kind of person who picks fights or always complains about service This guy was just flat out rude I almost asked to speak to his manager but I m just not that confrontational The food by the way was pretty mediocre not worth enduring the waitstaff for I wouldn t go back even if I didn t live three states away 
-RlBGypuqjZw3G9d7yHoPQ Columbia Cooking with local ingredients does not mean great food all the times Brunch at Community Food Juice did not surprise me Blueberry pancakes are better at Kitchenette Uptown some blocks away However the Vietnamese chicken sandwich was really tasty 
-s4b57lFNK6S558etbd3Lw Columbia I m all for the local business in the neighborhood So I popped in to have a bite to eat I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and my friend ordered Chavignon Blanc We patiently waited to be served our drinks 20 minutes the drinks arrived Instead of Pinot Noir I swear it was Asti Spumante That was some straight bull crap in the glass I didn t drink it I asked to speak with the manager of course with out any luck Just a bunch of excuses So I m already over the entire place So I ordered dinner Salmon Bok Choy it was ok I m sorry CHOCOLATE you can t get anymore of my money RATCHET with the old dudes by the door ushering people out for a private party Nice space need NEW MANAGER one who actually not ducking from his patrons become better verse with your wine selection WE ALL DON T DRINK HENNEY 1 Star for DECOR 
-sdUuCI38DCBdIcenaWeIA Columbia These are the best bagels in town if you like them not crispy on the outside They do not keep long so it s best to eat them right away I remember when the price was 50 cents bagel not too long ago and now it s a 1 But they still taste great 
-sIFGGLXALSiqX1UdUF_bQ Columbia I grew up in the South Most Northern restaurants screw up Southern recipes by trying to upgrade them from their usual tasty simplicity Make My Cake keeps things simple and gets them right This is not to say that simple things can t have complex flavors note They ve got a Red Velvet Cake that s just just faints It s that good In the best RV cakes you shouldn t taste the chocolate and you can t here it s perfectly mingled with flavors of buttermilk and vanilla Comes in cupcake or sliced layer form with or without pecans I think the icing was cream cheese but I m not sure was too busy trying not to eat my own fingers while I wolfed it down If you go here for nothing else EAT THE RED VELVET CAKE They ve got a German Chocolate Cake that kicks ass too though not with the traditional caramel pecan coconut icing I hoped for Their chocolate icing was pretty good though They ve got pie too what looked like Lemon Icebox and Sweet Potato though I didn t try those They ve even got comfort food like plain Yellow Layer Cake a la Duncan Hines Sometimes you just want the kind of cake you grew up on not some pastry chef s twelve layer filo and marzipan masterpiece Go downtown if you want the weird fancy shit come here if you want just good cake I also like the atmosphere of the place it was clean and bright but there was a real down home feel to it There are tables and chairs but they didn t seem to be used much when I was there most people came in got their cake and carried it home to have their food orgasms in private I think I will come back sometime and have a sit down although the pervasive aroma of cake will probably cause me to go buck wild and eat a half dozen slices at once and go into diabetic shock right there on the floor But what a way to go 
-sPqRMdZbjjpr66b1-mVUA Columbia I went here for Valentine s Day two years ago Not the most romantic place per se but memorable and actually quite beautiful in that solemn we re all going to die kind of way There isn t a whole lot to see some Grant war memorabilia flags other fun American relics I wouldn t plan on spending more than an hour hour and a half here What makes this worth the trip is the mausoleum itself From the outside it looks like a typical 19th century building dome columns marble But inside it feels much grander regal You realize that this is a pretty big deal for just one dude The openness of the structure makes for great acoustics and a welcome expectation of quietness among patrons within the tomb The near silence lends the experience a distinct gravitas Standing opposite my then bf diametrically across the large hole in the center of the building beneath the dome I could hear even the slightest of movements breaths Whispers traveled like shouts It was fun One of the better Valentine s Days I can remember RIP General Grant 
-sR8Fow7NA_Q0mjFvkdcww Columbia Tons of MSG in the food even more than most Chinese take out places If you want to take an instant nap after eating order Panda I ordered the Garlic Shrimp combo that included shrimp pork fried rice and veggies They throw in those crunchy Chinese snacks and an eggroll I also got the won ton soup which was below average It came out to be 10 bucks Pretty quick and tasty stuff except it ll knock you out 
-SSCt0V84ukRcIaoR9-t8Q Columbia Found a speck of who knows what in my wine A bug A food particle from the person who last drank from that wine glass that the dish washer didn t properly clean Who knows Either way nasty Food is wholly mediocre to bad The only upside was the pleasant waitress 
-SZI3Po-aodeujpY_6DgxQ Columbia Amazing service atmosphere and food Plus cheap food Love love love Caroline is not only a beautiful hotty but awesome 
-t-Vcpk9uhJFJtz6wxTH5g Columbia Ahhh memories of Columbia University toga parties with the rugby team Blackhaus nights Beer pong and the essential visit to Koronet Pizza at the end of the night The size is incredible it s the biggest slice I have ever seen in my life possibly equivalent to 2 3 normal slices But a slice was always SO perfect at least to me at 3am wrapped in a bedsheet fake ID in tow 
-T-zeXXjGeklqPAM1WQh-Q Columbia been back several time since the last review and happy to report the cashiers said thank you each time saw one of the managers outside and he acknowledged the problem he said he saw my review and others on yelp and said they were working on it 
-tO3JRbjPpHM9uMJDGFFmQ Columbia This place is awesome Despite how I think that SoHa is one of the more ridiculous words to be used to describe a neighborhood the food here is great Prices are reasonable the pasta is fresh and sauce is great Wait time is not too bad either even though it tends to be busy all the time I don t mind the small space i think it just adds to the cozy atmosphere it seems to be going for My friend also managed to finagle a cup or something from one of the waiters which was nice My one gripe is that they only accept cash but that is not a huge deal 
-TronVbtuST9AR7o7jNXMg Columbia I ve been a completely loyal customer to Saji s for the past 4 years for one main reason good food at a decent price Despite the slight increase in prices over this past year I blame it on the new cashier computer thing and other such improvements Saji s has competitive prices that are hard to come by in NYC especially when you re living in the UWS The food generally is incredible and definitely satiates any Japanese food craving I have usually for salmon or oyako dons The only time I am disappointed which has probably only happened twice is when they skimp on the crunchy panko part of my crunchy spicy salmon tuna which I pretty much get every time unless I m in a particularly ravenous mood in which case I get the oyako don I m grateful for the hole in a wall nature of this place because that s probably what helps keep the prices low They ve tried to expand their menu recently which I feel iffy about The ramen is only okay which was disappointing because I had intense cravings for ramen and had such high hopes for Saji s because of the quality of the other food If you re going for a pick up I would definitely recommend calling in advance maybe when you re 10 15 minutes away perhaps earlier during peak hours just to make sure that the wait time is minimized since they get incredibly busy 
-TTJYzLyrrtvHXwUGyzIgQ Columbia A late night staple for Columbia students Koronet uses all the gimmicks it can get for customers to enjoy its somewhat mediocre pizza The size of the pizza yes it is mind boggling can be daunting at first but it s not too hard to eat a slice or two if you ve got the appetite The only problem is whether or not you d want to The pizza tastes a bit like cardboard at times and doesn t have too much flavor For just a bit over 3 it s not a bad deal The place is open really late into the evening and is popular with students clearing out of the bars as it s one of the only places to eat nearby If there were other choices Koronet just might not be so special 
-TXamqOd07Cb1--_rh_6Wg Columbia My friend and I were extremely cheap so we chose this place on Orbitz It was horrid the inside of the room looked like Charlie s apartment from It s Always Sunny in Philadelphia so it was basically a shit hole The bathrooms were even worse the elevator looked haunted and our room door didn t completely close shut also our window was facing some dude s apartment where he walked around in his black speedo and half shirt We certainly got what we paid for I guess the star is for the decent neighborhood we were in 
-Txik2wIEvKS1qI6wLMUUw Columbia I was really excited when this place opened up in my neighborhood but the time I went there was only so so The restaurant interior is cool and modern The pizza was a bit overpriced for the portions and the crust was bland The waiter went on and on about how thin it was and it was basically a cracker I ve had plenty of delicious thin pizza try Keste in the East Village but this doesn t qualify It was a bit disappointing 
-U1s44aBHbDYbOubZm1IZg Columbia OK my friends ADORE this place and it seems like a lot of people here love it here too but my first visit here was sooooooo average It s a really cute cozy place I was excited to decide on my dish I liked how it was a relatively small menu which usually implies more care and thought from the kitchen I finally decided on the fettucine with mushrooms in truffle oil after my friend raved about their homemade fettucine Well I was truly disappointed It was pretty much a bottomless bowl of mushrooms doused in oil with a side of fettucine After a few bites I thought to myself Wait really Am I eating a bowl of oily mushrooms I thought this was a pasta dish For 14 a big disappointment However my friends got spaghetti pomodoro 7 95 and truffled eggs 12 95 which were both SO much better Really great and flavorful So it looks like I ordered the wrong dish for my taste Hopefully I ll come back and next time I ll have something I like 
-u3J_-FzmlqDChpNXAMsuQ Columbia I feel bad writing a negative review for a small business but here it is I only got take out from Jesus Taco once I thought it was the worst Mexican food I ve ever had and my girlfriend thought it was the worst food she s ever had period It was cold where it should have been hot flavorless fell apart and overall disgusting All of their food and ingredients seemed lousy We ve both had Mexican from a lot of places including delivery and it was never like this I m not sure if we had bad luck and it just happened to be a bad night at the kitchen or if delivery food from them is always worse than eat in or what might have happened but our delivery that night was awful I hope for their sake that Jesus Taco either improves their food or that our experience was a fluke But I would never get food from there again If you re close enough a Mexican restaurant nearby I would recommend is Taqueria y Fonda which is almost always perfect and has never been disgusting like Jesus Taco They deliver too 
-u5PGDKpnusM3c1iE9MqzA Columbia I came into this location St Luke s has several buildings they use for different areas of medicine For an outpatient meeting after the surgery I recently had to remove a growth from my scalp The doctor was quick and I had no issues with the waiting period 
-u7sgGhI7Vwx24wDRin0Ig Columbia Fun place in the summer when they have the doors open but it s just too noisy otherwise They ve got to do something about the acoustics Great food and beers though and a nice change of scenery in the neighborhood 
-U7wJXw6LLOHYDV6SRTg1w Columbia Everything is authentic here and most of everything is amazing The chicken is perfect moist succulent and well but not over seasoned The flan is the best I have ever had The only drawback is that some items apparently are not homemade like the fried cod which with sometimes has an ice cube inside Still this is much better than the local El Malecon and arguably better than the Bronx location 
-u9dGNThIl8pDY5pOjnKkQ Columbia Oh no did the quality food fall off to match the attitude of the hostesses yes I walked here for brunch last Saturday with my bf and we both ordered the Eggs Benedict and I was not impressed This is the same meal that I have every time I come for brunch but what happened did the chef have a bad day 
-uh1CW814z42GiqyntTNvw Columbia Mediocre pan Asian food They ve also screwed up delivery orders The only reason I go there at all and gave them two stars is because they do decent bubble tea and carry Lady M s crepe cake Otherwise I wouldn t set foot in the place 
-Ui8LDJvluiGssxTzzimjA Columbia I don t know why JJ dining hall got such negative reviews Their food was more than edible Yes it s not as good as say Cornell dining hall but it gets us through just fine The brunch was pretty good There s a variety of waffles cereals salad bar fruits drinks etc I loved the chocolate soy milk But I guess it s too pricey for their quality Was it 14 without meal plans I will also complain about the to go sandwich box it was horribleeee Cheap cold sandwich with a bag of chips and cookies for 14 dollars Anyway overall it is an acceptable dining hall 
-UUCigObd8qrD3SmrfkeTQ Columbia The lamb is delicious here The portions might seem small but then you just keep eating and eating the injera fills you up quickly Try a glass of honey wine The honey tastes very subtle but it s perfect Also the kategna appetizer was delicious Basically it s toasted fried injera with spices A bit greasy but it will wake up your taste buds This places gets super crowded so try to call ahead for reservations My only complaint is that I wish their spicy dishes would be even spicier 
-UZBNZgDeY0GefHEYddwXw Columbia My mother used to bring me and my brother here to have an egg bagel with cream cheese which is so rich it can simply full you up I went there in the morning of independence day and the line was out the door but the waiting time was very reasonable I shared a bagel with my brother that had lox cream cheese smoked salmon tomatoes and onions It cost 9 dollars but it was worth every penny They give generous fillings you won t find a bite that doesn t have cream cheese I also like to take out a dozen of bagels and get one for free Put them in the freezer and they still taste great after they re toasted Once I went there at 4pm and and didn t have to wait at all 
-V3Rm0bcbpt1Ikh0SOz_DQ Columbia Strangely whenever I visit friends who study at Columbia I have lunch with them at Vine Although Vine s food is average in general it grills eggplant well I also likes its papaya smoothie If you want a quick lunch at Morning Heights Vine would be a decent choice Food 2 Decor 2 Service 3 
-V9C28pJU9Xw4Sk5ikbozA Columbia I ve been to Chocolat many times and had great experiences but this last time makes me question whether I will return again I m a busy mom of two so it s been a couple weeks since my experience but I really need the owner managers to know that what I experienced is not acceptable I went there for lunch on a TUESDAY a couple weeks ago with a girlfriend I had my twins in tow and she had her son with her All three children a under a year old so they are definitely NOT partaking in the food at this restaurant Despite this when we received our bill we were shocked to discover that gratuity had already been included b c we were a large party Seriously We sat at a table for two and had our strollers on either side of the table and the infants did not have anything to eat so why we re we charged the automatic gratuity My friend and I couldn t help but chuckle b c the18 they charged was less than our standard 20 tip but the gall of them to charge two women a group rate makes me question returning any time soon 
-VA14lnwj9bA9mwlf6zt1Q Columbia I popped in here with some friends after having some dinner and drinks across the street at The Smith We wanted to continue our drinking and it was conveniently located The place is pretty large by New York standards but even with the extra space the place was packed to the rafters with people It made getting to the bar to order drinks pretty damn difficult We ordered one round of drinks which were average priced and decided we didn t want to deal with the crowd anymore and we wanted a change of scenery so we moved on 
-vOD3m5z07zY8zCxncYyKA Columbia It is hard to imagine a more mediocre American diner The food is very unremarkable I ve had a few different dishes always rather greasy and bland It seems they do not need to make an extra effort to make great food because there is a constant flow of Seinfeld tourists regardless of the quality of food One thing that really puts me off this diner is the insistence with which they try to push you out of the restaurant as soon as you re finished eating I was calmly drinking coffee with my friend for 5 minutes after the meal and they asked us to please leave because other people werw waiting I found that really rude However the prices are pretty good especially for the Columbia area 
-vpduOM_NK5AfTW0l-ySZQ Columbia Mediocre sushi at its best I think it s pretty good for the price but I don t really get much pleasure out of eating mediocre sushi If you re going to eat sushi eat good sushi If not order a pizza The vegetable tempura is delicious The spicy roll combo was disappointing It wasn t gross the way bad sushi can be but it was warm and the fish tasted a little tiny bit less than fresh You re not going to get sick from this place but it s also not much better than what you get at Westside Market or Whole Foods 
-vrl5xwhSThB5GRpVdUr0w Columbia I think i should have liked this place It was crowded on a friday night there was a mix of all types of people they had lots of beer They had lots playing on the TV lots of TVs but in the end my group all just kinda congregated and kept asking what are we doing here and my group was so mixed with different types of people that at least someone should have been happy none of the 8 of us were we were distracted by some craziness including a middle aged man with a group of girls who seemed to make their IDs with looseleaf paper and crayons and some girl coming and secretly taking a picture of my brother yeah that was awkward but they had lots of beer and shot stuff going on after awhile the circus was distracting and we left happily 
-VtAo2xJ0hGTac7DJFvaTQ Columbia Just moved to the neighborhood and ate here for the first time I was excited by the brunch menu and the atmosphere was cozy upon arrival They were prompt to bring our coffee and water and were easy going about substituting fruit for salad potatoes My date and I were in no hurry so we didn t inquire when 20 minutes had passed without any sign of our meals We ordered a crepe with cheese avocado and bacon and a french toast plate with 2 eggs and sausage Another 20 minutes went by with no food but plenty of coffee refills We finally got our food and it was relatively well prepared although the ingredients weren t very evenly dispersed throughout the crepe wads of cheese and gobs of avocado facing off across a mountain range of chopped bacon About 1 4 way through our meal a woman stood up and inquired loudly across the counter about why she had been waiting 45 minutes for her breakfast food The owner manager was quick to respond and here s where things got interesting He checked the woman s order ticket and corrected her she had only been waiting 41 minutes and her food was now ready She explained that she had eaten there before and experienced a similar unreasonable wait although that was due to her order ticket falling from the queue and being forgotten The cook interjected to say that he remembered the ticket falling incident and that they compensated the customer with free dessert The customer retorted that she had paid for her dessert at her last visit and was simply inquiring as to the delay a question we had seriously considered asking after 40 minutes The owner began raising his voice to the customer and trying to convince her that the wait was perfectly reasonable as they were busy all the tables were indeed full and there were about 20 customers She said that he was being rude and his customer service technique was good ol reliable rubber and glue the customer was being rude by asking She pointed out that 2 gentlemen who had arrived after her were already eating The quick witted cook leapt to the rescue by asking the customer in a classically condescending fashion how many people are in their party 2 how many people are in your party 3 The owner took that opportunity to remind the young woman that he had been the owner manager for 7 years and he knew what he was doing At this point our meal was essentially ruined and I was reminded of eating dinner at a table while my parents argued over nothing A simply apology by the owner would ve really smoothed things over but he couldn t bring himself to it The young woman and her two friends decided that they were ready to leave and began packing up She proceeded to offer to pay and the big shot owner said no no of course not Wait until your food is ready and then walk out he chided She informed him that she frequented the place but would not be back and the owner projecting his voice across the restaurant said that he didn t need her business and offered her the meal to go in a desperate sarcastic fashion The young woman declined and went over to her waitress at the register she had previously said that the specific waitress was a friend of hers The young woman quietly tipped her waitress friend and started to say that she was sorry but she wouldn t be returning after how she was treated by the owner Meanwhile the owner 4 feet away began trying to INTIMIDATE the customer asking why she was talking to the waitress when he was right there for her to talk to the woman s 2 friends a couple with their baby had already walked out to wait outside He came over behind the waitress and loomed over the counter She said that she was done talking to him and was saying goodbye to her friend and he accused her of trying to talk about him while he was right there She got fed up and just turned and walked out Every patron at every table watched on in agony as the owner demonstrated just how tactless he could be while setting a sterling example of a failure in customer service ungracious unwilling to listen and generally agitated The waiters and busboys looked on in agony as if this wasn t the first time the owner had virtually engaged in an altercation with the customer I considered telling him that I couldn t enjoy my meal in the wake of the argument which took a bare minimum of 5 minutes to play out but I wasn t in the mood to test this guy as he had gotten pretty huffy and for all I know was ready to snap We paid and tipped our waiter but I can t be emphatic enough in this rambling review I know I m griping that you should not give this guy your business Atrocious morning and I m still in a bad mood 4 hours later I thank anyone who read through all that My summary The food is fine the menu is fine the waitstaff is pleasant and the atmosphere is fine as long as the owner keeps his mouth shut He doesn t care about your business Stay away 
-VTu6tEeQlNlli3ViBQ6ZQ Columbia Drs Obernesser and Pomerantz continue to show consistently exemplary care for my cat going out of their way to check in on him calling every other day after his latest procedure and making life as easy for me as it possibly could be when a sick animal is involved They have been more than fair about billing both explaining why certain tests are necessary and being willing to omit other less essential ones due to my budgetary constraints The cat had to be hospitalized for several days and the only thing that kept me from going crazy from worrying about him and feeling guilty for leaving him alone in a strange place was knowing how wonderful the whole Uptown Vets staff is and how much they truly care about their patients My cat is now back home on the mend and in as good of spirits as ever thanks to this fabulous vet 
-W5lo9Y2JmWBCzwsL4lCuA Columbia Chocolat is in soft launch which means full menu but no alcohol They won t even let you bring a bottle of wine like Frizzante did when they opened but say that their license is only a few weeks away That being said the food was pretty good I particularly enjoyed the sesame calamari which was actually large enough to be an entree The house salad was good and large but nothing you couldn t do at home with a bag of mixed greens The flat iron steak special was well prepared and accompanied by potato puree and asparagus The the snapper however while incredibly tasty was overcooked I will go back when I can pair a drink with my meal but probably not often as the prices are steep compared to the other excellent restaurants in the area 
-Watxu-JkajaWzyo24BzBg Columbia Oxtail delish shrimp mofongo pure perfection and mojitos are one of the best one in the city Brunch menu is well put together aND staff is super attemptive 
-Wc9iEPNBF-N7M0kwDXmrw Columbia Ok first off seriously nobody calls it the hamdel I have been coming here for over 5 years since I have to work in the area The sandwiches are ok The drink prices are a bit extreme and the selection could be better The best thing about this place is the burgers Oh my God are they even real They are so good The people that work here are very friendly and they do a good job of getting your order out to you quickly Generally a good place to stop anytime when you get the munchies 
-WeZzw4kkgE-lx9D0lJrNA Columbia Don t go if you are hungry I have been to the Harlem Tavern 4x yes that many and with the exception of 1 visit it was quite bad I went to Harlem Tavern for brunch 1x and for dinner 3x My three bad visits were all to blame on the lackluster service and food I had to wait for water 10mins and my drinks to arrive 25 mins the part that is annoying is that it appears to me that the bartenders are not that busy On one occasion after being seated for 45 minutes the waitress had my appetizer and main course come out together sigh Another time after 25 minutes of waiting seated my waiter forgot to actually place our order my drinks appetizer and main dish He then asked us to repeat everything we ordered AGAIN because he forgot The table next to mine was a family where the parents received their entree ate it but their children s dishes didn t arrive until the parents were done Here are some notes about HT Atmosphere Great location with ample seating for all couples large groups and families with young children The entire restaurant has flat screen tv s throughout and on occasion a live dj and a jazz band pretty cool Food Awesome beer selection if that s your thing The other drinks are so so I ve ordered the Amish chicken dish which is great but I wish there was consistency sometimes the creamy polenta is not so creamy The lamb burger was excellent at brunch but at dinner the following times it was eh Don t get the french onion soup I think they make it with beer it was pretty bad so bad it had to be returned Dessert menu is basically nonexistent which is bad for a dessert gal like me I usually just take a little stroll to Make My Cake for a cupcake Service The staff is obviously inexperienced They all need training in how to 1 remember an order ie writing it down on a piece of paper vs trying to remember 2 Placing the order into the system correctly 3 Spacing the order so that my appetizer doesn t come out with my entree mmmkkk Location Perfect location and is easily accessible by car and train I ve tried to call management but they never called me back I guess you can say that s typical So you may ask why do I keep going back if its so bad Because the food is not that bad and I actually have low expectations for bar food seating is always available without a reservation or wait its so easy to get to and the atmosphere I m not sure how long that will last though I hope this review helps you

-x9UUZd_kz5bEyr6_8ro2w Columbia Yummy and healthy Great biscuits strong coffee A bit loud in main room cafeteria style but there s a small back room that is better for conversation I had eggs with this chicken apple sausage it was pretty tasty Its crowded seemingly all of the time as there is the Columbia Upper West crowd Organic fresh ingredients make me want to go back Service was pretty good

-xdxm5LUjW3RSkV-U1pFdg Columbia I lost my cell phone and was feeling pretty lousy about having to go out and get a new one because of my carelessness but I walked in here was helped immediately and the guy who rang me up and set up the new phone did it quickly and answered all of my questions His name is Carlos Super nice and helpful and I will totally go back here for my next phone in the future hopefully not because I lose this one I m not sure what the earlier reviewer was talking about when they referred to a bad smell This location has always been clean and I have lived here for years 
-xMICid1DOUk_O5cmNrgIg Columbia You re here either because you want to be in Max SoHa and they don t have room for you so you re waiting for a table and dreaming of gnocchi or you re here because there is a gee dee dearth of comfortable coffee shops on Amsterdam Ave which is ridonks consids how many fricking people there are nearby who just want a place to put a book out and write in it or on it or about it Anyway that s why you re here If you do buy something like say a salad it has like four bits of lettuce and it costs 8 If you buy a crostini or a panini or a ini it s cheaper and tastier If you buy coffee you re not me because I don t buy coffee And at least there are lots of different chairs and things and mostly you can sit there for hour nursing your 8 three pieces of lettuce and ignoring the staff well actually they took to ignoring you first You could do better but not a whole lot better I mean at least you re not at Fresh 
-xNGgMHMc5rrmsyiT3nnyA Columbia This was awful I hated every minute of my experience there I had egg drop soup Funny thing is they forgot the flavor I also shared an order of pan fried pork dumplings I d say they forgot the flavor on this too except the parts of the wonton which they burnt definitely had some unpleasant flavor For an entree I had some noodles a wide noodle sauteed with some beef They were greasy and lacked any seasoning I should have sent everything back and left but I was hungry and it was late at night This place is always packed and so I thought it would be good Now I just want to know why the hell so many people are there all the time Surely they aren t there for the food 
-XRLUr4WSwEMjnJ3cdirrA Columbia This is a great NYC bookstore It s small but that hasn t seemed to hinder selection When they do not have something readily in stock they are happy to order and the order comes quickly Only had one instance where they could not order the book I wanted but I m not sure of why Overall a great place to shop for books outside of the megastore environment 
-xWW0iZoHo7Vs0f39NO_8g Columbia My friend is a Seinfeld fan and so the opportunity to eat at the diner that served as the outside for Monk s on Seinfeld felt like a nice treat We walked in and were seated I had a regular breakfast of eggs sausage and toast My friend had a bagel with lox There are also photos of the Seinfeld cast up on the walls So what did I think It s just standard fare diner nothing that really stood out The main draw for this place is that it has a link to Seinfeld so people will come just to check it out Wait staff is decent Of course the younger gals are more engaging but that s about it It s close to Columbia University so you can always stroll over there afterwards Other than that nothing too special about this place 
-xxJRyBMJCygtCMuVfhmEA Columbia We ordered a large pizza at 6 30pm Granted it was during the Super Bowl and the person we spoke with over the phone we couldn t access the site presumably due to the increased traffic told us it could take up to 1 5 hrs We started calling again around 9pm We either got a busy signal or no one picked up Finally we were able to reach someone around 10 30pm a full 4 hours after our order They told us the pizza had not yet been made I understand that demand must be crazy during the Super Bowl But it s also not a surprise In my opinion they should have 1 Gauged the number of orders and not taken our order 2 If they only realized after our order was placed that they wouldn t be able to deliver on it to call We had an email confirmation as well as a phone confirmation and of course thought it was coming 3 At least issued us an apology when we called at 10 30pm and the pizza had not even been made At the very least there is a serious logistical problem combined with sub par customer service There are many other options in the neighborhood so this is likely the last time we ll order from them 
-YF9X-9Cc0zAb1yWcL1flA Columbia Mill Korean has something for everyone Carnivores vegetarians vegans and people like me who just eat fish and vegetables Also its atmosphere is informal and comfortable Mill Korean serves you lots of small appetizer vegetable dishes hotly spiced with more nuances than just kimchi I highly recommend the oe bi bim bap even if I may be spelling it wrong It s raw fish with an abundance of vegetables and rice I ve also gone there with people who love beef and all of them have loved the multiple options for beef at this restaurant the beef being cooked in a Korean style As a plus they are not hesitant to make your dish vegetarian or vegan if you ask I really recommend this place 
-Yh6fdRVRz3K4lbSh09uJg Columbia Probably the best Mexican in the area those so called authentic ones don t seem too authentic who puts mozzarella cheese in a taco Anyhoo I like the Havanna Chicken Burrito and Quesadilla Those Bulldogs Margarita and Corona in one are good but they ll get you in trouble and maybe a headache careful 
-yHN7hxWmoCFMK5W7-PcWQ Columbia 3 5 stars I can only review their breakfast sandwiches The line was quite long but they are very efficient in getting you through taking your order and paying while they make your sandwich I went with the simple bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel The bagels here were better than I expected but not the best in the area The sandwich was quite good and filling I ll definitely be back to try their regular sandwiches or one of there flavored cream cheeses Solid place

-z8K96EXKFn5_fly8hOdVg Columbia I love this place It s amazing to have that kind of outdoor space in the neighborhood and the food is really tasty Sure nothing on the menu is especially fancy but they get the basics right and it s reasonably priced I had the sausage plate which was really delicious I was a little annoyed at how long it took for the food to arrive but our waiter Christian he s fabulous was attentive and entertaining throughout The beer list could be better for a place that bills itself as a tavern but it s certainly a wider selection than anywhere else in the neighborhood although Bier probably has a smaller higher quality selection I will definitely be there again and again 
-zFreEYso8KVCHbcIg7QDg Columbia I really tried to look past the negative reviews and try this place out anyway The service was very spotty My group and I ordered drinks and the drinks sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes before the waiter decided to bring the drinks over The waiters were more concerned with make convo among themselves than attending to the patrons I ordered the crab and lobster dish and disliked greatly I had the waiter take it back and went with the burger and fries instead and that was OK i could have made abbter one at home smh The fries were actually good I really liked the ambiance there very mellow and nice decor I would go back but only for drinks no dinner Sorry Chocolat you dont get my vote

-_IxBhT-35dPc2MUTLJkMg Columbia Those who know me well know that I when I have a crazy idea it must come to completion If I come up with something exiting I must do it or else I ll fixate all week Yes I am aware that I am bat shit crazy Let it be known to Yelpers that I have the healthy kidney 10K and the Brooklyn half coming up so every weekend I do one slower endurance run between 8 13 miles Usually I will do this run with Rita E She helps keep me motivated and we always have fun laughing and gabbing the whole way She is on vacation for 2 5 weeks so my motivation has dropped considerably Why run when you have nice herbal therapy at home and cold gluten free beer in the fridge So basically until Rita gets home i have to come up with my own motivation to run I calculated that running from my apartment in Brooklyn to Harlem would be about 11 miles and what better excuse to gorge myself on chicken and waffles If I am going to cheat on gluten I better go out hard So thus going back to the idea on fixation I had the idea the whole last week that I would run to Harlem to eat soul food I remembered seeing the Throwdown w Bobby Flay episode where he gets spanked in the chicken and waffles competition by a little place by the name of Melba s Melba s would be a 10 5 mile run away which was perfect for my long run I told Josh H that if he met me I would pay for his dinner He obliged and thus our visit I arrived in the restaurant a sweaty mess I profusely apologized for my disheveled appearance The woman at the bar was Melba herself and she told me not to worry at all I explained that I ran from Brooklyn and she promptly sat me down at the bar and poured me a much needed glass of water She was engaging and so sweet She even let me sit at a table while I waited for Josh A waiter promptly came over and told me that he heard I ran there We chatted about running for a while and he told me that Melba the owner was so impressed that they wanted to give me a free drink on the house Talk about awesome service I ordered a delicious Pinot Noir Josh came soon after and we both had fried chicken on the brain He got the combo plate and ordered mac and cheese and collards as his sides I went with the fried chicken and eggnog waffles with a side order of sauteed spinach to keep the semblance of healthy living We LOVED the food Like fuck me I want to marry you loved the food The eggnog waffle was one of the best things I have ever eaten and was well worth the gluten hangover This was one of the best ideas I have come up with in a while Service was prompt and so nice Josh and I wound up tipping 30 percent just because we felt so welcome Why not 5 stars Josh and I kept on waking up in the middle of the night to drink water Methinks that the brine they used on the chicken was so salty that we became dehydrated The food didn t taste salty but often times you find that extra sodium creeping up on you in the brine I don t mind extra Na Cl but not when I need to drink numerous cups of water in the middle of the night to maintain homeostasis Despite this we had an amazing dining experience and I would happily return

0-9EqXApMtztfe_b_ChYbA Columbia I can t believe I m writing a positive review of this place When it first popped up a bubble tea place across the street from pink berry and not as close to campus as other bubble tea options I thought it was doomed to fail quickly I passed by daily wondering who thought this could be a good idea I was angry that they were wasting a perfectly good store front in the Columbia food wasteland that could have been used for what I really want to see near Columbia a good ramen place like Naruto perhaps Finally yesterday I decided I had to go in and find out what is up I walked in smugly expecting the place to suck The interior is awkwardly spacious for a place in Manhattan It feels like they should be offering more there and just haven t figured out what or how The options were confusing and it took me a while to figure it out while also taking the couple behind me even longer hopefully that means I wasn t the only one Eventually I asked the guy behind the counter what he suggested oolong milk tea cold So I tried it And the rest is a beautiful blur It was absolutely 100 delicious I m actually anxious to go back If they were open earlier in the morning they don t open until 11am I would stop by regularly on my way to work and treat this as my new go to morning caffeine fix Now I actually hope this place can figure itself out and find where it fits into the neighborhood They have foods they can warm up for you in the microwave as lunch options and asian pastries too but I m still crossing my fingers that they will expand to offer just a few more food types I still am not convinced that this place won t crumble like so many other restaurants recently have in the area but now at least I hope that it doesn t

0-cvBjERazfUo54740BAPQ Columbia This place was AWFUL I went with a group of friends after visiting Columbia The food was crappy psuedo traditional Chinese and the service was horrendous I had the wonton soup noodles with roasted pork The broth was both extremely bland and very greasy The wontons and the roast pork were pretty flavorless The actual waiter who served us was very nice until it came time to pay the bill He very nicely told us that they couldn t split the check We were trying to figure out how to divide the bill when a female staff member maybe a manager came over and started waving the bill in our faces and yelling at us about how we couldn t split the bill I ended up putting it all on my card After we purposely left a shitty tip she actually followed us out of the restaurant onto Broadway and demanded an explanation We told her we didn t tip servers who were as unpleasant and mean as she had been She started yelling at us again and told us not to ever come back Terrible terrible experience Expensive sub par food insane staff I ll stick to Chinatown for good noodles 
0-oK0qelwpdwdb9-71PHow Columbia Did the waffle propose to the chicken or vice versa Do you suppose the food priest said the following Chicken do you take waffle to be your plate partner until teeth do you part Both chicken and waffle agree Strawberry butter is exchanged I now pronounce you a delicious food pairing you may now be drenched in syrup This was my first ever chicken and waffles experience and it really gets about 3 4 stars Both chicken and waffle but both just seemed to have been a bit on the drier side That strawberry butter was something else tasting freshly of strawberries more so than butter I actually liked taking bites of just the waffle with that and syrup and bites of just the fried chicken and hot sauce sorry it s the Korean in me I went with a group of five on Saturday at about 12 40ish and we were happy to have no wait The waiter did get upset with us since we paid with 4 cards I was a server once it really is annoying I know this beat Bobby Flay in Throwdown but I m convinced there may be better chicken and waffle marriages elsewhere Got suggestions Send them 
0-VI-dhOYNOh4Y5p3L2Azg Columbia 2 5 maybe a three Went for happy hour and then back again at 10pm for karaoke on a Sunday night The first bartender was so friendly as well as the guy running the karaoke But I received completely rude service from the new bartender after the guys changed shifts Totally disappointing cause drinks were on me that night and boy do I hate interacting with rude people I d really like to go back for the karaoke but hate rude service its a toss up Either way it wasn t crowded at all and our group didn t have to wait too long for our songs 
003yF0TCaarkAT5Zmhkmrg Columbia These bagels are without a doubt the best in NYC I really believe that what distinguishes Absolute from other bagel shops is that this family operated shop makes its bagels with love You don t get warmth and hearth like this without really loving and believing in what you do Bagels are always fresh Cream cheeses are flavorful with only the best ingredients Even beverage selection is complete with a full panel of Honest Teas OJs great coffee and Thai Iced Tea I m moving out of NYC soon and will definitely be missing Absolute Bagels more than anything 
00f0wbN_hziAEdw45GFMJA Columbia I bought a danish to go It was fine 
00FGaERZweaVngOE7DcEUQ Columbia Arguably the best pizza in New York City Nothing fancy at all about it in fact it s pretty cheap Way cheaper than other shops in the Columbia MSM JTS area Perhaps it s a bit of a hike for your average student but they deliver pretty far and there are no better pizza options in the area 
00SxM3WfNTurq8zux1u2Iw Columbia A healthy layer of melted cheese can correct a lot of culinary faults but not at Jesus Taco There s something distgusting about the sauces they use that no amount of cheese can cover up The staff are pretty clueless they got our order wrong but gladly corrected it adding some extra cheese for good measure The price is right but the food is nasty it probably explains why Jesus Taco is a perrenial favorite of the neighborhood stoners 
00szsg8vQy6yX5f-m9sI4A Columbia This place is a great neighborhood bar I ve been there twice once with a large group and once with a couple buddies and this place is great for either They have great deals on weekdays such 3 draft beers and shots And not just one type of light beer or anything we re talking quality stuff here Brooklyn Ale Yeungleng Blue Moon Stella etc They have a dart board pool table and a couple of tvs Really great booths along the right side perfect for you and a couple of friends With a group head to the back where you ll find a projection screen usually showing a sporting event and a kind of secluded VIP area with low couches and a coffee table Really great place and I m definitely going back 
00VlVgGDScXwijRzFvvV8Q Columbia Beautiful atmosphere when I walked in Friendly staff great service and the brunch was excellent Will definitely become my new regular brunch spot If you are thinking about going here don t think just do it You won t regret 
01kdu-jwm1M0b4IvmJ_tKg Columbia By no means do I qualify myself as a Thai expert but this place has a great atmosphere with quality food and pricing comparable to other Thai places in the neighborhood Service was a little slow but since we went at the peak of the dinner hour on a Friday night that was probably why I ll be adding this to my places to eat when we have out of town company over 
01RZS5ddVgNq_LIXODyNQA Columbia I have come to this place several times I must share with you the plain crepe with sugar butter is out of this world deliciously simply phenomenal please try it and tell me what you think However I had to deduct a star for service which is slow and absent minded Also for the one time I came here and they were short staffed and ran out of eggs That was just strange but they assured that was only a one time occurrence due to the holiday I hope they learn to run across the street for more eggs if that ever happens again duh But it s all worth it for that plain crepe Mmmm 
01SnyKH8R9YVjQvx5HYHYA Columbia i just moved to harlem and have a good feeling that i ll be frequenting this relatively new addition to the neighborhood the vibe is a bit more packed noisy than i usually enjoy but the music is great and the crowd is extremely friendly my brother and i spent a good half hour talking to the guy next to us about technology and dealing with his rebellious teenage daughter it should be noted that neither of us have kids which we readily volunteered at the start of the conversation before he began seeking advice the menu is pretty diverse and delicious every time i ve gone i ve had a very hard time settling on what to order the trio of sausages starter is obviously a must but from there it becomes much trickier i ve had a couple of their burgers and a pulled pork sandwich that i can honestly say is much better than its more famous neighbor 9 blocks to the north and a couple blocks west excited to try the flatbreads but now that i ve had the pulled pork i may never stray from that beer selection is pretty solid although not breathtaking and this is probably my only beef with the place heavy on IPAs and hefeweizens not so heavy on porters stouts or lagers that said i can definitely live with the options and they ve got a fairly solid bourbon selection which helps to compensate 
02ji5sevxe86Ay9JN5sB1A Columbia Mmmmmm brunch I should start off by saying that this is only for brunch However it was so good that we went Saturday and Sunday morning the first weekend I tried Campo I may need to frequently pause during this review to wipe up my drool Day 1 we did all breakfast selections and day 2 we ordered just about everything The goat cheese omelet is phenomenal the breakfast risotto should not be missed and the french toast was worth the walk in the pouring rain Yes I eat off my friend s plates so please one go out to dinner with me if you like to share Day 2 we got LOADS of the truffle fries two of the pizzas a burger some breakfast foods and calamari Our crowd grew on day 2 but we could have finished all that with a day 1 crowd It was all SO GOOD There is nothing I can t recommend I ve purposely been holding out on the best part UNLIMITED BLOODY MARYS OR MIMOSAS FOR 10 New Yorkers are damn spoiled Being from the land of one price drinks damn you Boston this was a HUGE treat for me My 1pm buzz and the people I entertained in Central Park afterward most certainly appreciated it Alright I m going to need to go back to New York ASAP 
03DJ2AO6G_KGdZZTxn4c0w Columbia Got the lumberjack with scrambled eggs and blueberry pancakes Good food and big portions The burger I got via delivery was not so good though It can be really hard to find a table on the weekend because it gets quite Crowded The atmosphere is family friendly and a typical dinner like decur 
03tesrfRR3iAfCMUST8EJA Columbia First a word about some of the negative reviews on this place posted by the ignorant Its obvious reading some of the comments that many of the detractors of this place have never had authentic Italian style pizza in their lives So if you ARE a fan of authentic Italian style pizza where the quality and simplicity of the ingredients are allowed to sing then you ll love Bettolona s pizza because its very good If however you are a fan of quantity over quality and prefer 12 toppings and fake mozzarella then stick with Papa John s and don t bother I have yet to dine in the restaurant itself though the pictures look nice so I cannot comment on the staff service or ambiance but we ve ordered from them half a dozen times now and the food has been excellent The pizza is really good the pasta is really good and the salads are good too I ve tried half the menu now and been quite impressed its not flashy its not trying to be anything avant garde its just simple delicious classic Italian recipes that are well executed and consistent The only thing I would caution with delivery is that if you order on a weekend they ll get busy and your food may arrive lukewarm So for delivery order on a weeknight for the best quality and fast delivery 
03t_4FU1Fl6bjBjh7ND0-w Columbia What a great addition to Harlem Friendly and casual atmosphere Wonderfully tasteful pizzas and a price that s not too bad It s my new go to for pizza in the SoHa 
03xaK0tjVEdpb_fni1WSOw Columbia Food overall is delicious Service depends on the day and time of day that you come Weekday brunch I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries Delicious Waitress was really friendly and available Saturday Brunch before 12 Busy as ever slower service but to be fair they only had 1 waitress serving I had the Eggs Florentine delicious Portions are great Coffee was great Saturday Brunch after 12 Not as busy therefore waitresses were a lot more available Had the friendliest hostess waitresses ever I had the Three Egg Omelette with choice of 2 fillings Delicious The bits of bacon were huge two thumbs up Would have preferred more home fries Side Note They were more than accommodating My friend asked for hot chocolate which they didn t have but the waitress was nice enough to whip something else up instead 
03XrKGsXhL14P2OBzJ6AEg Columbia Crepes on columbus is overpriced and there is always a wait However I consistantly return for their Oeuf Columbus On wonderfully cooked ratatoille they place a potato and goat cheese cake a thick latke and two poached eggs The cake is to die for Not being much of a fan of poached eggs I always ask for two cakes and they happily oblige I always wished the ratatoille be on a crepe but that may be carbo overload for even me They also have build your own crepe options and non crepe items Everything is normal sized portions it can get you full and are well made Nothing mind blowing in my opinion besides the aforementioned Oeuf Columbus However if you even have a small party expect to wait on the weekend There is a quick turn around but also a long line With free wifi a TV and a nice wait staff a less busy weekday would be the perfect study work location too bad everyone doesnt have the schedule of a student 
04mOzwFdeVfeaNQQYuvq_Q Columbia 2 drink min really you cant beat that 3 shows no cover charge and free complimentary appetizers come on and the bartenders are AWESOME GOOD SERVICE GREAT LAUGHS GREAT TIME 
04qXtbphnUzMx-VnfcO2lQ Columbia Not very contemporary or fashionable I went to another salon for a corrective cut after getting one here If you re looking for a trim on long hair this is fine but not for anything super fashionable or stylish 
04UZvgIavrLAKKpyBD8YwQ Columbia This place is all around good but nothing more than that The coffee was good and my croissant sandwich with cheddar bacon and scrambled egg was also good The service seemed a little burnt out on the job and just wasn t very friendly The young woman working the counter just seemed like the last thing she wanted to be doing was working there understandable in the service industry on a Sunday She definitely let it show though by making me feel like every question I had was taxing on her and I didn t see her even give a fake smile the entire time I was there The food was good the service was O K and I liked the ambiance but it was definitely a crowded area with one too many tables for the size of the seating area Overall I would go back there if I was close and wanted some coffee and breakfast but other than that I wouldn t go out of my way to go back here I also would not go there with a group of more than 3 people considering they only had one cook and 2 people working the counter one primarily making espresso drinks when they get hit with a rush things are gonna take a while to come out 
04_x9tDrQzYGjQ7MctajeA Columbia Wow I love my soon to be neighborhood Everything about it has really impressed me thusfar and Melba s is no exception What a BEAUTIFUL restaurant As I was sitting there amongst fellow yelpers I took a moment to envision me and all my friends dining and laughing and enjoying good food and good company I had already eaten across the street but I browsed the dessert menu and went for my first slice of Red Velvet Cake It was indeed red It was certainly velvety And quite rich A little sweeter than what I desired but all the same quite enjoyable I was sitting next to Hugo O And when his Po Boy Sandwich came he offered me some fries I wasn t going to take one and then he gently insisted And Well THOSE ARE SOME GOOD FRIES Golden brown crispy seasoned to perfection with a little kick at the end Mmmm The wait staff was slow with getting our order and slow with bringing the check Guess they wanted us to stay a bit longer Southern hospitality I suppose Surprisingly reasonable for the atmosphere as far as prices are concerned And the background music was really good I can t wait to go back 
0574_RJamZSkx4q-eFadkQ Columbia What a gimmick The art of coffee eh Tasted like coffee to me Definitely NOT worth the 30 minutes I waited in line literally But I ll admit it was good coffee probably better than average and definitely better than Starbucks but honestly the wait kills it especially if you re trying to go on your way to class 
05KZrRKUbHfYzeiH-N7BQg Columbia Julie was extremely fast friendly but didn t chit chat and cut my hair just as I asked Space was small but inviting Chic but not trying too hard They didn t try and sell me products I didn t need Once I go there a time or two more to confirm this experience wasn t a fluke I will bump it up another star Student Discount is nice too UPDATE Julie is still the bomb she gets 5 stars However I quickly grew tired of their decor and and I don t get the student discount anymore my fault not theirs So no extra star Yelp needs to add a half star option 
05RCUM4rUFZ3byLavRWAPw Columbia My wife and I are new to the neighborhood and I have been here several times for brunch lunch and dinner once The service is excellent the wine selection is solid and the food is very good I think the price point is more than appropriate It is low mid range to affordable for NY and I have certainly been to quite a few places in NY where the food was more expensive and not as good Yes maybe it is a bit higher than the average food option for the area but get used to it this strip of Harlem is becoming quite the hot spot and higher prices relative to what the area used to be tend to come along with that just look at the real estate It s usually crowded I m a fan and I can t wait until they get outdoor seating 
066mfcVrwb8Hr05baw-uDw Columbia only had wine here there were no seats left at the bar and all the lounge seating area was taken so we stood and had wine the vibe is really cool here love to see black people just hanging and chilling out and having discussions with friends and just having a good time the food looked awesome here and smelled great i will try it next time its small but i did not feel crowded just a really cool spot and i would definitely come back 
06c656okq23R-wf8F_S9ug Columbia Wonderful cozy restaurant The owner is awesome and friendly and pretty much does everything himself alongside a few waiters waitresses The service is slow but by that I mean he actually takes the time to cook it and prepare it like good food is supposed to be cooked and prepared My meal was delicious I had the special which from my memory was some sort of chicken unfortunately I can t quite remember exactly what it was Regardless it was delicious The whole place is an excellent spot for somebody looking to spend a relaxing few hours with friends or a significant other while enjoying awesome food We ordered a dessert which was plums with yogurt and it was amazing He brought out another dessert on the house which was peaches and cream Again amazing I highly recommend La Belle I will definitely be going back 
06rOPhDQIyPYCzHWJ1z0nA Columbia Where would you go if you are a student in Columbia and want a few cheap drinks West end This place is hop skip and jump from Columbia and has been a host to many law school parties We were regulars there during law school It has a private room at the back which can hold a decent group of people This was our personal fav We almost blew up their music system during one of our events They have a lot of happy hour specials and they used to serve American food but apparently the management has changed now and they serve a lot of mexican food But their food has always been pretty good All you fellow columbians school is not the same without a west end experience Esp when all you need to do is cross the street to your dorm when you are tipsy 
06vinJvVITtV42SNafyDEw Columbia This place is ok yes everything is super fresh but it s always crowded and over priced and the menu isn t that diverse 
07-kizxlPgbkxKP5WV5N9w Columbia I had high hopes for Pisticci and their version of orechiette broccoli rabe sausage but the pasta was overcooked For a small intimate Italian restaurant you d think they would have pasta down to a science but a perusal of yelp reviews seems to indicate otherwise R had high hopes for her grilled shrimp salad special as well another Italian restaurant standard but it was underdressed and there was more red onion than all the greenery combined We had reasonable expectations given their four star yelp rating and we were let down 
079qZoLbp97Aa6ET7dcysg Columbia i love best yet about as much as it s possible to love a grocery store huge selection great meat and produce departments and friendly employees in every department as a huge beer nerd beer world on the second floor is what originally lured me into the store and for my first couple of visits what kept me coming back i ve yet to give a thorough perusal of the bottle selection because i never make it past the growler station a great selection of draft beers from all regions of the country at an extremely fair ahem way too low price of 9 99 plus a 3 deposit for late adapters purchasing a growler for the first time minus one star only because the wait at the check out lines as others have noted can be eternal strange because no other part of the store is ever very crowded also they don t seem to stock mole sauce despite an otherwise great goya selection which is deflating 
07OcBvs-Vli0DYGO0oA8kw Columbia CASH ONLY what it s really too loud in there there s absolutely nothing to absorb the sound also writing beer on the wall in different languages meh i could see where the paint ran which resembled bloody feces maybe that s more of a personal problem the beer list is not large enough for myself and its overwhelmingly more german than anything else i hear the neighborhood s lacking in a lot of nice hangouts so i m sure this is welcome but they need to try harder our server was pretty swell 
08ES16p-HDY7NCWMvXXYLQ Columbia The pastry is pretty good the coffee decent the service serviceable Every now and then the academic posturing and faux sophisticates get interrupted by a deranged transient cursing and spitting nails but most of the time this is a nice quiet place to catch up on the paper or paperwork 
08lKHQRX0qEb5jukQ18Diw Columbia I really enjoyed Vine I went to try it last night for the first time since it changed from Swish or whatever it was called The boyfriend and I had a lovely time at Vine The ambiance was calm and the music wasn t too loud The sushi was really quite wonderful too We tried three house special rolls after having the miso soup and some pork gyoza The miso was pleasantly miso y The pork gyoza could have used a little more zing but they were good And the sushi was yummy The spicy tuna had a kick without being too spicy or too rich with mayo The tempura shrimp in one of the rolls was still crispy and well cooked I don t do sake but it looked like a good selection We had a really nice experience Will definitely go back before I move 
08_lw94785UN7FBuEZ2g0w Columbia The Take out Yes here on Yelp is inaccurate even during Snack hour and a half during said snack hour and early brunch CU students get 10 off with ID they scrutinized mine like a reverse bouncer Sat at the bar on the unwieldy stools which were uncomfortable but nice folks The farmer s chop was nothing special but did boast fresh ingredients and a hearty crunch Everything was saturated in dressing which overwhelmed the dish a bit but a solid albeit 10 purchase PS Clinton St Baking Co folks run the jizzy joint 
09jAs6yha5B8Cvy6lXz60Q Columbia I m really surprised by such bad reviews for Indian Cafe My friend and I order delivery every week or two weeks and I think it s delicious Maybe dining halls have lowered the standards of our taste palettes but I think their chicken saag is really quite yummy It s always usually cooked perfectly so it s never dry and always juicy and plump My friend gets either the chicken tikka masala or the chicken vindaloo The vindaloo is way too spicy for me but the tikka masala is pretty good Their naan is also good warm and soft even for delivery They only give us one carton of rice though which is enough for us but it doesn t seem like very much for two orders The one time we went there and ate the atmosphere was very nice and the service was good We got one of their specials some mango chicken curry and it was to die for Every time we call to order now we ask to see if they have it no luck yet though 
09mVzRdKOqJctovpn6dLWg Columbia There are too many bad things I can say about this place I ve never had Korean BBQ before and this was a great first experience We came here based on the recommendations of two people we randomly met Ordered the BBQ platter with chicken short ribs beef and pork Everything was great The beef was better than 99 of the restaurants I ve eaten at at this caliber Pork was flavorful and chicken was spicy but not too spicy Shared a premium 10 bottle of sake with my wife We couldn t finish all of the food so it was definitely great quality and quantity for the 60 we spent The spots in K town have a high bar to reach now that I ve experienced this little nugget in the UWS Short of 5 stars because the menus weren t clean and had food in them 
09qdTBdbbtN0q26LW8REkg Columbia Yes this is yet ANOTHER review about pancakes Came here because I had a strong craving and this place is very reasonably priced I got the strawberry pancakes and although they were super fluffy and very tasty the server was in a huge rush and messed up my order quite a bit First the pancakes came without the strawberries so he took my pancakes away and brought them back with four strawberries on top Then he completely forgot to bring the sausage side order I asked for He was very apologetic which I appreciated but when a woman s got a craving for pancakes and sausage there is very little room for mistakes The coffee was also not up to my diner standards Over all though a very good place to come for breakfast when you re on a budget and have been watching Seinfeld for the past two weeks 
0a-Y5uAr7HJ1sIjhv-gBUA Columbia This is one of the most beautiful and stunning churches I ve ever been too A few years ago a friend of mine got super sick an was in St Luke s just a few blocks up I came inside because I honestly wanted to pray The stain glass is wonderful It s super clean and this church has a long history here It s massive in size and the decor will make your jaw drop They also hold a lot of events here which is great for the community of Morningside Heights 
0aurk48nC6magwGMQo630Q Columbia Such a great addition to a up and coming neighborhood This store had just opened the last time I was home and it is such a great thing for a wine drinker like me It s just a block and a half from my apt and could be cause for many more drunken nights entertaining friends is that such a bad thing Didn t think so With a reasonable selection of wines most at very reasonable prices this should be a place that any wine drinker in the area should stop by I will most definitely be back whenever I m home Drink wine 
0bdpY9ZLKyEQUr8jqQ7btg Columbia I ve ordered take out several times and the girl sitting behind the cash register is rude unfriendly and has an attitude I never feel like going back but I do because this is the only Chinese restaurant in the area I m so ashamed I found out that the owner had to pay out 2 3 million in back wages in 2009 to 813 workers in many of his restaurants in what the State Labor Department called the largest amount ever collected in a single case of minimum wage and overtime violations I assume that is why the employees are so unhappy http www nytimes com 2009 03 19 nyregion 19ollies html The food here is not great It is the only Chinese restaurant by Columbia University on Broadway The lunch specials are not worth buying because the main course comes in the smallest containers I ve ever seen I wouldn t order here based on the fact that this place is a sweat shop 
0BEdnNa6wpdeh8DfA4hMzQ Columbia We ordered delivery so I cant judge ambiance This is for the pizza only While the pizza had good toppings and had a thin crust It does not compare to the traditional NY pizza in that it is NOT made in a brick oven Therefore the crust is not the same Like someone else mentioned The crust is thin but the middle is soggy Also the crust itself is lacking in flavor The toppings however make up for this lapse The pizzas are SMALL compared to the price My bf was upset when he saw the size after paying almost 20 and getting a personal size pizza This is NOT acceptable Especially considering that you can go to the best brick oven pizzas in NY and they cost about the same price for a LARGE pizza that can fill 3 people easily This pizza was meant for ONE not even two people Although I wouldnt write them off completely They need to improve their crust size and cost to compete with the best NY pizza joints They do have the advantage of not having much competition in the area but they are OTHER places where we can get pizza 
0bFfTLq6S-20HV3u7CBmVw Columbia This is one of my favorite spots for affordable sushi delicious la sa ga and la sa tom and sake that hits the spot The Boy and I used to come here often when we were students at Columbia at first because it was only ten minutes away but then because we loved the food prices and waitstaff so much The la sa ga here is my proverbial chicken soup my go to on days when I m feeling crummy and need some liquid penicillin There s something about coconut milk a hint of chili oil thick chunks of chicken cellophane noodles and bean sprouts that can make any illness go away Another favorite is the three roll sushi combo which comes with hearty portions for a spartan price and always leaves me feeling just a little too full D 
0bGk5BkfHESW4ctsRi6-1w Columbia Certainly pricey for the area and tries to be more than it really is but friendly service solid grub Got the 12 50 Blackened Striped Bass sandwich on a soft brioche roll with pickles lettuce tomato r moulade Cheese was extra and no sides were included so for an UUWS lunch that s pushing it B1018 no starters were below 8 75 NOTE Happy hour from 5 7 along with Sip a couple doors down 
0BHjzSHgPDkCL9Aqd914dA Columbia Officially my favorite Cuban spot in the city Upon walking in you feel like you were transported to someone s home Dim lights classic wooden tables floor to ceiling doors and windows that are sometimes left open on nice nights There is also a live band that plays and people will randomly get up and begin to dance The service can be a little slow but you get past that once you realize how nice the entire staff is You have a choice of sparkling or tap water The empanadas are out of this world and you can get the sampler which offers three different options The mojitos are nice and STRONG I m not normally a mojito girl but let me tell you theirs are good Very good in fact We each had the shrimp mofango Amazing Plantains mashed into pork and shrimp with extra shrimp lying around your plate It looks tiny but it s extremely filling The dessert looked good too but we were completely full after our meal Slightly pricey but worth it if you ask me 
0bnBKYBQaKesrJyU3VDPAg Columbia Terrible food and quite pricy Just bad 
0bqD3Cdz1bs1bFwBNk-xJA Columbia For a cheap Chinese take out this is as good as it gets Wai Lee was a great companion for most of my undergrad career Its certainly comfort food And the delivery was always fast even in rain and snow 
0BQT4pvJMstDUCcCcSrKSA Columbia Very cozy and charming place I love the live jazz on Thursday nights and it is a perfect spot for a date The bartenders are very cool and nice to chat if you wish Decoration is classy simple but the place has always been a delight to go 
0BwTTpLFh75qBe0nA5Qa-Q Columbia Maybe it was the heat Maybe it was 4 per taco it costs for a small taco Maybe it was the tiny tables too tiny for not such cheap food And I know this sounds petty but it was definitely the fact that you couldn t mix and match your two tacos for 8 50 they had to be the same flavor I know other reviewers loved the early luchador style but I was not as impressed Having said that the food wasn t bad so the third star for that But because of the relative expense and small cramped tables I am not running back 
0BwXT1VPSrTIj9HlEN2tow Columbia College students mean bad restaurants in general Especially at elite schools they have more money than taste and places that cater to them can do fine while serving garbage Case in point this place Obviously you shouldn t order a salad they re inedible but even the bar food staples here have a whole lot of fail What IS that stuff they serve with the wings mayonnaise cut with Elmers Glue and flavored with PAM Certainly you would not want to put it in your mouth 
0BxvAYgKd2k6J5kKGohjpQ Columbia I eat here all the time and am rarely disappointed I always get the Mi Xao Don which is kind of like Hong Kong style chow mein stir fried meat and veggies in a gravy sauce over crispy fried egg noodles It s always pretty good extra points for the lotus root The egg and spring rolls are very good as well Can t speak to the quality of their Japanese stuff They re also always very fast when you order delivery 
0C9yTwKNrb_qTT_7mNQfaQ Columbia Community is owned by the same people as Clinton St Baking Co however the quality of the food served here does not compare at all I ve been here a few times mostly for brunch since I think that s kind of their forte I ve had the blueberry pancakes veggie scramble and smoked salmon benedict all of which are similar to some of the menu items at their original LES post The blueberry pancakes are served almost exactly like the downtown location with warm maple butter but the consistency and flavor of the pancakes are very much different I find the pancakes served here to be much less fluffy and tender and somewhat lacking in the amount of wild maine blueberries they actually put in the batter The veggie scramble and benedict are also just standards not unlike what you d find at most American restaurants The whole wheat biscuit served here also pales in comparison to the ones at Clinton St a bit tough and too crumbly for my liking Community may be a good option for Morningside Heights especially for fresh American fare However if you want to experience the famous blueberry pancakes by Neil Kleinberg and his wife and partner make the trip downtown 
0Ckfd2yFZ9sukd8Sc8owkw Columbia great chocolate rugelagh 
0CSkmWE4ZZUsAb-ONVbvQw Columbia Miss Mamie Spoonbread of the Uptown New York Spoonbreads dishes out BBQ and soul food in this homey establishment that requires a cartographer and a city planner to determine whether it s in Morningside Heights Manhattan Valley or Harlem This is more of a family neighborhood joint than say Dinosaur BBQ so save this for a quiet lunch dinner and not a night out Summary verdict is to stick w the soul food and shy away from the bbq Recommend the fried chicken sweet potatoes and sweet tea Longer version below Following Yelper advice I ordered the sampler platter and a sweet tea on my first visit This got me a pork rib a beef rib a fried chicken drumstick a piece of fried catfish and three sides Here s what I thought Fried Chicken Artery cloggingly delicious Not a food I crave much but much more satisfying to eat a piece of fried chicken vs a bland chicken tender or a reconstituted chicken nugget Worthy of ordering as an entree but make sure your co pilot orders something different lest the plane go down when you both go into a coma upon ingestion Pork Rib A lot of meat but the sauce was too heavy and sweet for me and the rib meat was tough Worth eating as part of the sampler or off a friend s rack but I wouldn t order it as my main dish Beef Rib Meaty and moist but equally satisfying and satisfactory I would ve preferred a tangy BBQ sauce over the gravy that was smothered on top Fried Catfish Quite light for a fried fish Accompanied by lemon and tartar sauce I liked it but it felt like Southern Fish Chips minus the chips Not that I don t like Fish Chips but it felt out of place with the other samples Sweet Potatoes Fantastic Brown sugar rests on top of the sweet potatoes and liquifies to the point where it becomes like a syrup Must order Mac Cheese Solid Lighter than I thought it would be The cheese is dried vs molten I d get it again but wouldn t come just for it Black Eyed Peas More like Fergie s face less like Fergie s body Collard Greens Delivered by mistake instead of sweet potatoes which thankfully they corrected These are an acquired taste that I ve yet to acquire Sweet Tea Awesome My sweet tea experience is mostly limited to crappy fountain sweet tea found in Popeye s or the Daisy May s version What I liked best about this one is the mint flavor is more pronounced than the sweetness Makes it more refreshing Red Velvet Cake They didn t charge me for the slice as I ordered it after the bill came I found it to be ok After having this and a few Red Velvet Cupcakes around town color me ambivalent to red velvet unless you re using it for an Elvis painting Service Pleasant Slow Mildly incompetent didn t fill my water even after asking collard greens instead of sweet potatoes 
0cUhotYOh2tb3x4TjmyLOg Columbia Good beer selection very friendly staff above average bar food After work and weekends it s often hard to find room for more than two people but overall it s one of my favorite local bars 
0DDm3JGO6eyCG-0_bVwGNw Columbia I like Ethiopian food largely because it s spicy enough to penetrate my dead smoker s tastebuds But I have a shameful secret about eating at Zoma The whole time I just wanted a damn fork Homo habilis started using tools like 50 000 years ago specifically to avoid getting woolly mammoth juice on his nice velociraptor pelt or whatever I m not a trained paleontologist So why do this homo gotta use bread to pick up unwieldy chunks of meat sauce Zoma is a yummy mess Probably not good for a first date unless you re into some kinky shit P S You have to order the honey wine It s a perfectly sweet balance to the spicy food 
0DF_ca-LhcL6PTCoyUh8lg Columbia Ate here with my wife and a colleague for lunch While we didn t specifically look to eat African food on this day It was more a It s really windy and cold and everywhere else is closed sort of decision I m glad we decided to stumble into this particular place My colleague and I ordered the monkfish and lamb respectively and shared off of one platter using bread to make mini wraps with specific items My wife had sambusa a dish similar to an indian samosa The food took a bit longer than usual to come out however it was worth the wait The bread served was super spongy that allowed it to soak up the various sauces in each mini dish The spicy lamb was spicy but not overbearing and the spongy bread had a slightly sour taste to it not unpleasant but unexpected Overall I d say it s a must see if you want to experience a different dining experience than most restaurants in the area A good choice for lunch as well the place may be small but wasn t too packed when we were there at 12 30 
0dioEfPrMOmmag6I-PSlOg Columbia Came here with my dad when we were checking out Columbia University and the beer was amazing My dad ordered us each a 32oz with a shot of whiskey he wanted to celebrate me being accepted I guess haha Also the roasted chicken was WAY better than I had expected it to be which is always a nice surprise I will definitely check this place out again for the food but ESPECIALLY THE DRINKS 
0DrH2c7C3OY8tdTkj4WO_g Columbia Fairly nice decor i usually judge an Ethiopian restaurant on it s art displayed amongst a few other things of course and there is certainly some nice stuff here The food is fairly good I am going to give it 4 stars overall because the food is not horrid I would give the food a 3 5 really the service is always nice and they ve always had Harar when I ve been there which is a damn good beer I do wish that I could give it 3 5 though I d lay down a 3 here but I just feel like it deserves a wee bit more so I am going to be gracious Oh yes If someone ever sees a place where you can buy Harar in a store let me know My friend in New Mexico would love to have some mailed to her and I would love to have my refrigerator fully stocked with it 
0dva6w2in0pJMwg4zgpHWQ Columbia Underaged college kids check Barely enough room to breath check A line to get in This isn t a club check Flimsy plastic cups check Cheap drinks check Loud top 40s music check What more can you ask from a college bar The view is pretty nice if you are one of the lucky ones that can get a spot next to the window 
0dvG0s55EVrKUnM6bS-LRQ Columbia ugh i love pinkberry s froyo but this place has literally no where to sit the tiny store front is always crammed with people and there s barely any space to move also the line usually goes by pretty slow froyo deserves 5 stars tho 
0dXEwHkue1FEJrxD_F2cJA Columbia I ve probably given one star here just for the nostalgia factor Since I went to Columbia in the late 80s this place will always feel like The West End to me I tried Havana Central for lunch today and found it to be average decent but not special It s good to have some options though I worked in the neighborhood for 7 years and found myself at Floridita 3 times a week Sad I had the special Seafood Salpicon salad It had shrimp mussels clams scallops octopus etc with olives tomato on a bed of greens The seafood seemed fresh and flavors were good For dessert we had churros which were warm and tasty The cafe con leche Adequate If you re in the neighborhood it s a fine lunch option if not probably not worth a trip to the UWS 
0E9Y_hiZ038M_XMFye04_g Columbia It was packed tonight w costumed freaks getting their eat on before the parade of ghouls St John the Divine Figured out what I wanted just by looking at the food passing by as we waited so when we snagged a table I was ready I had the smothered chicken w mashed potatoes and collards while my friends had the Friday fish specials w 3 sides instead of 2 Smothered chicken was suitably smothered in a gravy that struck of one note salt It wasn t over salted or salty but there wasn t any other flavor to the gravy But who cares this is smothered chicken so a gravy made out of pan drippings isn t gonna taste like much more than whatever they season the breading with The mashed is mashed and the collards were suitably smoky w a little heat and a not overwhelming amount of acid Washed it all down w the lemonade which was refreshing Skipped dessert cuz we were stuffed but I ll be back for more 
0ERY2HvLhTCEQlaNzdSQDA Columbia Good chinese food kiddy corner to the entrance of Columbia University Always packed with students Great amount of food for your buck 
0EsG6WWzp8y0uBDVXLj7Ow Columbia I had a great brunch at Kitchenette yesterday and I highly recommend the place I had a smoked mozzarella and artichoke omelet with roasted red pepper pesto and a biscuit the dish comes with grits or other sides but that was more than enough food for me the only bad thing about this place is how hard it is to choose what you want to order i would definitely come back with a bigger appetite and dig into some of the delicious sounding dishes on the griddle menu like vanilla bean french toast or pumpkin pancakes even though it s way out of the way for me I m planning to go back soon 
0euqQQQA1OHZFUFrNNsWtg Columbia Nestled on the corner of 108th street and broadway is one of my favorite wine and liquor stores Now it might be on the small side but the service at Martin Brothers is anything but Their friendly staff is always ready and willing to help you pick that perfect bottle of wine and often have samples and tastings along with great sales I always leave happy and with one or six bottles of something 
0EwXOk_Pf-JXrC0gx0q9-A Columbia I love chocolate What girl doesn t But this was the first time chocolate deceived me Talk about judging a book by its cover I stumbled upon this place after coming out of a nearby museum exhibition opening Originally my friend and I attempted to dine at the restaurant across the street but were turned away since they were about to close They pointed us across the street I saw the sign Chocolat and my eyes got big and I danced a happy little jig I was so hungry that I didn t check Yelp for reviews mistake 1 As other reviewers have noted I sooo wanted to love this place It was a Wednesday night around 9 30ish so there was no wait that was a plus Ambience was nice Marvin Gaye s Sexual Healing was playing sweet another plus But my giddiness soon came to a screeching halt It started with the wine The waiter super nice guy wasn t well versed with the wine list I ordered a bottle of Riesling and he insisted it was from Africa Hmmm I m not a wine snob but c mon man Rieslings are mainly German good ones that is France turns out a decent Riesling even Australia but Africa Pftt After he realized he was wrong he comes back to deliver the news that they were out of Riesling and brings me a Moscoto My friend isn t a heavy drinker so I went with it But it wasn t till I saw the bill later that I realized the waiter failed to mention that the Moscoto was 17 more than the original bottle I ordered That s a negative in my book buddy Not to mention the Moscoto sucked Almost 50 for a sucky Moscoto is not cool On to the food I ordered from the appetizer menu Baby Back Ribs 14 kinda steep for an app in my opinion with a side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes The ribs were just OK a bit on the fatty side The mashed potatoes were cold and chunky and did not have the slightest hint of garlic to them The waiter noticed my dismay and took my dish back to the chef for an added dose of garlic and a quick nuke in the microwave I presume It tasted a tad bit better but needless to say I didn t eat much more All in all a very disappointing meal My friend ordered the Shrimp Grits the most expensive dish on the menu at 26 I saw that he was struggling to swallow even a few bites I m not a grits kind of gal so I can t judge fairly but from what I tasted it was just not good And the shrimp do not get me started was the most overcooked shrimp I have ever tasted Wait I can t even say that I tasted it because I could not even cut through it with my knife That s how hard and overcooked they were When the waiter came over I demonstrated my attempt to slice and he quickly realized we were not exaggerating He was super apologetic I felt so bad because he looked like he was taking it as a direct reflection of his service They offered to make us another meal but we had enough already and passed on the idea The one good thing is that the manager removed the charge for the Shrimp Grits without hesitation But even though they removed the meal from the bill we still spent more than we should have based on the fact that we paid for the overpriced wine and tipped the waiter extremely well since he really did try his best to fix things Worst part all that money spent and we left hungry Sorry Chocolat but you will never earn my business again The only reason I granted you 2 stars was because of your waiter and the fact that you rectified the bill But this experience really deserved 1 star because the food was simply awful And it s all about the food for me 
0Fck0JjJBszcKpx6ze4ZpQ Columbia I can only really comment on the bar happy hour Being right across the street from my college this is a consistent go to spot for drinks for us The happy hour is a good deal all cocktails sangria wine are 5 bucks and they have some nice cocktails The atmosphere is pleasant with the upstairs being more laid back quiet and the downstairs more lounge y The food I have tried mostly appetizers were good no complaints The one time I ventured downstairs during a not happy hour time I think it was 11 was very strange loud music and what looked like nerdy 19 year olds dancing terribly If it s kinda late I d say stay upstairs Oh yeah and table service near the bar area sucks most times I ve been there it ll take at least 7 or 8 minutes to even find a waitress to get you another drink and they make it seem like chore If you re sitting at those high tables you re better off just grabbing a drink at the bar and bringing it over All in all I like the place 5 for a martini after a 3 hour class what s not to like 
0fJNAFzLWVkHnbgzdR8IeA Columbia I couldn t believe how good and fun this place was Nectar is a wine bar and they also have cheese and meat that can go along with your wine Nectar is simple and modern at the same time You get a great since of warmth there and the staff was very nice and had great recommendations on what wines and small foods that can go with it And if you want a great crowd then this is the spot Every time I ve passed by this place it s been packed This is a total gem and a hot find for anyone living in Harlem 
0FKC5h92HCf_LJmkp6Q3hA Columbia This is a place WHERE DREAMS GO TO DIE Soundz Where do I start The thing with Soundz is it s probably the most depressing bar I ve ever been to in my life Maybe it s the lighting or the layout or design of the place I can t really pinpoint it But all I know is that every bad night has ended at Soundz and I have never ever had a decent time there It along with Tom s restaurant near Columbia s campus has earned a place in my sarcastic lingo As you may often hear me say Well we could always go to Soundz whenever me and friends are planning a night out Personally I don t know anyone who likes this place I think it might be hell on earth BONUS FUN GAME Try not to cry yourself to sleep the night you visit Soundz 
0fkpR8udUM7GAwMkNu9Hgg Columbia We went on a Saturday for brunch and had a very nice time for the most part PROS The omelets are very big and pretty tasty I recommend the spinach and goat cheese The seven grain waffles were DYNOMITE as JJ would say The syrup was delicious The fresh raspberry preserve was yuuuuumy as well CONS The cafe con leche is not made with espresso Really Maybe living in Miami for several years made me a coffee snob but come on people The simple fact that it is in Spanish means you should not use American coffee ha The waiter had the personality of a snail or better yet a slug Would go back and order a tea with my meal 
0FTOanUEXg3Pr4rXwutmtA Columbia Super yum and super low key I like that there are authentic Mexican dishes alongside the football sized burrito maybe a basketball it is huge I have had the Pipian pumpkin seed sauce and Mole Rojo as well as standard tacos Bottled beers in the cooler perfect for chill dinner lunch or takeout 
0FZV4ctGjxEHWV7wwiOISA Columbia Sip is the epitome of an establishment that tries way too hard to be something that it s not The real question is what is it As Heather H points out it used to attempt a more Gothic pseudo Turkish approach to the typical Columbia bar The moody lighting and sophomoric drinks apparently didn t offer anything special enough for the the Columbia scene so they decided to restructure However instead of focusing they broadened their range Jack of all trades master of none is the expression that comes to mind and Sip does nothing right The drinks are all over the place like the terrible alcoholic Shirley Temple that would serve as a joke drink at a gay bar It could be the bartender as the ingredients of their drinks like their Last Goodbye or their mocha martini allude to far better drinks than are served Even more curious is their beer selection the bottles read like the line up at a mid western baseball game while their three beers on tap are two pilsners and a stout What the hell If a restaurant had only three wines would they serve two Pinot Noirs and a Port The food was the second to final insult for me Apparently the pot pie is the owner s favorite I m going to be optimistic and assume the owner lost his sense of taste in a bottle rocket accident The texture of the pot pie was fine but I m not sure how to distinguish it from a Banquet pot pie save for the two biscuits they stuck in it The mahi mahi should never have been on the menu but since it was I don t mind saying that recipes this bad aren t even served at Denny s Essentially it was low grade fish poorly cooked battered and served with lemon and some rice For 21 For 25 I could have had the pre fixe at A Cafe and had the city s best Pheasant Pate and Duck Confit At Sip you get a lump of fish and rice Yes as I alluded there was a final piece to the puzzle The service was terrible and they tack on a mandatory 18 gratuity At this point I don t even care to elaborate on my irritation with the mandatory tip essentially paying extra for terrible horrifyingly neglectful service as describing my anger is liable to cause a stroke Just know Sip is absolutely awful and you should write off the positive reviews as being written by naive college students that prefer atmosphere over substance Don t be fooled If you need a dank pit to drink in go to the far superior Ding Dong Lounge or Negrita a block over If you need food go anywhere else McDonald s even Message me and ask for recommendations Just don t support this place until they figure out what the hell they re trying to achieve and get a staff that has the talent to achieve it Or they give me my 90 back 
0g078uSydpflBfUXB0GqhQ Columbia I went to Symposium fairly often when I lived in the area back in the mid 1980s Went back recently just to see if it still exists It does and its as steady as ever The taramasolata baba hummus all rock The entrees are large and authentic 
0G4ZKDopC_aUBXUVrcJZBQ Columbia A quaint Italian place in the beginning of Harlem that serves incredible and simple dishes Very reasonably priced Dinner for two 25 including tip Top notch service and very fresh ingredients Great place for dinner I myself look forward to trying lunch soon 
0gdyV0TsDdd7K6QS8ADq1Q Columbia Disclaimer I m not 100 sure I m talking about the same halal cart as everyone else the one I went to was a little further up Broadway than the star on the map The one star is for the quick service Salad gross limp iceburg lettuce and a couple slices of nasty tomato smothered in white sauce White sauce tastes like mayonnaise straight out of the jar Rice eh okay A little greasy But the falafel Terrible I m sorry I ve never given a 1 star review before so part of me feels guilty but seriously So bad Falafel is supposed to have a nice crispy outside with a soft inside but this was all the same nasty consistency It was so old they had to cut it up into pieces and heat it up on the grill with the little chunks of meat sitting there so it ended up tasting like meat which for a person who hasn t eaten meat in 10 years is perhaps the most disgusting thing you could possibly do to your falafel I hate wasting food so normally I would just eat it anyways but had to throw this one out Yuck what a waste of 5 My falafel craving is NOT satisfied 
0Gi0YS48yBZ6IS6wI7YL3Q Columbia I know this place is very popular and that s why I gave it two tries The first time my haircut was okay not great and not bad but nothing to write home about This most recent time though it was just plain bad My hair actually looked better walking in than walking out and that s sad considering I had just slept on it and hadn t washed or styled it for two days I noticed during both cuts that the stylists didn t have good cutting techniques for long hair I ve gotten my hair cut at nice chic places and at 20 mall type places and they were definitely using the 20 mall techniques chop off a chunk here there and everywhere so that my long hair is choppy and looks like big poofy and mismatched especially in a ponytail Example I asked to get a cut framing my face and instead of cutting angularly as good stylists I ve been to do this woman cut off a horizontal chunk at the chin I even specifically said angled to frame my face I actually got home and trimmed it myself afterwards but even after a couple weeks it still looks too short Also I know my long thick hair is tough to blow dry but if I am paying 70 I shouldn t have to walk out go home and WASH MY HAIR because the blowout looked so stupid Let alone smooth or shiny I am talking frizz crazy and tangled Even I can do better with my 30 hairdryer and cheap drugstore products When my hair ends up looking like my mom s whose gotten it colored a million times and doesn t take great care of her hair I m not a happy customer Maybe it depends on the stylist but unless they ve jacked up their prices I think I was paying enough for the senior stylists I did see a couple of people walk out with nice looking short hair cuts If you have long and thick hair like me though I wouldn t take the risk I m trying elsewhere next time 
0gKkReJ6S-6BPSVIXagnJQ Columbia 3 5 stars It s fine Even good Basic Americanized Thai decent service timely delivery Music selection like so many restaurants in NYC is so bad it s almost good A different kind of entertaining I guess when you can spend your meal making fun of the music w your date 
0GkYzSl6he5Oe53EYm8SKg Columbia I had a burger and home fries It came quickly exactly as I ordered it Great spot I will order again especially if they expand the choices on the custom salad You have four included options with no mention of staples like carrots broccoli and onions 
0gs1HNYxDfSwe_b0AP0icQ Columbia Sip is definitely cool cant take that away from them but I found the food overpriced for the portion size I had the BLTA sandwich it was good I will prob go back but during happy hour or Mondays when food is half price 
0h0RqChCATGNqV3Zt4MS1Q Columbia Best pastry I tasted while on a 7 day vacation to New York Stumbled on it by accident just down from Columbia and across for the large St John the Divine Cathedral Lot s of Columbia students We orderd a cherry torte and apple turnover Great tastes as the dough was light succulent and very fresh Had coffee and ice tea both of which were freshly made Chatted with a couple of Columbia students as we munched A great find and stop for a snack 
0hAfa0CKoNGfgwAwdBVFSg Columbia OK so a few months back I had a really bad experiences with the cleaners They ve been better since Really trying It might be the fact that they don t want to mess up with us personally again but I dont care So far so good N Old review I wrote a great review about Marcel a few months back I am not sure what happened but it deteriorated ever since In the past month and a half I opened a returned shirt from 6 months ago a winter shirt I never used it over the summer just to find out it was never cleaned I called them and they said ah yeas but its from May well I did pay 8 for the cleaning in may and they did return it and it looked like it was cleaned so I never bothered checking it completely trusting them they didn t even bother taking off their stickers completely ruining the silk They did apologize for forgetting to tell me the didn t clean it Reimbursing me for the 8 When we gave them a coat to fixed they lied and said they will use a quality YKK zipper but they used a crappy zipper for 35 This week they sent us back a totally ripped shirt I mean they ripped a perfectly good 49 99 Gap shirt that we sent for washing and ironing It s a good thing we found out on time Than when we brought it over they said the will fix it I am a fashion designer trust me it was impossible to fix 3 days later they agreed to give us 22 50 in store credit Not full price and not money back I don t even want to use them any more I can not trust them anymore Oh well I guess i was wrong Beware 
0hkhOJFW7Q9O3hfK83Ollg Columbia We used to live pretty close to this place and got delivery from here on several occasions I am partial to their mango avocado chicken salad but I hate that on seamless web the default is no dressing instead of the recommended dressing but that isn t their fault My husband enjoys the chicken fajitas and I agree that they are quite good but it is necessary to order an extra side of guacamole Really their prices just aren t that great and they never send utensils with delivery despite my requesting them EVERYTIME 
0HT7-x-3oTJgnKAoesbNoA Columbia This bagel place is hands down the best in NYC I have been looking for a great bagel place on the UWS and have been unsuccessful until now Everytime you walk in the bagels are hot and fresh and even though the line may be long it goes pretty quick Additionally not expensive at all 
0huqR2u-3jMDOsD3DTB0oQ Columbia I randomly saw this store while wandering on Broadway and decided to step inside this is more of a pet store with lots of things your pets need than a pet boutique in case you re looking for a more refined store This store has what you need lots of toys for dogs and cats different types of food and treats and even a little display case with mini dog treats like donuts or cookies The store is a little cramped and is a bit overwhelming as things aren t very easily found It s likely got what you need though I even saw the Furminator 
0H_yptsDc4n1n92soyP6Lw Columbia Well as a Texan it is my duty to love all things deep fried especially fried chicken Just because I have moved to NY doesn t mean my quest for the best fried chicken has ended A friend from Texas came up to visit and was adamant about coming here at some point during the weekend Clearly he had done his fried chicken research and I always welcome anybody who wants to do the leg work for me Unfortunately we ended up here on a saturday afternoon after a particularly severe all night bender Needless to say I was in an equally severe amount of pain at the time I ordered my fried chicken but got it packed up to go because I knew I was in no shape to take in any solid foods However my friends ate at the restaurant and I can say that the service while I was there was nice They were quick to bring out the water and these little delicious corn bread cakes or whatever they were After a 3 hour nap I was ready to dig into my fried chicken and fries and waffle Even in my half drunk half hungover state I remembered to get hot sauce and maple syrup before I left The flavor was great but I prefer my fried chicken to be a bit crispier Now I know you re thinking that the quality was sacrificed because I took it to go but I had the forethought to examine the food when they first brought it to the table at the restaurant Trust me it wasn t as crispy as I prefer even fresh out of the kitchen But anyway the fries were delicious as was the waffle If it wasn t all the way up in nowhere 109th street I would probably go more often even despite the high prices 16 00 for fried chicken It s things like this that continue to remind me just how far away from Texas I am

0IOmK1I610NC7ZgtJ7AmlQ Columbia I came here on a Friday night with my friend Peter who lives just a few blocks from here and whom I know since our Edinburgh years This small Italian restaurant is cute and charming with a very nice wooden bar a huge mirror above it and wine bottles all over it gives out a warm and welcoming vibe By its look alone it is certainly a place where you could take a date The wine list is surprisingly short with just 4 5 bottles of red or white wine to chose from plus a house wine I certainly expected a bit more of a choice since by the sheer numbers of bottles all over this place could pass as a wine bar The beer selection also needs work the only beer they have that is worth mentioning is Blue Moon Since it was a mild and pleasant evening in October however we decided to have dinner outside Although let s face it the view over the Grant Houses projects is not particularly charming If you take a date here I suggest you stay inside For starters my friend had the mixed grilled vegetables 6 95 and I had the fresh fennel salad with parmigiano and balsamic vinegar 5 95 My salad was a bit disappointing I liked the oranges in it but the fennel was lacking that bitter kick that I was expecting Also where exactly was the parmigiano When I saw the homemade spaghetti alla chitarra with lamb ragu 11 95 I got very excited spaghetti alla chitarra are homemade egg spaghetti that are thin and square in section I love them and it s not easy to find them The dish is generous in size with a lot of lamb ragu which was very good Alas the spaghetti were a bit overcooked which was a bit of a disappointment Overall the bill was 45 each including tips for a bottle of wine an appetizer a salad and two pasta dishes The waitstaff is attentive and non intrusive The clientele despite this being Morningside Heights at the very border with Harlem was exclusively white 
0IsoVrs7EfPddv7ufCrjSg Columbia My girl Stacy showed me this place and it s got Greek down better than Zorba Fo realz The lamb kebob is fantastic and deyz even got a cheese they set on fire The pita is warm and tasty and you can t beat their mediterranes apps like the hummous babs ganoush and the like Tuesday nights you get a discount if y all rolling with the elite of Columbia Otherwise yo ass pays full price Either way it s worth it Oppa 
0IWKyqG-j97T9UZokNWvuA Columbia Upsides This place has the most affordable food in the neighborhood and the quality of the deli and produce is good Decent amount of space to walk through the aisles Thanks for the tip on the student discount I d been going here for three months and never asked it s 5 off Downsides You always need to be alert at the cash register since they will charge you extra The place smells bad as if they let food get rotten somewhere or just don t clean thoroughly 
0iXF4pRfRHJiCIXLdHXheA Columbia i thought it was pretty good despite some of the other reviews the prices are ok service wasn t that great our waitress wasn t very nice i liked their combo options 13 for 3 different rolls and miso soup or salad not bad the sushi bullet was amazing the plate itself looked really cool not the best sushi i ve ever had but it was pretty solid 
0Ixte6WCKWxGZP3pwElf-w Columbia This was my go to bagel spot when I lived up on 100th st Guess the word is out on this place The outside of their bagels are thankfully crustier than many of the bagels you find in NYC Not as crusty as my favorite Milk Honey on 45th b w 5th and 6th but admirably close considering this place isn t even owned operated by Jews it s Asian Wish Absolute Bagels and H H on 81st and b way would switch locations 
0j5hnbm_3I1zzrwRkCUqpQ Columbia Had one of the most memorable nights I ve had in Manhattan last Saturday when I accompanied Gordon on one of his Big Apple Jazz Tours in Harlem I ve been to a few of the big name jazz clubs in NYC Village Vanguard Birdland Fat Cat Dizzy s but had never really ventured outside of the downtown area to hear jazz And even though I ve lived in NYC for two years the farthest uptown I ever got was Morningside Heights so I jumped at the chance to explore Harlem and hear some great music at the same time We met in the Jazz at Lincoln Center building on 60th and Broadway at around 7 30PM where I was introduced to the rest of the tour two lovely couples one from the Bronx and one from Germany and Gordon gave us some preliminary info on where we d be going that night After the meet and greet we headed over to Columbus Circle where Gordon escorted us to the A train line that would take us to Harlem On the subway Gordon shared his seemingly endless knowledge about the history of jazz in NYC and what the scene is like today His combination of funny historical anecdotes and personal experience visiting clubs and owning one for a few years was informative and very enjoyable Once we got to Harlem we walked around the beautiful Sugarhill area and through Striver s Row while Gordon told us about some of the jazz greats who had lived in the neighborhood We proceeded to visit three different venues and hear some really fantastic live jazz The first was a trio piano bass and drums that sounded great On their break the musicians came and chatted with us We stayed for a bit of their second set enjoying great drinks and snacks and then walked down to 125th street We went past the Apollo and admired the surrounding murals by Harlem street artist Franco the Great then stopped over at a club where a blues band was playing The club was absolutely packed so we decided to forge on to the third venue It was a tiny place maybe 15 people in there with a live band that was really kicking The keyboardist drummer bassist and two sax players put out an incredible amount of energy and the whole bar participated by clapping singing and shouting in time with the music Gordon knew the staff of the places he took us and was clearly well loved greeted with a huge hug and big smiles That warmth definitely was transferred over to us the tour group as everyone we encountered was an absolute delight It was really great to discover these venues with a true insider like Gordon Thank you Gordon for providing all of us with this truly fantastic evening I can t wait to try your tour again and bring all my friends uptown to the restaurants and bars that you introduced me to

0juKRaZFHtqNeL011be7Tw Columbia Toms What can we say about Tom s Yes it is the Seinfeld restaurant Kramer s signed portrait hangs next to the front window The interior looks nothing like the set on the show The staff is kurt and abrupt in a way that many non new yorkers might consider to be very rude But for me it is home Get to know the waiters and they will call you by name when you walk through the door They might not say much else but why should they The place also has some of the greatest diner fare in the city Reuben sandwich is a must And be sure to ask for the Broadway shake It isn t on the menu but it is the best shake in manhattan Overheardinnewyork com Call it Tom s If you call it the Seinfeld Restaurant the tourists win 
0jXWer4d3AsOGoZtVCA7fQ Columbia DELICIOUS food I ordered the smothered chicken which came cornbread and my choice of 2 sides I got mac and cheese and string beans The chicken was so juicy and flavorful I m still dreaming about it I would have given them 5 stars but the waiter sucked at refilling our water 
0JzhDYBMNnZ06clJy1e0tQ Columbia Decent sandwiches and salads but the process of queuing to order then queuing to collect the food then queuing to pay is just too long and ridiculous if you plan to be out in less than 15 mins Plus I ve been 4 times and the women at the cash register never even acknowledge customers just chat amongst themselves 
0J_UVpImB5OMNHysMNx37g Columbia Toasted subs The hot cherry pepper rellish is delicious They have a good selection of subs but not as many as subway or anything though these are some good sandwiches They have salads and yogurts soups chips and sweets too This is actually the best deal on Columbia s campus There s usually a line but it goes by fast The staff are not the friendliest and like as your ordering the cashiers are yelling at you to pay already and it just gets confusing Just a nice little sandwich spot nothing to go out of your way for 
0k6er4PSNFyXwK6S1EoGYQ Columbia It s your run of the mill bakery and bagel shop My bagels have always been fresh and afforable and the service prompt though being greeted by the cashier with the words NEXT instead of May I help you was not pleasant though not uncommon round these parts It s nothing to rave about nor run back to But it is a safe choice for their fare nonetheless 
0KF_EOrWr9qjqkO8qCXmzA Columbia Good food An old fave from the 60 s 
0KJE_6CNbKT_tWVSKPrVOg Columbia Get the walnut cake Fun little spot with tons of character and apparently staying power since it s literally been in this spot for at least three decades Order at the counter given them your name have a seat and get comfortable anticipating the sugary goodness of whatever tickled your fancy I had a taste of the carrot cake and the apple strudel both of which were good but the walnut cake was my fave cinnamony not too sweet and a nutty crunchy texture 
0KMxzIBHLDfHNaUTSUQyvQ Columbia This place does have pretty good cake However one year I decided to splurge for my birthday and buy a big pretty cake from them I looked through their pictures for references and picked out one I loved I showed it to the employee and said I wanted that cake but in different colors She explained that it might be too difficult so I chose easier colors The decoration I chose was just flowers made of icing Very simple You can buy this pre made at many grocery stores Dairy Queen etc When I went to pick up my cake it was completely naked except for Happy Birthday and had little curly ribbons stuck to the top ribbon really I honestly could have done a better job myself It looked like they ran out of time and only had 5 minutes to decorate it It was nothing like I asked for When I request that they fix it a different employee explained that unless I made sure that the girl I ordered it from wrote specifically that I wanted flowers on it that I couldn t expect to get what I asked for So it was my responsibility to make sure the first girl could communicate the customer request to the decorator It was my fault she didn t process my request They acted like it was my fault that they made me a hideous cake Luckily I picked up my cake very early and had time for them to fix it They did a mediocre job fixing it as I could still see evidence of the previous horrible decorating job It looked okay and I needed to leave to my party so I had to accept it If I didn t show up early it would have completely ruined my birthday The cake was delicious but this was overall a bad customer service experience I will never order a specially made cake here again and would advise anyone else to make sure you provide your own picture or drawing or babysit the employee while they write a description of what you want since they can t be trusted to communicate like adults 
0KVh6eR4k2jPiyJpPDyuQA Columbia I d wanted to try this place and was excited to get a Google Offer for dinner I had the ravioli and my friend had the burger and fries Actually nearly every table in the place had the fries they seem to be the thing I also had an uptown rye their cocktail list is small but artisinal and we had espresso and flourless chocolate cake for dessert Everything was delicious and full of flavor even the pasta which we vegetarians often get tired of as our only option My friend really got into his burger and was even raving about the bun I ll be back here especially when I need a nice restaurant for all American eaters 
0kZzyHaJi0xox-T9Xw0WYA Columbia It s pretty good But I d say it s very Americanized I usually order kra pow Kai which was delicious The service was quite unfriendly It was interesting that when I spoke to them in Thai they understood it but answered back in English with thick Thai accent Weird Why not just speak Thai The price is also quite expensive for the small portion they give 
0lA1L0FkZ67juuhiuhURfQ Columbia Came here for breakfast with a group and really didn t like it I had the spinach omelet and it was tasteless I had to add a ton of salt It was way overpriced and the service wasn t great at all I wont be coming back unfortunately 
0ldrs4wUHWes_bYS-UkHRQ Columbia Great place to go for comfort food It s a great brunch spot I love the macaroni and cheese and the key lime pie is Amazing 
0lGfzO70OnDoP5epAoWyFw Columbia Overall this place does pretty well good for groups despite its small size BYOB reasonable prix fixe yummy bread on the side The food is an interesting mix of French and Carribean While the food is decent it wasn t awe inspiring I would go back to this place only if I m in the area Not really worth the trek from Brooklyn 
0Lk-CXqvzVDhZInoNgOMGQ Columbia This cute restaurant is close to Columbia and I really enjoyed my meal here both the tastes the atmosphere was excellent Dinner had a bit of a wait even on a weeknight and they wouldn t seat us until our entire party was present understandable I loved that the food here is quite affordable and also plentiful for the price point I had their Proscuitto e spinaci 10 95 it was so delicious and really light which I appreciated because I find most Italian places go so heavy handed on their sauces creams etc They also offer different specials for the night but I would definitely inquire about the price tag my cousin bf each got their seafood pasta special and it costs 25 per plate Just so you won t get a sticker shocker when the bill comes Overall if I lived in this area I would most definitely be back 
0m-VmaiDJu-qOYAed5tSxg Columbia Well first off I would like to tell you not to eat here ever If its not to busy maybe stop in for a cheap grain alcohol margarita if you can get the waiters attention that wears an ipod while working 
0MDeZgoPqYggMormcFFyqg Columbia My boyfriend and I only order any one of the stews which comes with yummy rice and beans Oxtail or goat if you re into that sort of thing and they have a great catfish stew sometimes but the chicken with potatoes is always a safe bet Oily but amazing flavorful goodness bursting at the seams of the foil containers that offers tremendous value for money We both eat a LOT and one dinner portion serves two comfortably This is THE go to place for cheap and satisfying Latin takeout in the Morningside Heights area Oh the restaurant itself for some inexplicable reason doesn t usually serve the stews The place is SUPER loud usually and the decor contains every garish tropical cliche you can think of but the staff is usually very nice and portions are good But of course I write about the sit in experience just as a cursory overview again I say do what we do and get the stew as takeout delivery already 
0MFSY2jzu0iTIa4ljcoyxQ Columbia Returned for another positive experience with what is our favorite place in Harlem It would be better if it was 5 blocks or closer but we will take what we can get I am tempted to move them to 5 stars but the 4 fits Our most recent visit was on Valentine s Day which they took reservations for They messed up our reservation but after a brief wait and free beverages thanks manager on duty we were seated This night s menu was modified from their usual so no eggplant appetizer tear They made up for it with a Lobster Fra Diavolo which basically had an entire lobster tail delicious For more thoughts on Pisticci read my 3 earlier reviews 
0mgy6emSgVZZC0j6ltKuvA Columbia Big portions tiny prices for authentic Mexican food I ve been introducing friends to this place since I tried it with the armchair psychologist on this board and we all love it Being a serious carnivore I have no problems with the dishes being heavy on the meat especially when they are well seasoned and tasty Yes seating is cramped and at a premium but you can always order it and take it home However then you miss the fabulous chips salsas which are SOOOOO good 
0MHg4AVlNvCOiK_0DVGa-A Columbia brunch review There were some major highs and lows to this brunch experience There are some unique brunch items on this menu like breakfast risotto and a new play on eggs benedict The truffled fries are good However the loud bass at least in the front part of the restaurant seemed very un brunch like It felt like I was in a club Also the service was really spotty Our waiter made it up to us in the end with a mimosa toast which was really nice and unexpected I d suggest not getting the bottomless brunch drinks unless you really plan on being there a long time The bloody marys are definitely large but you need to drink two of them to make the 9 90 deal worth it 
0MJxu6TG_DufZDAJxjY1BQ Columbia try the blackberry honey wine tastes like an ice wine went here and tried Ethiopian for the first time last night had the combo for 2 great food the flavors reminded me of indian and malaysian didn t love the spongy bread flavor it was good to start but the sourness and saltiness started to wear on me after a while the staff is great attentive and very friendly cute restaurant 
0MJyAlHDUX9pWaT3ZLNiVA Columbia There is a duality to a Columbia education two inherently contradictory aspects to the University s approach to learning that its students embody and endure On the one hand there are the tenets of the Core Curriculum It is an educational program designed to create Renaissance men and women Cultured and refined we emerge from the Core appreciative of the arts and knowledgeable in the sciences It is immensely elegant It imparts an intellectual grace At the same time it is a daunting effort to undertake It is a crushing workload requiring the student to absorb its teachings at a frantic pace to retain and recall vast stores of knowledge The Core is uplifting but the clip of our Ivy League education is exhausting While we learn from the texts of the past our futures remain unwritten Like a guest at a grand ball we are swept along in the riotous gala and leave a little ragged Bud upon completion when the last notes have died out the real dance begins We will be the first to seek a turn on the floor 
0mQNHrNBDla7xRO-V8K3Sg Columbia Yes this salon is close and very clean But 1 Prices are awful 2 Attitudes customer service non existent Ill travel else where for better 
0MWF-unzCb8tHkZa5K4_wg Columbia Such potential for this place We watched it go up and couldn t wait to try it Unfortunately though my turkey burger was decent my friend s gumbo was so abysmal she had to send it back it just wasn t gumbo In the summer it was as crowded as The Frying Pan only Harlem Tavern attempts to provide table service outside unlike The Frying Pan And the waitstaff is just overwhelmed during this time We were ready to leave to actually go down the block to Bier for their truffle fries to salvage our lunch and we had to wait so long ti find the waitress ask for the check receive the check get our cards back that Bier was between serving food when we arrived Sad I wonder if this trip s disappointment was just growing pains and I guess I d try it again at some point if only to support a local business 
0N6beD_DH0hA4EakOLWQLw Columbia I love this place Every time we have a kid s birthday party to attend we stop by Bank Street first and find the perfect book or toy and they wrap it up with no charge and make it look great Everybody else in the neighborhood must have the same idea The red and white wrapped presents always pile up fast They not only carry tons of kid books they carry tons of really good kid books Books that you wouldn t find at the much larger Barnes and Noble The staff is always super helpful and if you ever need a workbook or a game to help your child out with some problem area there is a great selection It s one of my favorite places in the neighborhood 
0NCpgXCWQmx2YGitZYsWVA Columbia This is the best pizza in the neighborhood it s affordable and tasty real cheese nice ingredients for the most part Stick to the pizza though So far the salad and pastas have been really disappointing And avoid the bacon it s strangely gristly That said I figure a good pizza place that delivers to Harlem warrants four stars for this place 
0nFadolPQdWkDT52qylq8Q Columbia Five stars for saving the neighborhood This area has been a wasteland of crappy bodegas since Floridita closed a couple of years ago Falafel on Broadway is delicious and they have a lot of variety I eat here 2 or 3 times a week and never get bored Also along with the tasty foods try their Turkish coffee Its the real deal 
0nItDOsytv5h-AVrBgQBeQ Columbia Bought a Living Social deal to this place and showed up for dinner To our disappointment the deal wasn t valid until 2 days later We were already there so we decided to stay Horrible idea First of all the prices are outrageous not what is listed online A burger costs 12 and doesn t even come with sides or french fries Second the servings are really small which makes you feel worse about the outrageous price you re paying Not the worst restaurant I ve been to the food is actually okay But it s just NOT worth how much they charge 
0nK6hzoDmvcUhVpb5pyMlg Columbia Frankies with chickpea and potatoes are fantastic I had a lamb one too but was pretty disappointed at how dry the meat was I d stick with anything with peas in them Cheap delicious late night eat which is sort of scarce in this neighborhood 
0NLLvARVy9VRGTDAZbmX3A Columbia A bit late adding this review never mind I travelled to NYC in May with the bike the five boro ride as the excuse to come across and to cycle New York First the ride agree with many of John T s comments that the ride might be better at Central Park with more of the Bronx but I have to say that the route as it was was pretty near perfect for me I got a bit fed up that they held the ride at a few points right at the beginning and then after Astoria to help manage the flow of riders as I wanted to get a good time I know it s not a race but still I did it in about 3 5 hours and was pleased with that I had a bit of a stroll around the stalls at the Staten Island festival but wasn t delayed at all getting on the ferry I heard that people getting the ferry later in the day had to wait ages Secondly I have to recommend cycling as a brilliant way to sightsee in New York I stayed in LIC solo trip so just wanted somewhere to stay but I really liked LIC and rode across the Q boro bridge every day It was great Whizzing about Manhattan and down to Brooklyn was just the best thing ever When you re on the subway you don t see things or experience them so I came across loads of sights that I would have missed e g Jewish Williamsburg was brilliant to ride through after doing Prospect Park I would highly recommend taking your bike or hiring one for the day You realy get a great feel for the city 
0nOblZaNYVYR_ZMujwnjhQ Columbia I joined the Dominican for lunch the other day at Mel s It was a better lunch than usual that s for darn sure I had a simple Classic Burger and he had something with bacon and cheese on it And we ordered the Atomic Fries They were indeed atomic And delish We both broke out in a sweat So worth it The burgers are juicy and perfectly seasoned Not too salty They also have a pretty fantastic selection of beers both on tap and by the bottle I saw they have growlers though we didn t partake I walked away so full and so happy Call me cheap if you will but I find the place to be more than a little over priced Especially at lunch I don t regret it but it was certainly the most expensive lunch I ve had in a while I wish they had either a lunch or midday happy hour deal to address some of the cost I would go back more often if I could more easily avoid buyer s remorse Yum yum That is all 
0nZhUcpazr7rgRxnA-cldA Columbia I love this place The owner is GREAT The staff is friendly And the food is amazing Keep it up Crepes 
0ogB3T-kab3TRvrkGpTPkA Columbia Best brunch EVER My friend would not stop talking about this place so we all finally went here to see what the hype was all about and holy bejeezus it lived up to that hype My friend ordered the gnocchi pancakes and it was to die for My GF ordered the spaghetti and meatball and it was pretty damn good even if I am not parse to tomato sauce I ordered the chicken pasta in white sauce with truffle oil Dude that truffle sauce was pretty amazing I didn t think it would have made a difference but it did Ended the meal with probably the softest and moistest coconut cake you that will ever touch your lips It probably fell off a sterling silver platter in heaven and landed directly on our mortal plate at Pisticci s 
0OGyJbq8m_T6OX8AV0fhQA Columbia This place is ree donk cue less Incredible crepes for a unbelievable price I had a crepe with Nutella caramel and fresh tangerines My wife had a crepe with Nutella Caramel and spiced diced apples Needless to say we came in our pants it was THAT ree donk cue less The only reason I give it a 4 5 is that there were flies EVERYWHERE It was pretty effing dirty when you walk in The windows had finger print marks that looked like they had been there for well over a month I don t suggest you order for delivery which they do because once your food gets to you it may be cold Crepes aren t known for keeping warm for very long So get em and scarf em down but enjoy the diabetic coma you will be in from the orgasmic sugary rush 
0p5O2yZj_iyOlf1n5Oqg1w Columbia The food is just really good from the macaroni and cheese to the burgers It s a bit overpriced so it loses a star by me but you leave satisfied And they deliver 
0PD5Zid-OgbaW2vhYR7dOA Columbia Came here over the weekend for some day drinking and to watch the Rangers game It was such a good time The food and drinks were great and the staff was really attentitive There was a room in the back for beer pong too Definitely would come back here again 
0PiMjmzVMqR0vByEgEaadA Columbia I am not sure how to give this place 3 5 stars but that s what I would do if I could V T is good the pizza tastes great and the sauce is tasty but they tend to rush delivery orders so your food may be undercooked To advise ask them to make the pizza well done and wait another 5 minutes The eggplant pizza is my favorite but even when I was a little kid we ordered the everything pizza and I loved it We had their number memorized and the food hasn t changed except now I don t eat meat I still think this is the best pizza in the immediate area 
0pLYU_LcTilD1zwyjZBl_g Columbia I never realized how great Ethiopian food was It seems the ingredients in Ethiopian food are very similar to the stuff used in South Asian cooking Either way its all very good The wait staff and bartender are all very cool and nice people If you re in the mood for something different this is the perfect place to go Good food good atmosphere and a unique dining experience 
0PqISHQH88IiwYG45JwFjw Columbia I had lunch here 2 days ago and I didn t leave satisfied at all I ordered the avocado chicken panini but it took soo long The way to order is confusing for a newbie Ordering is just like a deli or a restaurant where they have different kinds of cuisine pizza salads wraps etc I think you order at the counter that has the menu above My friend ordered a salad and I promptly ordered a panini at the same place It literally took 15 to make and my friend was already half way through We only had a 30 min lunch break The sandwich itself was meh The avocado kept slipping off It wasn t a well made panini They put in a ton of avocado in though The grilled chicken was lemony It came with chips in the plastic container Not a bog fan of then but whatever To wrap it up food meh decor okay seating good staff nice Ps Someone behind me ordered a chicken cutlet hero To make it the took a chickencutlet in a plastic blaggy and microwaved it In A Plastic Bag No me gusta I mean I don t expect them to bread the chicken then and there but the plastic bag was too much Maybe I ll come back if I m truly desperate 
0psRgSdcXVECJ7AeMV-PQQ Columbia I can only give it 4 stars because while they rarely carry the particular book I m looking for I can always request it online and expect them to have it in 2 4 weeks This might seem like a while but the book is free to borrow so what more can I ask for I also really like that this branch is new ish and has an elevator It doesn t usually smell too bad and the children s book section covers what appears to be a 1 3 or the library 
0pwCXMBwVDLu0XGcX8eAgg Columbia Without a doubt this it my favorite dive bar of all time The main features of the bar include great music from an extensive jukebox a pool table with plenty of good competition a game console with nearly every bar game you can want a downstairs which often features a DJ dance party or an open mic and seven t v s with just about every sporting event Let s not forget the wonderful and lovely bartenders Tina that s you They keep our glasses as full as they keep our hearts 
0pZNmVaS0xgHWG02giuxoQ Columbia Had brunch here one Sat morning five tables occupied when we were seated waited one hour for cold pancakes and french toast A friend at Columbia says that when their dept goes to Havana Central for lunch its understood that it will take at least an hour and a half Maybe slow as shit service gives points for authenticity but when in Rome The more traditional dishes ropa vieja tostones empanadas arroz con pollo are adequate and sometimes bland The Jazz Brunch on weekends is very loud and not always jazz The coffee is bitter and the staff painfully apathetic With better Cuban joints on the UWS Havana Central leaves little to recommend itself 
0Q7Aph9TLRG7Vg-fcC-qZw Columbia Tom s isn t as bad as it s made out to be but it s not good either Stay with simple things and you ll be fine Also you cannot leave without getting a milkshake Ask for it malted if that s your thing it s not mine The breakfast is decent and the service is quick if gruff Late at night you will find this place packed Sitting at the counter can be an experience but the milkshake is really worth it as the server glares at you Be prepared for some drunk Columbia students making a ruckus This is the closest diner to Columbia and it has simple things grilled cheese cheese fries eggs and toast that you can t get closer to campus at least for cheaper If you re looking for an actually decent diner I d head down to Metro Diner on 100th Street Also cross to the other side of Broadway to avoid being in the background of some random tourist s photo 
0QOLOg1kBfZGz7bxZB96GQ Columbia I had the most ridiculous experiences on 125th street this week I was taking the M60 bus back from LaGuardia and we stop at Lexington Ave No surprise there Then things got weird I heard some shouting outside of the bus Five minutes later we still hadn t moved Turns out a man in an electric wheelchair had been sitting directly in front of the bus preventing it from moving I am not entirely sure what happened but I think he was claiming that the bus had hit him which I highly doubt to be true He had an amputee in a wheelchair corroborating his story it quickly devolved into a complete s tshow and I was outta there So I decide to huff it over to Lenox to catch the subway On my way over there a guy approached me trying to sell me a CD to help with his band and mobile studio and I was going to give him a couple of bucks for the CD Well apparently the minimum donation for a CD is 10 so instead he just took the two bucks said I was a real dude and walked off Fantastic Oh and in case you re curious by the time I walked four blocks to Lenox and got on the train the M60 still hadn t caught up with me 
0qTPIpBMCkOogRQay2AdYQ Columbia CONS Snooty attitude Strong exclusive hipster vibe esp at the communal tables Service is unfriendly and takes FOREVER Pretty expensive PROS The food from what I ve experienced is a bit greasy but quite delicious Not sure if it s worth the long wait though The coffee is fabulous 
0r13zHrHhh77lijaqA6fhg Columbia One of THE best banana blue berry crepes I ve ever had Delicious 
0r1ZIuhHNu-k70x4vlU4mQ Columbia This is my first firmly negative review I ve written and considering I professionally for blogs and as a contributing writer for The Observer Hmm I wish I read the reviews here before picking this unfortunately convenient location Wow I wish I could be empathetic but I can t It would be illogical Not only are they rude they are unable to function in a normal manner My experience in short They lost my medication which had time constrains attached to it Making me have to ask my friend for her spare prescription antibiotics of the same dosage etc until they we re ready It was fine I finally received it And it was okay because they woman in the front was friendly The real downer came when they double charged me for this misplaced medicine by confusing this old prescription with a new one They gave me the wrong medication which was the old one they misplaced Then I had to wait to get the right medication which made me miss a month of a prescription which was also time constrained They were rude about this and made me feel embarrassed by shouting my prescription across the pharmacy section No big deal just a little degrading The eye rolling isn t really cute either Medication is IMPORTANT don t be an ass about how you treat it It is people s health Duane Reade is so ugh now just another big corperation killing the local atmosphere of our New York It is definately not Our Duane Reade for Our City Forget that Never shopping here again Forget it 
0R4y7MOO_lD-0alCA68XEQ Columbia Around Columbia University Morningside Need Asian comfort food Come to the Mill It s got weird decor that is for certain The decor seems like something out of the Scholastic I SPY book I SPY a Singer sewing machine Nothing mind blowing about the food I wouldn t trek here for Korean but the food is solid and it scratches the itch 
0rEmsAOFOnJoJbSvL1Jpmw Columbia We have been going here for years and have always had a great meal It is BYOB major bonus points in my opinion and they have a pre fix for 20 or 25 appetizer and entree They use sustainable products even the drinking glasses are made out of recycled corn product and the food I think is organic They have great veggie options like seitan meatloaf as well We highly recommend this lil gem of a place 
0RfQEwdgulOlT9Cn491YpA Columbia Order snafu to start but very friendly staff Had the special which was sundried tomato ricotta ravioli as take out for lunch Excellent prices in line with NYC 
0rOlnsV4VflE6qkaOy4Qlg Columbia During the week Sun Thur there is a 15 drink minimum but no cover The jazz is pretty good The venue is small but intimate and the sound is good 12 for a Beefeater martini and the olives are excellent is fair Sets at 9 11 and 12 30 I avoid it on the weekends big cover and it s not really better than the weeknights but during the week it s a nice night out Definitely a good date I was there tonight and they were recording a live CD so the band was on their game it was some spectacular music 
0rpxEEKoVL2h8RzKvW7CIg Columbia The food is OK What makes it special in this neighborhood is that it is so cheap It s fun to sit on the roof or near the huge windows on a nice day Service is usually nice and fast A good place for lunch 
0Ru1MDcfH-hWCH7KkxXlDg Columbia Don t bother 
0rZifozwhaDJ6KMGACQWhQ Columbia I stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch with my father We were searching for a place thar serves Ful an Eritrean dish The ful was tasty and good The portions were more than enough Food Service was great 
0s1-h27kOT0GGXEutOgRGQ Columbia This restaurant is a solid 4 stars Upon arriving we were seated in a loud plate clanking section where my delicate nose was drawn to the smell of cleaners and pine sol We asked one of the cool looking managers wearing ear pieces if we could be seated elsewhere and they promptly moved us to another section The glass of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc we had was smooth and fruity complementing the rest of our courses Must get the grilled octopus appetizer My husband and I both order the specials Hubby got skirt steak which I found a bit fattier than usual and I got the braised lamb pasta special My pasta was delicious but it was missing a salty ingredient perhaps parmesan to make it out of this world I asked the waiter for parmesan twice but he forgot The dish was satisfying enough for me to finish without the added cheese Overall our experience at Vareli was a pleasant one 
0S4mVrhhSfTsKRtBF_W_BQ Columbia I love this little cozy place This place was highly recommended by the owners of the B B during our NYC trip back in Dec Yeah I m a bit slow at updating bash me bash me We were immediately seated to our table We noticed that everyone around us had a delish breakfast entree I had the Kitchenette Special 7 which includes free coffee until 11am My partner had the Farmhouse Breakfast Each breakfast dish was perfect Coffee was tasty Service was great If I lived in NYC The Kitchenette would be one of my fave places for breakfast and lunch Awww I m so missing NYC right now 
0S759FCT4joMGAtfH_KcgQ Columbia IF your main criteria for a slice are that it be over sized and cheap and IF you think you d enjoy pizza whose taste and crust mouthfeel approximate sheet rock left out in the rain slathered with Ragu and Polly O mozzarella and IF you are heinously hammered craving grease and have just emerged from the subway on 110 and Bway and Koronet s lights resemble an oasis in the desert then by all means grab a slice here If on the other hand as a NYer you relish your proximity to myriad quality pizza places and wish to exercise a modicum of discernment go elsewhere 
0sbWmE2zx4N5APH53o-HwQ Columbia I love that this unlike the AirTrain actually gets you all the way to the airport for the same fare as a regular ride For early morning trips it can t be beat Yes it can and will get crowded but commuters take this bus too So just try not to be an ass I just got on the bus and there are finally finally luggage racks Score They removed 4 seats but its a small price to pay to not have huge bags blocking the aisles 
0sC7QXEOqWcba_DXSzMgnQ Columbia I have never loved this 116st off shoot of the uptown store However I ve tried to give it the benefit of the doubt Well they have finally sealed their fate as a horrible institution I was in a wedding this afternoon and the make my cake wedding cake that was ordered did not show up When called the shop informed us that they did not make the cake The order was lost They proceeded to do nothing they did not attempt to offer anything as a stand in or an offer of good will Can you imagine if your wedding cake didn t show up Luckily this couple were blessed with a beautiful wedding despite of Make my Cake s gross failure I will never visit them again Customer Service is everything Obviously MMC needs a lesson in that 
0SCScUy2687KIP80nrnOUQ Columbia Leave your quarters behind This newly renovated laundry has only one way to take your money You rent a card for 3 refundable and fill the card with cash All of the machines read this cash card so no more jammed or dropped quarters The place is very clean now and the staff friendly and helpful If you re lucky they ll be playing some great music to bop to while you fold 
0SeZDjZ64IO0nMiJI2u4Yw Columbia Went here twice already and loved both times The Bagel Deluxe looks excellent I had their Quesedilla and Fries once with cheese once w gravy I liked the one with cheese better Second time I went I ordered the Thursday special with baked macaroni and cheese which came with soup and salad With a small appetite I had to box it up and ate it up in three meals around 10 dollars plus tax and tip Pretty good The service is always good Waiters and waitresses are both helpful Enjoyed my times there From what I hear other than their delicious dessert their milkshakes are heavenly too I m saving that for next time Downside CASH ONLY 
0SGicMBIlVyIKndexPeTMg Columbia I moved to New York this year and brought a sick cat with me The only reason that I m not giving this vet one star is because my previous vet wasn t able to figure out what was wrong with my baby either I have a twelve year old cat that had been experiencing excruciating constipation for over a year When we made the move here it was getting worse and I thought that I would lose him soon I took him to the Uptown vet for a checkup hoping that she could help me out What ended up happening was that she ran the same tests that he already had prescribed the same treatment and gave him an enema which had already been done On top of that he was sent home immediately after the enema and had not been cleaned up He was covered in feces and continued to ooze feces for another couple of hours All of this cost me over 500 and I knew nothing more about his condition than when I went in Turns out that I only needed to change his cat food I can t believe that was never discussed I was feeding him Innova Evo and was told it was a great product guess it wasn t for my cat He is perfectly healthy now and is acting so much younger Shouldn t that have been the first thing we talked about 
0sk7vYafr-JnYpPx9tvRnQ Columbia I have a lot of experience going to Haakon s and I would recommend it for drinks dinner I get something different every time but at the bar I get the wings desert cookies or pumpkin pie catering or private parties I ve use both services to anyone Atmosphere sophisticated without the extra fee The Chef is the best cook and will work with you They stay pretty busy and Chef likes to be on the floor with his customers if he can He is a fun and warm guy even though at first he seems stressed because he likes everyone to be perfectly happy and to feel welcome I am there 3 times a week and use them for 90 of our parties I had a Thanksgiving party and Halloween Party for 75 people each On Halloween the party food was suppose to end at 11 00pm James the Chef kept the food coming out until brought out new appetizers till 11 15 unheard of anywhere in the city and without an extra charge For Thanksgiving we ended up having less people show up than expected and Chef made sure everyone got seconds which was amazing because the food is AWESOME Chef is also helping me with a fundraiser So it s a great place food atmosphere and people 
0SlUAL4cqFfKf8Z2j8d6Tg Columbia Amazing selection of groceries and basic necessities Beats out other neighborhood supermarkets in terms of quantity and price Has a good deli sandwich selection and also has DELICIOUS salads Oh it s also open 24 hours 7 days a week What more do you need 
0SQ4RiwCBoaUC2qTLgq9mg Columbia Two words imitation scallops I never even knew such things existed and a reasonable diner would not imagine that he would be relegated to eating imitation scallops parmigiana for 16 not even in Manhattan Nevertheless there are some gems on the menu The pizza is reliably good The complimentary bread is quite tasty crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside I also like the broiled lamb chops simple and lightly seasoned and served with the part that most restaurants don t serve the tiramisu the chicken soup and minestrone soup On the other hand the pasta and side dishes are average The hardness of the steamed peas reminded me of stale Japanese style fried peas Overall 2 5 
0sQWQawQvvbwBIrM38OQCA Columbia The happy hour specials are great 3 for some great beers like Stone IPA and Dogfish Head but the food is uninspiring and overpriced for what you get I d recommend this place to grad students who are looking for a cheap good drink before heading elsewhere for dinner I usually find myself in the lounge area which is a little less formal than the main dining area It s pretty comfortable and I like the cavernous exposed brick ambiance The big drawback to sitting here is that the DJs and bartenders keep the music at a rather high volume for 5 30pm on a weekday It would be nice if the management monitored the volume more closely so that customers could carry on a conversation without having to shout 
0SQxys9TPaqGkTKvIqv3eg Columbia Went here for lunch today had the famous blueberry pancakes They were good but I dunno about great They are extremely sweet and I love sweet things The syrup that even comes with it is like melted caramel Again sweet My friend had a chicken sandwich which he said tasted like they used real quality ingredients The restaurant itself is very trendy and a nice addition to Morningside Heights although if you are a college student you might wanna go to another more affordable restaurant 
0szlVsOb6o0Vzm-nui5YDg Columbia It s pretty good and unlike H H they actually spread the cream cheese put the lox on for you And for that bit of work they get the extra star It s half that I m lazy but moreso it s way awk going to starbucks to cut condiment your bagel that you clearly didn t buy there 
0T1rAbqy1arLsgM9ZKlrqQ Columbia Tried a few things and I think the Unda Aloo with egg is the best The ones with protein chicken and shrimps were alright I think they do vegetarian stuff better Mango lassi was good but nothing extraordinary 
0taEWvSQraGOs6hKgSWrNw Columbia I ve been coming here on and off since 2007 and can say the food is always excellent and you can t beat the price Lunch specials even on the weekends large portions and fresh great tasting food I m not a huge fan of Thai food but this place seems to do it a bit differently than the standard Manhattan Thai places If you re in the area I recommend it 
0TaRBtXH4hqrPLz4JHMAYg Columbia I have eaten a lot of bagels in my life but the most creamy delightful bagel in my life was had on the Upper West Side this past weekend With an inexpensive price perfectly made in house bagels and a wide variety of cream cheeses this place is the best Not a lot of wasted money on a storefront but the line literally loops around out onto the sidewalk You might think that with this much business you have to wait but oh no you have your food in under 7 minutes I ate there twice and both times it was incredible Plus the price is ridiculously inexpensive Fresh basil tomato and garlic onion on a everything you are my dream made tasty 
--05HWh3tFtXAjTV4vquHg Harvard Harvest is such a hidden gem This restaurant is tucked away behind several storefronts in Harvard Square The neon sign outside does not do it justice it is a very upscale restaurant with a great ambiance and inner courtyard The food was great our waiter was able to recommend a nice wine pairing as well We had an interesting sweet corn chowder very rich The french fries with truffle oil are to die for you can t eat just one The fish was excellent and the dessert menu was very nice Would go back for a special occasion in a heartbeat 
--46ezsfr0zUzYcFJGmn8Q Harvard The Harvard Square Holiday Craft Fair is the only shop that I really like to use for the holidays It actually gets me in the holiday spirit I just love to see all the cool jewelry knick knacks trinkets handmade sweaters mittens gloves scarfs little cute baby clothes etc I love this craft fair and I hate shopping and hate crafts but for some reason I love this place It s in a great location too And you won t break the bank and you will support artisans YAY 
--8RcuC1LWyTCE1WP5fYVg Harvard I m teetering Maybe 4 stars Evoo is very good so I ll preface the 3 star treatment by saying that And perhaps I should be more generous since yes it was restaurant week and we all know that restaurant week is probably the worst time to try a restaurant for the first time but It still took WAY too long for each of our courses to be served and my glass was empty on 2 seperate occasions for 10 minutes or more Not cool But the waiter was other wise awesome very funny amicable and knowlegeable I m going to chalk it up to them being very busy but at the same time excuses are excuses nto reasons The dining room nice airy but a little too contrived I felt a bit like I was in a boloco or Arlington VA Inother words modernly vanilla But clean and comfortable so not bad overall The service I ve discussed above awesome in one direction crappy in the otehr HOpefully I was just a bit unlucky The food OK this is the most important category and yeah this is the real winner here The littlenecks in vegetable brothe with lambs bacon was pretty fantastic I felt a little wierd spooning the brothe but it was worth it very tastey Not a huge fan of the bacon but it added a lot of flavor so I could deal with it Main course BEEF sirloin over a grilled slice of marinated eggplant drapped in yellow and green string beans tossed with sweet corn and jalepenos both sweet and spicey This was really pretty freakin good especially for restaurant week The presentatio nwas really very nicely done adn the dish was really a cliched party your mouth Totally dug it Dessert ughmmas homer simpson drool chocolate truffle souffle presented in a lightly carmelized marshmellow pool Do I need to say more I tried to convince the waiter that I had dropped mine on the floor to get a second one He wasn t biting It was pretty effin good Ah Beverages I was pretty pedestrian last night just a few beers and a glass of pinot with dinner The beer was a local brew CDC or something like that slightly malty but had like zero aftertaste and was pretty refreshing for a darker beer not amazing but decent and I guess some of hte proceeds of the profits from the brewery support ALS So Curt Schilling I was helpin your cause out last night while getting a little buzz goin Wine was nothing extroardinary but good for ahouse glass I can t really complain since I was too lazy to look at hte wine list to pick something out OK so I guess I shoudl bounce this up to 4 stars I ll ponder it 
--A4cmT6fwNwRhQtMP8ydg Harvard I don t understand why this place is so highly recommended service is very very slow only one waiter Food portion is very very small Food is ok but over priced After came here twice I decided not to come back again 
--C48_u1O3itnceAG4Necw Harvard without having won a gift card for the place i don t know that i d have ever heard of cafe 47 i m super glad my boyfriend is an avid WEEI listener because this place is great we went on a monday night and were the only ones there save for a few take out orderers cozy and cool i enjoyed the decor and loved the music that was playing lots of live acoustic classic rock led zeppelin came on a few times the service was fast the burgers are pretty much amazing they re very grilly tasting and juicy as tends to always happen i was jealous of my bf s burger the baja shrimp salad was excellent i was weary about the size whether or not it d fill me up so i ordered a side of sweet potato fries the fries were super delicious but i didn t need them because the salad was very filling the layers of flavors were highly complementary and everything was fresh i swapped the shrimp for chicken because i was going to a concert which involves lots of beer and i didn t feel like burping up the sea all night it was a good choice they had rapscallion on tap and it went down nice and easy the narraganset is cheap and i totally wanted to try all the sangrias on the very long wine list the prices are very reasonable and the portions are great such a lovely place 
--kLgVzrVCrpIaqFcZplHg Harvard Nice unassuming Italian eatery Me and the Wifey arrived late thanks to some GPS and parking issues We were told only pizza was available DAMN Oh well pizza it is I had the Fat Boy and the Misses had the Margarita Both were excellent and at 10 each for the small you can t go wrong Beverages and desserts are reasonably priced So I will definitely be heading back Earlier of course 
--nZspRkZQUSj7RM72GMeQ Harvard When I first moved to Boston I had a really bad impression of ABP which dated back to the late 80s in DC Since I ve been working at Kendall Square I ve found that the quality at Bone Pain on Main is extremely high The pastries and breads are much better than I remembered and this is now my 1 choice for quick breakfast on the way in to work I go in for an egg and cheese sandwich on a fresh toasted asiago bagel but half the time the pastries are just too tempting The lunch sandwiches and salads are also quite good though Rebecca s next door gives them an even run for the money 
--VL6Kcx34n_dAWthdoNzQ Harvard An awesome coffee shop close to my house YAY Very cute nice vibe Perfect for doing work and free wifi Lots of outlets The artwork here at the moment is pretty good I d consider buying some I love ceramic drip coffee unfortunately the coffee here isn t as delicious as Blue Bottle in SF or Intelligentsia in Chicago but glad someone is doing it somewhere Still pretty good though This place is definitely worth checking out a different kind of cafe than almost all of the others in Boston and Cambridge 
--xpb60CS8zEDRzMD0lqaw Harvard Cuchi Cuchi Cute atmosphere with tasty appetizers and very good cocktails Karen our server was a doll I ll be yelping back with a detailed report when I come for dinner Four stars due to the fact I haven t tried dinner We ll see how finely it will be executed Five stars to our lovely waitress 
-03JOPva3PM4ZRGSfoXvfw Harvard Pearl Street Laundry does my laundry for me every few weeks I love them Their prices recently went up from 1 a pound to 1 10 lb but it is still totally worth it Not only do they wash dry fold but they match my socks The staff are friendly and the turn around on 33lbs of laundry is remarkable sometimes it s ready the same day but it never takes more than a day I ve never had anything lost or damaged in the year that they ve been doing my least favorite chore for me However I wouldn t bring your dry cleaning here I brought a few sweaters last summer and one came back complete misshapen and had a few holes in it They don t do the drycleaning in house so you re probably better off looking for a place that actually does their own laundry Now I just need to find someone who will put my laundry away for me when I bring it home 
-074mEo_MuLBOfzLTgcc5w Harvard I was pleasantly surprised by the great selections of beer I love Hoegarden on tap the appetizers and pizza We had this eggplant appetizer that was unbelievable We then split 2 small pizzas BBQ chicken and special and they were both equally good Staff was very acessible and approachable Owner equally friendly All for an incredibly reasonable price Best yet it was about a 5 minute walk to Fenway Park after down Commonwealth Avenue Without the stress crowds of the Kenmore restaurants Few tables outside it it was not raining I will definitely be back 
-0cuQZx18bGYt-OmS_On7w Harvard Pyara you could have so easily been a 5 Saturday afternoon was the perfect time for a relaxing facial My hangover had just subsided from drinking my face off the night before and a frigid wind had started ripping through Boston it was the perfect time to ensconce myself in a spa and get a little pampered The spa itself is gorgeous and very similar to all other Aveda experiences I ve had I got a facial for senstive skin and a very gentle plant peel and left with perfectly glowy rejuvenated skin not an easy task after my Friday night My only issue was my aesthetician Chrissy She was perfectly nice and seemed knowledgeable but she had a bit of a professionalism problem stemming from a LOT of talkativeness I am typically a very chatty person and can easily sustain a 3 hour conversation with someone I just met so you KNOW this was a bit extreme I heard allllll the details of Chrissy s personal life which is not something I care so much about when I m paying to relax There s a time and a place you know Chrissy did tell me she s moving to DC soon so at least this won t be an issue in the future 
-0H-98olXR_8qiNapt_wtw Harvard I came here on two separate occasions Once after a kayaking outing in the summer so we sat outdoors and it was a party of 5 and then in December for lunch with just my friend and I I didn t like it too much the first time I went and we all had a variety of pizzas there was a smoked salmon one a mac and cheese one a children Alfredo one and a portobello mushroom one I remember the mushroom and salmon specialties were highly regarded amongst the group Their earl grey iced tea was also tasty in the summer My December visit called for a mac and cheese pizza and a chicken with broccoli and caramelized onions with feta cheese pizza The mac and cheese one was good and gooey but needed salt The chicken specialty doesn t taste good if you eat it cold or if you warm it back up I highly recommend sharing these pizzas because even though they are personal pizzas 2 3 slices out of 8 really fill people up Also I have never gotten a salad here but they are not stacked on a bunch of lettuce just to add volume So if the menu doesn t list a lettuce or green do not expect it Just a heads up Oh ya this place is very busy in the summers but not for winter lunches We were the only ones there at 1pm on a Tuesday 
-0idSmMPJmppw-xwQszasw Harvard I am generally a big subway fan and because I usually enjoy the brand and appreciate the options they give me I am giving this place 2 stars instead of one But as many reviewers have said before these people can t get an order right And they go way too crazy on the condiments You re much better off taking your own sandwich to the reading room 
-0nFTjL9OzDAKxDT3M3QPg Harvard Decent italian place Has parking 
-0PZxOXJcG6brIiRhjkung Harvard I have eatten at Harvest over fifty times and it is consistently good The atmosphere is casual comfortable elegance with warm colors and dark woods You can chose to dine at the bar lounge area the dining room or in the outdoor garden area during summer season The bar itself is great when you are alone I eat everything on the menu including varieties of fish steak poultry oysters salads soup hamburger and small bites at the bar They have a full bar and a wine list Sunday brunch is excellent but be sure you very hungry as it is three courses It is great place for a date casual conversation drinks dessert or a special occassion All the waitstaff host and bartenders are very professional and polite This is one my favorites in Boston Cambridge Keep in mind a average dinner is about 75 00 a person Parking in Harvard Square is difficult unless you valet park 
-0q6D6dbzW2ly5b1eDvuhg Harvard There s a reason why Mr Bartley s is a legendary burger joint and still around The explanation is dead simply It s freakin good Reading the menu is a joy in itself and it changes relatively frequently keeping up with current celebrities and happenings Sounds strange Check the pictures and you ll get it Bottomline is that you get super quality ingredients cooked to perfection Hail Mr Bartley 
-0QWJ26cb9sl8wIumrs1Ug Harvard Why is it so hard to get quality and cheap food in the Kendall area for lunch I m not really going to complain much about the food it was actually pretty good but an iced tea and a sandwich ran me 10 and for someone on a budget that is just a little too much for lunch Anyway I thought I d try it today in the hopes of finding a new place for lunch whenever I leave mine at home I got the Chicken Pesto Melt and it tasted rather well but it didn t feel to cozy sorry for bad pun in my stomach after about an hour Which coincidentally was almost as long as it took me to get my sandwich after waiting in line and for my number to be called and I showed up at 12 45 hoping it would be after the rush It was ok food and all but I m not sure I ll be back anytime soon I d rather walk to KHOP for a chicken parm it s friendlier on my wallet 
-0Tabf_pcnDypdFyIDtHrw Harvard Just what Central Square needed Honestly With one of the worst Thai restaurants I have ever tried Pepper Sky and with no other good options for noodles curry and my other favorite things in Central I was so excited when Monkfish appeared And it hasn t disappointed Great noodle dishes basil fried rice an extremely expansive vegetarian menu including lots of vegetarian sushi it s all pretty good not amazing but pretty tasty It s usually crowded but they do take reservations and in my experience they are always pretty efficient no matter how busy the restaurant is And they live up to the name with some sweet jazz tunes playing over the speakers 
-0xgp_OlKt7NixdZ1YOEBQ Harvard Jen recommened Takemura to me and I ve been looking forward to trying it and it lived up to the expectations I got a spicy tuna the crispy creme roll and some yellowtail sushi The server was very friendly and the restaurant was quiet so I got my order quickly The crispy creme was delicious I highly recommend it The spicy tuna was also good although it may have had almost too much in it like a little too big and packed I like nice bite sized spicy tuna rolls I didn t like the yellowtail at all it was a little fishy The other reason I won t give it 5 stars is that they don t deliver anywhere in Somerville not even right behind Porter which is very close to where they are I would order from here a ton if they did If you re in Harvard stop in and get the crispy creme you ll be happy you did 
-0YFPJpcxMf2gutjwPPLlw Harvard I got taken on dates here when I was sixteen I got taken on a date here last year about a month prior to becoming gluten free yes last year shut up a couple of weeks before someone got shot just like when I was sixteen Oh nostalgia It s exactly the same as it ever was except the mural is more worn The pizza is still cheap and good Blotting with napkins for the over abundant grease is necessary but they make up for that requirement with the amount of cheese and toppings Start eating it as hot as you can stand to Past around lunchtime avoid the slices as they get progressively more dodgy as the day goes on just share a pie The mozzarella sticks are still tasty and that sort where the cheese will stretch as far a forearm the steak and cheese subs are way underrated somehow they still have an alcohol license and the drunk college kids naively talking about their lives and their interpersonal relationships still make me giggle 
-0YiWWOxSp-SE1hlY7tYjA Harvard Wow they ve been going nuts with the construction where are the 68 foodtrucks Still riddled with my beloved nerds though sigh I spent nine years getting my ass kicked here I ve been gone for 5 and I still really really miss everything about it Thank you sir may I have another Please 
-0_Gy0SqAWDvq1Tu-oiwIg Harvard We tucked ourselves into a corner in the lounge and people watched We had the time since the service though pleasant was just a touch on the slow side The clientele was an interesting mix of well heeled out of towners Rialto is in a hotel after all young Bostonians and older folks that clearly came here twice a month They moved in knots settling at one table for a while to discuss matters of importance while soaking in the hustle and bustle of Harvard Square coming in through the floor to ceiling windows We ordered off the bar menu which showcased Jody Adam s take on how an urban lounge should serve guests Roasted rosemary walnuts and almonds beat any bowl of peanuts I ve ever eaten at a bar The fresh mozzarella was a shade too soft for my tastes I m used to a world in which cheese sits in a tub of cloudy water for about six hours before it gets served but it was dressed nicely The lobster salad sandwich with avocado got the flavor right but the ratios and price were all wrong Most bars around here serve pizza and do a good job of it Rialto s bar pie of the day had pork sausage over a bed of carmelized onions I was pleased with it overall but I felt as if there should ve been more pass with the pepper mill over the top of it The penne bolognese did wonders for my overall experience Meat in pink sauce over pasta I d be hard pressed to find anything at all wrong with that The last few bites of it were what officially put me over into the too full for dessert category but it s a place I like to be We invested just under two hours there all told and would ve been better served if that number was closer to 90 minutes Still it s a lounge and you re supposed to lounge in one The prices were about 10 higher for two people than I thought they would be but that extra goes into the fact that you re renting some high end real estate for a little while Overall the experience was satisfying and I ll be back in short order 
-10v9jC03Et86MPo8lUoTg Harvard Pizza Terrible Seriously among the worst in town Steak Bomb Awesome Seriously ingenious and among the best in town I call it the Steak Bomb paraphrasing Tom Jones I guess but technically it s not called that on the menu It s the Steak and Cheese combo with Sausage or something like that Yes it sounds like an exercise in serious gluttony and it is But it s also good Very good In fact it s the best item on the menu by far and pretty much the only remotely edible thing here in my view The sub roll is soft the cheese is melty it s got mayo and somehow they get the steak and the sausage to come together into perfect greasy meaty harmony I think their secret is that they use loose sausage like you would use to make sausage patties You too can swear off of Hi Fi Pizza forever Join the Steak Bomb club Also if you are female don t go here alone at 2 am It s just too sketchy and I ve heard too many stories 
-15cH98q1xV6w1PiPh7QFw Harvard I finally made it to Rialto the other day and was not disappointed I had high expectations and came away very satisfied with both my food and the service that I received For a first course I had the Field Greens with Pickled Apples and Blue Cheese For my main course I chose the Grilled Sirloin cooked medium rare My steak was perfectly cooked and had great flavor I usually don t spend 43 on an entree but I was glad that I did The rich Chocolate Torta was a decadent way to wrap up the meal I ll definitely be back

-1g_VO_D1Vr-AadwsIdQtQ Harvard Let me begin by saying that the service at the actual bar in Champions was perfectly good and you should not hesitate to meet there with friends for a drink while staying at the hotel That being said five friends and I had the worst breakfast experience there that I can ever recall Several of my friends were in town for our other friend s bachelorette party and found reasonable rates at the hotel On Sunday morning we were all exhausted and everyone was trying to get the show on the road and get home While I have the good fortune of living here everyone else had planes to catch or a long road trip ahead Although the waitress tried to push the 18 buffet we opted to order a la carte for less money and fresher food We knew we were in trouble when it took 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order and bring waters Then the food came with juice and I ordered lemon with my tomato juice She brought us the lemon and no juice When she finally did bring it she brought me orange juice Next we noticed a fly floating in our cream after several of us had already used it in our coffee When we sought a high protein breakfast that wasn t what I had in mind We barely received an apology after we had to dump our coffees and wait some more this time for new cream A half hour later the food was not there approximately one hour after our arrival to a breakfast that we made clear from the beginning needed to go quickly so we could make flights When my friend talked to the manager he was apologetic and said the kitchen was busy although the restaurant looked half full at most but then the waitress joined the conversation and was rude and defensive She then came over to our table and started insisting we eat fruit from the buffet until the food came apparently bacon or eggs would have been too much for us to take When we said we wanted our food and not fruit she became annoyed at US and said well I was just trying to do something for you Note how about you get our food When the food did come my friend s french toast was cold and my other friend who ordered hot sauce with her hash browns never received it for the duration of the breakfast When the breakfast ended the manager came over and announced that he wanted to take care of the bill but could only take care of so much unclear why so he was taking off half As a result of the delay we had to change our plans for getting everyone home by splitting up because there was no time to drive some of us back to our cars and still get the rest of us to the airport As we were walking out the waitress gave us a half hearted apology no doubt as a result of our mentioning to the manager that she had been mad at us when we were the ones who had what was intended to be a speedy breakfast that took more than 1 5 hours Although the manager had told us there were many angry tables when we walked out the place was nearly empty The clear truth was that the kitchen could not handle making breakfast for the demand of a hotel restaurant and instead of handling it professionally the wait staff took out their frustrations by trying to push fruit on the patrons instead of just suggesting up front that if anyone needed to make a flight they had better get the overpriced unimpressive buffet Bottom line go elsewhere Champions is for beers not brunches 
-1hl1PMJ1alTzv0-zfPCEg Harvard OOh where to start Rendezvous in Central Square you saved me last night After being treated like cattle at Tavern in the Square I harrumphed myself and my fiance down Mass Ave to have a little Rendezvous And by rendezvous I mean a nice dinner I had left probably the worst restaurant I have ever been to and not stayed to eat at because the vibe was just so horrible and walked into a haven of food fun and politeness what a surprise We were greeted by the very pleasant hostess who told us that their bar had 2 seats and that you can eat at the bar So that s what we did This bar is comfortable No whacking your knee on an ill made table like at that god awful place I left No loud people standing literally next to you and resting their arm on your table as you perused a TGI Friday s on steriods menu No no At Rendezvous in Central Square you might feel like you stepped into an oasis of culture warmth and good food I got the Saut ed halibut with apple butternut squash smoked bacon sage and cider butter sauce and I literally ate every morsel And I even used a piece of bread to delicately sop up the remaining sage and cider butter sauce and what a sauce it was Priced at 27 00 it is a bit steep for the portion but it is spot on for the quality of this dish I enjoyed it immensely My fiance got the potato gnocchi with foraged mushrooms black truffle piave cheese and for 13 00 this was an exceptional value Again portions were small He also got the turnip soup that he deemed delicious I tried a spoonful but it was not for me But most things aren t Their wine list is extensive and the gentleman who tended bar looked to be extremely well versed in all things alcohol He even tested each drink he made but since I m on the wagon I opted for water and it was Cambridge s finest Seriously if this was tap water it did not taste like it They should bottle this stuff For dessert I got a small cheese plate that was 8 00 it came with a beach plum jelly and raw cow s milk cheese from France some almonds and bread I got a cup of lemon chamomile tea it was perfect I m a tea snob this was some high tea Excellent I am not a fan of Central Square sorry folks But I am a big fan of Rendezvous in Central Square Thanks for saving me Rendezvous 
-1io9QTKoIUDIt77CsaSLQ Harvard Went here late Friday night and had no trouble getting a table for 3 They didn t have the first few beers we ordered The spinach and artichoke dip was like nothing I ve seen before looked like ground up grass or something Tasted a little spicy too so I didn t end up eating any of it but my boyfriend enjoyed it When the waiter found out one of our group was vegan he brought out complimentary salsa to go with the chips Cool decor and nice service

-1riAJFhdNCMuYs9PVPJHQ Harvard I visited Hungry Mother about a month ago and though it took me so long to review it I haven t stopped thinking about it A friend and I had dinner here early on a Friday as reservations are hard to come by Still when I walked in be careful you don t don t walk on by because it only has a small wooden sign demarcating its doorfront from the other houses on the block the hostness said our table was available and led me directly to it To start off I ordered the Bartender s Choice and described a drink that was tart fresh springlike but not overly sweet The waitress brought back something altogether surprising and delicious whiskey with citrus and bitters which tasted exactly as I wanted it to taste What with all the raving we started out with the boiled peanuts which were fun and messy to eat They were well sprinkled with sea salt but since the peanuts were not shelled the salt didn t really permeate all the peanuts leaving some bland We also shared some starters fiddleheads with a soy sauce of some kind and the gnocchi which was delicious but the portion was quite small As a gnocchi lover I m always left wanting more I ordered the pork which was inconsistent one cut was very fatty and flavorless while the other was tender and seasoned and meaty It came with collard greens and grits I loved the greens but even Hungry Mother can t make me like grits I m sorry to say My friend s catfish was perfectly cooked with evenly crispy skin and juicy flaky meat Somehow we still found room for dessert My lemony shortbread with rhubarb came with the tastiest tarragon ice cream I ve ever had The meal ended on a high note but I d have to come back again to see if the entr es will knock it out of the park for me

-2CL5jrnY2ezFBsTz2IBWw Harvard I have a rule Only order stuff on menus that you can t or won t make at home Which is why cheesecake du jour and chocolate cake were my top two choices this afternoon Inside the restaurant Fabulous decor Because of it s plush interior I found myself craving some port wine even though it was only 12 30 PM when I went Then I realized that boozing chocolate would be amazing but I d have to walk home and when I m flopping around in the street screaming Chocolate Aaaaaargggh Delicious cacao bean how you torment my taste buds people won t know that I just had a drink too early in the day they ll think I m a crazy lady Cheesecake Slightly sweet with a nice blueberry flavor Excellent crust overall 4 5 to 5 stars But the Chocolate Cake THE CHOCOLATE CAKE I purposefully didn t take a sip of my water after my last bite just so I could wiggle my tongue around my teeth to find that last little hiding bit of fabulousness wedged in between my molars Absolutely 5 Whenever you go ALWAYS order something chocolate Don t go here for lunch Eat nothing or just a little something and then go for a giant delicious dessert and make someone go with you so you can order two things and try both Yes it s more expensive than Shaws cakes but you can t make this stuff at home I don t care how awesome you think you are Even if it looks like Finale desserts you won t be able to bridge the vast taste canyon 
-2fD9ZE7olWZW7JSnpd-Kg Harvard This place is cheaper than the Boston Mission Some lazy friends from Somerville had me drag my ass across the river for brunch and I m glad I think the breakfast menu topped out at about 4 95 and not 800 00 like the Centre Street Cafe boo hiss I had a delightful omelet with toast and home fries It was great but I would have liked a heads up on the menu saying it would be covered in some GROSS grilled vegetable medley I fucking HATE Mushrooms After picking those off it was super One of my friends ordered her eggs over easy and they were near raw It looked like someone cracked an egg on a hot plate and folded it over I told her to take it home because I was going to make cookies later Plz cook them longer thankiez There wasn t a long wait to to be seated at 2 00 pm on a Sunday I think there was one waitress though After about 10 minutes she asked what we wanted for drinks we wanted to fucking ORDER We were STARVING at that point The menu also has a variety of salads and sandwiches that are double cheap I d totez go here again Our total was 16 for 3 people beverages oh shit I don t think they had ANY kind of liquor mimosas or bloody marys don t forget to flask it 
-2gqhv2lMIwK_N-4TUDLVQ Harvard Born on the Mason Dixon Line Southern food has and will always have a spot in my heart and my stomach I had been dying to come here since the moment I first read about and reading the reviews on yelp just wet my appetite some more It took a blizzard to finally get my bf and I to cross the river and try it Let me start by saying it was worth the dangerous taxi ride It was relatively empty due to the weather conditions but surprising full considering what the sky was doing Our server was great full of helpful recommendations and very attentive We started out with boiled peanuts cheesy grits and the croque monsieur biscuits I could have had appetizers and side dishes as my meal and walked out satisfied and full All three we had were wonderful I ve only ever had grits that good in South Carolina Our main meals were delicious I got a corned beef that was special on the menu and brought over half home for lunch the next day We finished with the sweet potato pie a favorite of mine It came out piping hot don t worry we made sure not a crumb was left Two last things to note the mixed drinks are very good I don t remember what we had but we each liked them And if you go before 6 or 7 and you re seeing a movie at the theater near by they will buy your tickets for you and you ll get them at a discounted rate I cannot wait to back to this one 
-2HDCuavUbDm5XFz0Nw1sA Harvard My fianc and I always go to Passage to India but we decided to try a new Indian restaurant and Cafe of India was A OK I marked down outdoor seating but in reality it s that they open up the whole front of the restaurant so it s outdoor seating without the sun burn Great atmosphere down by Harvard a great place to relax and have a long meal on a sunny afternoon I had the lamb tikka masala and cleared my plate it was all it was that good We also had the garlic naan but I wasn t as much of a fan of it I like Passage to India s more as it is fluffier Service wasn t that great slow and sort of seemed annoyed but the food more than makes up for it Good spot for a date 
-2kJKwJmqaK7UYxefdjmsQ Harvard Love this cozy little place It s great for brunch My favorite are the dirty chai lattes mmm 
-2luynxj9OIGpxkD4c_d4A Harvard 4 stars for friendly service and reliably good and cheap food 
-2LVM7L4CjFjUktQ0npYDA Harvard Handy dandy for printing out my admission ticket to the MTEL teacher exam Hoorah Also handy dandy for printing resumes the night before my interview Time to get our printer installed and running 5 stars no doubt 
-2Lvwxc2eZjQU2hs2VlagQ Harvard Everytime I drop clothing off at the dry cleaners I seem to need a quick turnaround and they are always able to meet my needs The same woman is always working the counter and she spots stains even I have missed when she inspects the clothes I drop off Her honest opinion about whether they can get a stain out is also much appreciated The only negative is that the cost to get womens dress shirts laundered and ironed is a bit expensive 
-2oEWHTYahdxfsmXqU9vqQ Harvard I spend too much time lamenting that things aren t the way they used to be I ll swear for instance that the sun shone brighter in 1994 even though I know this to be demonstrably false With global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer the sun shines brighter now than ever But in my mind the world was much brighter then you could forget all your troubles forget all your cares and wait that s not right Am I channeling Petula Clark again Drat As I was saying before that unfortunate mind fart nothing ever seems to get better in the future and the Garment District is no exception In addition to clothes they also had a killer used book movie and CD department on the ground floor and now it s gone gone gone and crying won t bring it back Dammit there I go again The Garment District is where I once bought a 1960s madras sport coat in excellent condition for eight bucks I wore it for half a summer before I left it on a boat after a booze cruise Or maybe someone threw it in the Harbor I also found a great 1950s Viyella shirt which oddly enough also seems to have disappeared from my wardrobe I still stop in once or twice a year hoping for a 1950s Brooks Brothers suit in my size and I keep my eye out for skinny Ivy League neckties but truly vintage clothing as opposed to moth eaten crap from a dead person s basement gets harder to find with each passing year But as with knights searching for the holy grail or Robert Goulet in Las Vegas this is my quest 
-2Pihjs7klseF376C1EZVA Harvard Beautiful service and food in a quiet tucked away corner 
-2r1gBY0qUdv8sO4Ii79-w Harvard Price of med ice coffee about 12 cheaper than by my house I don t understand the varying prices at dunks but have never really tried to figure out what the deal is with franchises I used to like this place alot more back in the day I have been given BLUEBERRY ICE COFFEE at this location more times than I can count That is the most disgusting flavor of coffee I ve ever experienced I pretty much only like real blueberries to taste like blueberries I like my ice coffee to taste like ice coffee 
-2RZYXLGh9BvljfmECAdGQ Harvard I came here on Boston Marathon Weekend from out of town ready to carbo load for the race The food was really great here sort of your hipster all american country style hefty brunch foods all tasty I split the Eggs Benedict with side of their must have pumpkin pancake dude the pumpkin pancake yes just ONE pancake couldnt be finished between the 2 of us it was bigger than my head and filled with warm spicy pumpkin filling and just the right amount of chocolate morsels melting into the dish At the same time this dish wasn t overloaded with sugar trust me i hate overly sweet dishes for brunch it was just right In addition a tasty butter was served on the side Ordering a side of their Home Fries is an ABSOLUTE must It is SO good If you want this dish on steriods order the Omar Platter it s the Home fries and then some Whatever they do to flavor their potatoes has a standout flavor well spiced I also absolutely LOVE their coffee I asked what they served and turns out it s a local brew from the New Hampshire Brewing Company Totally need to go online and order their means Lastly their artsy laid back atmosphere just makes it a hotspot to gather together with friends for brunch for cozy conversation I love this place 
-2tFc4qiRRM6xyE0lqS1gA Harvard Got this hotel off of Priceline com and it was a steal We paid about 140 for the room and it came with a beautiful view on the 17th floor The check in desk is super speedy and friendly The location is literally right in front of the Kendall station which is very convenient If it wasn t for the online deal I doubt my boyfriend and I would have stayed here Also minus 1 star for the area lacking in choices of restaurants bars there s just tons of office buildings 
-2VXWjv_9lezmHOQRZZPoA Harvard Still love Chris and all the staff and Asa just got a new haircut I m often pretty boring in my hairstyle choices and it looks GREAT and Chris did EXACTLY what I wanted The highlights are amazing as usual Most of the world thinks it is real blonde hair Cannot recommend Chris and Asa more highly 
-2Wld4W3ymXYiA2ktX-RwA Harvard It s too expensive but i enjoy the concept Apparently they have a damn good burger but i didn t go that route The whole healthy eating concept can be maintained here but may be blown by the buffet style eating I enjoyed it but it was an experience not really a repeat customer type thing 
-2z7JmX595zRVaI3MvbZ8A Harvard So far just a review of lunch I had long avoided F I amidst complaints it was too pricey or too gimmicky And because I was a vegetarian Well I finally hit the place up for lunch and I have to say I m a fan The little tagline of improvisational dining or interpretive dining or whatever may have made me want to retch but not the food and not the pricing Still I think cafeteria style hibachi might be closer to truth Here the main clarification that would have helped me figure out F I before I got there Most people say it s all you can eat while some folks complain about being charged for an extra bowl of food Well they re both right but it s the best of both worlds you start with a bowl for 7 95 which is smallish but can hold a great deal of food if you pile it on right Then if that bowl and a plate from the included salad bar and the rice and tortillas they bring to the table aren t enough to sate you you can convert the whole thing to endless trips for 3 more You don t have to decide first and you can easily get an obscene amount of food for 8 Just to emphasize you certainly don t as some people made it sound pay for an all you can eat situation but then get charged for additional trips That s just crazy talk It is gimmicky as evidenced by the fact that they had to give it a kitschy tag But that gimmick includes endless customization options Pick your veggies pick your starches pick your meats pick your sauce Or skip the veggies because there s a salad bar and skip the starches because you get rice and tortillas That s a honkin huge pile of meat for 8 and a good variety to choose from There was a good variety of sauces as well though the teriyaki I ended up with thinking I was playing it safe for my first time there was actually pretty bad There s also a sandwich burger option that seems to operate similarly but which I did not investigate But if the concept of an 11 all you can eat burger bar with all the fixins appeals to you by all means ask if that s really how it works I ll try to remember to ask when I go back and update here 
-3-sjrWsQs1ASOHDHmF_PA Harvard Come on John they re not that bad I catch more stuck up idiots at foot locker Fact is that the sneaker game is so bullS t it is now primarily made up of little kids that were 2 years old when these HOT originals were released it s the thing to do man nothing is sacred 
-32TEBuzbdTixsn0iVJ6mQ Harvard It may not be gourmet but I always have a good time at Border Cafe We go there for a laid back and fun atmosphere that does not end up costing us a fortune The only downfall the crowd and the wait Sometimes it is outrageous But I would wait to have the delicious corn and black bean empanadas As for the margaritas They are sub par but you pay for what you get If you want a fine dining experience I don t know why you would end up at Border Cafe in the first place 
-33nPb4ntPYdJWkfsH4MPw Harvard Two of my friends and I were traipsing around Newbury St one sunny late morning window shopping and generally just enjoying the beautiful weather When somebody decided it was time for a meal and when somebody else decided it was too late for breakfast oops we stopped by Cafe 47 on a whim to get some lunch The decor inside is immediately striking somehow combining a red brick Italian pizza place atmosphere with a hip cocktail sipping abstract art on the wall feel in a way that s not completely discordant We were quickly seated the place was almost empty at 1pm on a Wednesday and our waitress was quick and friendly although I suspect she was relatively new to the place The menu is probably best described as modern Italian American bistro fare with paninis sandwiches salads and desserts and was neither overwhelming nor overly sparse We all ordered the lunch special which included a soda half of a panini and a salad for the extremely reasonable price of 8 Our food wound up being quite good with the best part being the Poached Pear Salad with candied walnuts bleu cheese a vinaigrette and delicious pieces of poached pear The paninis with well made though unremarkable Overall a great place to get lunch especially with the 8 lunch special I look forward to returning soon 
-35f__B4afF9iH-RYGFcOQ Harvard Ok I can understand the love of this place for margaritas but unless you plan on only getting that one drink because the daiquiri s suck I would suggest finding any location other then this one for Mexican Hell even Anna s may be better The real question remains how can you mess us a drink A blended ice ridden daiquiri was what I was served The salad not bad until the meat came which was like a sponge with jerk flavoring that was too spicy for human consumption unless you burned them all off at the ripe age of 5 Second the rub put on the chicken makes it impossible for a human to recognize food underneath the blackened mess How it is served I will not know I do know that the drink came in handy after a taste test The reason for those 2 stars the staff was nice and it was fun to look at the walls the drink even lacking in luster wasn t bad the best par the salsa try it sometime with a drink but nothing else However it was a waste of time and I think taco bell would serve better mexican 
-38MDZwGe1dJv_Si-6tLJg Harvard This review is solely for the lunch barbecue on the patio And the first word that comes to my lips is drumroll please Deeef nlicious This is by far the best lunch deal in Kendall For nine bucks you get an amazing slab of meat two delicious sides and a drink It s so fresh and so clean clean right off the grill Bonus points for the free watermelon to top off the meal With choices of lemonade and iced tea feel free to mix yourself a perfect for summertime Arnold Palmer kick back on the brick patio and enjoy the sunshine and the delicious food I highly recommend the salmon Yum The only downside to this place is the plastic plates utensils It really lowers the meal a notch and makes me feel uberguilty because there is no recycling bin as well Blue Room let s see some legit silverware and place settings I m not asking for fine China but your food quality deserves proper presentation Or at least a recycling bin 
-3bVg0ymQjaT3rvPdl9Oew Harvard Went here for the first time tonight Shocking I know I m an MIT grad It was worth the trip in the bitter cold Saw Up in the Air with a group of friends Excellent movie excellent company excellent theater It s a very clean very well run locale It might seem odd to describe a movie theater in terms of atmosphere but I like the vibe of this location It has a small cozy feel with a trendy yet classic flair I also like that they show indie movies I m looking forward to going back here 
-3OZuAzob1Xezkzzf8zDPw Harvard I ve been told by several local residents that this is the best take out delivery pizza place in the Cambridge area Because Toscanini s is next door I d opted for ice cream instead of real food at Cinderella s until the other day We had take out at 10pm on a Saturday One star for being open until at least 1am every night of the week and having high quality food at any hour The croutons on the ceasar salad were homemade possibly bits of their garlic bread and they were delicious as was the dressing Another star and a half for that The onion rings were thickly breaded perfectly round and abundant Half a star for accuracy The pizza the crust was clean and chewy and fresh tasting it wasn t overcooked and crunchy and it almost tasted like they used purified water or something that sorta felt like the culinary equivalent of a warm face cloth Another star The toppings were all fresh no canned nothing plentiful and wonderfully proportioned to the cheese and delicious sauce The fifth and absolutely deserved star For bonus points add that it s a family owned business that has metered parking around the block and a nice ambience for highly affordable and delectable pizza 
-3Sunx9cH_c7K9mb0dJXIg Harvard Could go here twice a week oh wait I do I recommend the lamb and the Falafel 
-3tXPyHq00eqKs-vMqZ_Zg Harvard Lord Hobo has a solid beer list and delicious food It s worth the hassle to park and the journey all the way to Cambridge Hobo has a pretty big bar but there are also quite a few tables It s a great place to get dinner or just a few beers Everything on their food menu looks awesome so it was really hard to decide on one thing for dinner I settled on the Mac and cheese which was served in a flaming hot skillet and was tasty I m glad that s the entree that I selected I shared the polenta fries as an appetizers and I actually wish that I had gotten one for myself For dinner They were UNREAL and I will proceed to order me every time I go back The lights are usually fairly dimmed so it has a great ambiance However it can be a little hard to read the menus especially when there are so many beers to choose from at least 2 pages The bartenders know all abut the beers on tap which is refreshing 
-3UWCSyxQ7PodrdTRSdUxQ Harvard There is nothing here I want and yet I want to die on the ramp The garage is old and dirty and takes me wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy back IT s not about the stores here they re generally not worth it in my NTLBFHO it s about the vibe of the building It s so chill and awesome and that little body jewelry place in the middle So random and yet so perfect I heart the garage even the nasty ass bathrooms Who am I kidding ESPECIALLY the nasty ass bathrooms 
-3XOnlFYnczLLDcFKi8qzQ Harvard 7 minutes for a pressed sandwich i ll take this wait any time The food here is wonderful especially for one of the pressed paninis I love the atmosphere the selection of sandwiches and the coffee The staff always seems like they are having a good time and it makes me want to work here The prices are a bit steep but I think it is def worth it Grab you sandwich find a bench outside and enjoy 
-3yOk60WTx5SkmSCqF_s1g Harvard Awesome food great drinks Try the green burger or the chicken under a brick Both are excellent The Perfect Storm with its 5 year rum and ginger beer mixture is the perfect drink compliment to any meal Came here for Valentine s Day and it was surprisingly not busy The atmosphere was pretty good even though they were stuck on an early 90s rock metal lite music playlist The only reason I bring it up was that it didn t seem to fit the decor nor what I would imagine are their target clientele I can t complain though and it didn t spoil dinner in the least We were able to talk eat drink and just have a great night out They didn t rush us through dinner they seemed pretty happy to just have us sit chill for a bit Overall a really fun night 
-42fpmotKeS-NwtlU4gLqw Harvard Now I ve always been a huge fan of Chipotle but today made me an even bigger fan When I went in to order my usual steak burrito they were out of steak for about 60 seconds time The manager then gave me the burrito for free along with a free drink Easily the most refreshing customer service experience I ve had in years Thank you Chipotle for restoring my faith in man kind 
-4gJYBJnk9QjMakpFwsUag Harvard This spot sits in Harvard Square and is a nice after dinner treat with some pretty good drink recipes and nicely done desserts The menu offers all sorts of selections and some good after dinner wines toddies and coffees The prices are reasonable and the service is friendly and fast The decor is pretty cool and it was a real nice spot to venture after a meal and the hours are open late so there is no worry about closing time 
-4oeC4ipfb7IOVxZ81p9Ng Harvard Disgusting That a place serves alcohol does not in itself justify more than one star 
-4Og_I53HqWvWH6zHvbgoA Harvard The beats were bumpin while the dancers were poppin If you are in the know in terms of hip hop freestyle dancing then you were at the MiddleSex lounge last night It was a free flow all love for all dancers from all types of backgrounds You have master b boys tearin up the floor Losst Unnown crew to newbies learning the ropes of hip hop dancing Everyone is welcomed and the more you participate the more enthusiastic claps and shout outs you get It s a great place to learn enjoy and love freestyle hip hop I completely forgot we were in the heart of MIT and thought I was back at an underground hip hop joint back home Oh the drinks are priced moderately vodka tonic 7 and the bartenders definitely mastered their craft They get you in and out of the bar area in a couple of minutes Well done fellas Great spot for a Thursday night Check it check it out Yo 
-4v37mHr2Ev_rT-aMdCBdQ Harvard Awesome outdoor roof deck best I have been to in the Boston area in some time though it did not have those gas heat lamps that so many outdoor places have which means on even a warm day the area gets a bit cool when the sun goes down A great space indoor and out solid menu with good basics but nothing really over the top burgers stuffed chicken a couple of fish selections etc Prices are also pretty average ranging in that 15 25 per entree area The service was the only blemish really The host staff was rude and the waitress wasn t rude per sey just kind of cold It didn t help that she dropped half a glass of red wine on my white shirt and then didnt even bother to take said glass of wine off of the bill which seemed to me like it should have been a pretty standard thing I mean her sloppiness ruined a 40 shirt so comping me a 9 glass of wine would have been nice 
-4x24Ub932tc7QZ5Y9_6sw Harvard If you are a strict vegetarian vegan or have specific food no nos Fire and Ice is not the place for you Because everything is cooked on one giant stove by a pair of old looking twins food constantly gets mixed together Everyone can expect to find pieces of food from their neighbor s bowl Overall the food is ok It s typically quite crowded so it can get loud The sauce can be quite heavy in flavor Don t feel obliged to fill the little cup with sauce Also you can request to have cheese added on top of your food or burger Also keep an eye on your food because they will always ask which set is yours while they are cooking If you don t know they ll add the wrong sauce to your food or they ll add your sauce to the wrong food 
-4_UIw4QhgM3IfUJ5ZSjpA Harvard You know how authentic Mexican joints sometimes have pictures of Mexico on the wall This place has pictures of authentic Mexican restaurants on the wall And that about sums up what this burrito joint is about Authenticity aside these burritos are pretty tasty The guacamole and pico de gallo are fresh and delicious and they are included in the price of most of the burritos The fillings are also tasty especially the spicy chicken Extra star for having a complimentary salsa bar The green salsa verde and onion cilantro mix are the perfect accompaniment to any burrito 
-50HnKnKYRTMoJxidZhD7g Harvard Do you like your homefries to come from fresh rather than frozen potatoes Do you like your omelets cooked in cast iron pans with butter rather than on teflon pans with some kind of ozone eating lubricant Do you like your grits home cooked for hours instead of poured out of cardboard box If yes the finest breakfast in all of Boston can be had here Plus it s reasonably priced and only really crowded on weekends They don t lie when they call the cooking fresh and honest Would be a homerun if they served loose leaf tea and kept the coffee a bit hotter Screw that Even with drab tea selection it s a home run and easy five star It s a bit on the fancy side with lots of power brokers and Harvard celebrities munching away But if you can get over that and don t mind eating breakfast off a freshly laundered table cloth you ll be in pig heaven 
-52YbNhC4AmqxIEmEL6RjA Harvard The first time I had Lyndell s veggie pizza I thought I was still at Carberry s they hadn t repainted or changed the sign yet but I was SO pleased with the food While I still haven t forgiven them for going white bread on Carberry s outrageous and wonderful orange and purple paint job everything I ve had at Lyndell s is fantastic I love their lobster tail it s a pastry their hot chocolate and toady I tried a tuna with mixed greens cucumber tomato carrots smoked gouda bean spread and pesto on their focaccia I could not have been happier 7 49 Best sandwich in Central Square 
-54IgPIY8Mr2saCW1QYC2g Harvard I ve had a couple of the little cupcakes from Sweet before which were shared with me by friends I liked them but I ve really wanted to go in the store to get the whole Sweet experience Today I finally went in during my lunch break After having a salad at the Trident I thought a cupcake wouldn t hurt I also had my camera with me and really wanted to get a good cupcake pic The place was empty at the time except for the woman working behind the counter She was super nice I decided to forgo the cupcake with the heaps of frosting and jelly beans on top even though I would have loved to buy one just to take a picture of it I got a chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting that had coconut on top I put it down on the table and took a couple of shots of it before gobbling it down Yummmmerific It was even tastier than it looked I thanked the nice cupcake lady and left A few minutes later I returned to get some for my bosses workstudy They loved them I will come back here anytime I need a sweet treat 
-56nxIlcL2jxaP5nY8mMSQ Harvard I have been to cafe Luna almost every weekend since the start of the year so at least 20 times for their weekend Brunch and I still have a fantastic time every time I go The specifics of why it s so good everyone else has covered really well and you just need to try it words are not enough

-5aqYb5ZP0pErO1OWY0cYA Harvard Bartley s is a gimmick Best place for burgers they are not But definitely worth a try just for the experience It s loud crowded and you will probably have to share a table with strangers As far as the food the burgers are big and juicy with ample toppings I d say they are okay but really not worth the money As for the fries the regular ones are good The sweet potato ones were extremely soggy Not impressed In summary its a good place to bring tourists or to try at least once However it s expensive 25 30 for 2 people for what you get and the food isn t the best quality 
-5BxH4LuoRbRcrbG-4Aw2w Harvard Hungry Mother I effing love you I don t even want kids and I would totally have like 10 of your babies I would love to find a way to concoct that wonderful 55 cocktail at home That and the fried green tomatoes and the ham on a biscuit with red pepper jelly and now I m making myself hungry Pretty please think about being open for lunch if even just a kickass Sunday brunch sometime in the near future just a thought 
-5kJPWsmHmUMEXvyBkdfqw Harvard The only reason this place lost a star was because of the long wait but how can they help it when their food is so amazing Pancakes Huge and amazing Egg Sandwiches on thick slices of the homemade bread of your choosing are you kidding me Unreal Love Not to mention I washed this down with the BEST Irish Coffee of my life Order it Seriously

-5o_ffhxQnH2SZOIlcHTqQ Harvard So in this update I m giving Lord Hobo five stars for being awesome minus one star for being so expensive Why you ask A review of our finances from this winter should answer both questions The truth is that in February we spent more money at Lord Hobo than we did on groceries Yowch I think perhaps we like too much 
-5PuIIBULCYeflhLEiDEcA Harvard I pass Au Bon Pain everyday on my way to work and if I didn t have time for breakfast at home i ll grab a quick bite here The muffins are good and the chai is also a good bet Lately I ve been trying to spend my money at restaurants that offer great food and service but also offer a more environmentally sustainable dining experience So I ve been mainly eating at green certified restaurants but unfortunately there are way too few in Boston so unless I want to be eating at the same handful of places everyday I m trying to encourage my faves to think about becoming certified Not just for me but for other ppl who i m sure care too and ultimately for the environment 
-5WitNw28MNLzyBQc6Su2w Harvard Went here with a few friends for brunch and it was great paid around 29 and had a delicious plate or two of food and of course dessert I d say go here but go early it gets crowded 
-5XsNrPc6nbuaUkBiQkoow Harvard This is good cupcakes right here I like desserts I love desserts that are not too sweet and therefore just right A little extra sugar is the biggest dealbreaker for me That s mainly why I like Sweet The place smells good inside unlike Kickass Cupcakes which reeks of a dairy farm And Sweet is also pretty everything from the white tables and chairs to the wallpapers and even the lovely brown cardboard boxes are so sweet Ahh what can I say The Red Velvet here is ace not too sweet The banana split cupcake which I believe is a seasonal offering is just perfect There s also the boston cream pie c cake omg so good They have such a lovely assortment of cupcakes here which taste just right I also love that they have small paper cups of icing available for sale how cute And the best part the shop is just a minute from the Hahvahd Squway T station This is my new go to place for my cupcake cravings 
-5Z6wcI-Ag5WhJP1ileJeg Harvard By far the best meal we ve had in the Boston area in a long time From the wait staff to the environment to the food to the drinks the place was top of its game We had a hightop table across from the kitchen were we could see all the action and everything that was plated made us want to order it We had the tasting menu and the favors got bigger and bolder as we moved through the meal I also need to call out the cocktails as they made the night We had a cocktail flight which meant we were able to sample 4 cocktails along with our meal I would strongly reco you try this as it was the perfect way to try drinks you might not order yourself Fantastic night 
-63DbLBHgquu1P71i6RngQ Harvard I used to think that you could not make a bad cupcake but I was wrong This place is terrible And its not the service to me its the cake I got the honey lemon and bf got the peach cobbler The flavor of honey lemon was on the verge of being a good cupcake but the cake fell short Dry as last years Texas summer Frosting was ok but a lil gritty not that smooth velvety taste it should have Bf s peach cobbler cupcake was a lot better but at that price point 3 25 I m expecting it to be better than Georgetown cupcakes I won t be recommending this place soon to any of my peeps coming to Boston

-6AYm4VeQR0KMoWqv32DWg Harvard Review Summary Emma the original owner was aggressive and rude Sadly the current owner is agressive and rude and also has a terrifying temper The food is excellent but stay away from Emma s unless you re willing to check your self respect at the door To begin with some history for those of you more recent immigrants to Cambridge Emma s is a Cambridge institution The original Emma s was up in West Cambridge in a small storefront in Huron Village Emma was a notoriously unpleasant Italian woman who I remember being intensely afraid of as a child because she would yell at people who came in There were two pizza joints on Huron Ave then Emma s and the still surviving Armando s Every pizza night local Cantabrigians faced an awful conundrum brave Emma s wrath to get the best pizza in town thin crust and perfectly peppery before all that was hip or go see Armando who was kind to children supported little league and made deeply unremarkable pies Emma s Pizza was excellent but you couldn t be certain she would let you stay We learned young not to send the weird looking kid to get the slices she might refuse to give them to him Anyway after Emma passed away I was please that her fine pizza was reincarnated into a hip creative new eatery in Kendall Square with a seemingly much better attitude I ve had many happy meals at the new Emma s Their pizza is delectable the tuna melt is luscious and their basic salad is one of my favorites get the red wine vinaigrette excellent advice I took from the friendly silver haired waitress Also they have beer Okay so why give Emma s one star you ask Well today at Emma s was first time I ve been thrown out of anywhere a first I didn t expect would happen over iced teas at a lunch with my father to discuss my wedding plans Here s what happened We walked in got a table for 2 and ordered teas from the nice waitress My dad asked for the BLT and I went for my fave salad with chicken All was going well as we sipped our drinks and fell deep into a discussion about the wedding band It is relevant here that I have a connective tissue disorder that causes irritation in my joints and makes it difficult for me to sit in chairs for long periods of time so I m fidgety and I often as I did today slip off one flip flop and nestle a foot into my lap to relieve my knee pain As we talked I was unconsciously sitting this way Suddenly a tall guy with dark hair interrupts our conversation and with no preamble or introduction points down and say you need to put on your shoes I felt kind of flustered by this A little confused I pointed to my other food securely on the ground and in my shoe and stammered something about how I wasn t barefoot I just had one foot in my lap He repeated I said put your shoes on now and then walked abruptly away I had no objection to doing so but would it have killed him to just ask nicely Now the sensible thing would have been to stick my foot in my shoe and just grumble over my salad but I don t like to leave things with bad feelings and I felt he d been really rude about something that there was no reason not to be polite and friendly about So I got up and walked in my shoes of course to where the man was talking to another guy I said Excuse me I d like to talk to you about what just happened Now seriously the guy just exploded There is nothing to talk about he said loudly That s why it says no shirt no shoes no service so if you don t want to wear your shoes you can get out And he continued angrily it was incredibly rude of you to interrupt my conversation so I think you should leave Suddenly literally for asking to talk to him I was being thrown out Wow At this point things get a little fuzzy Voices are raised he walks back into the dining room I follow my dad has reared up in daddy grizzly mode and has started in Now look here I ve been coming to this restaurant for 30 years and Dark haired man was having none of it Well you won t be coming here any more he yelled Get out of my restaurant now The dining room is small and everyone was staring I m thinking ohmigod why is he yelling at us At this point I m sorry to say we kind of lost it too I m not proud My dad let loose a shocking M F bomb which caused the guy to yell to his staff to call 9 11 We started to walk out but I couldn t help lecturing the silent room about how he had kicked us out for no reason because they were looking at us in horror Sorry other diners I know we seemed like jerks at the end there but aggressive and mean is no way to run a restaurant The proprietor took a cell phone photo of us for his surely extensive wall of local undesirables I guess we ve now entered the criminal class of people who fidget and don t like to be treated poorly

-6gDqbVc3tegK-ym98OkSA Harvard Cadillac fajitas and Cajun popcorn we have a date Friday night Don t make me wait too long ok I ve tried just about everything on this menu and have never been disappointed except for one time bones came in my catfish one incident in over 5 years of yumminess hardly counts Especially for the prices Unlike many restaurants I frequent this is one of the few places I ll experiment Generally I go to the same establishment for the same thing Indeed many places all over town could probably recite an order of mine This Friday it ll be what has come to be my favorites but truly many things have satisfied me here 
-6hL4N9VCgyuj-6M_wIe8g Harvard So you took her on a date Why not Not the prettiest girl in the world but she laughed at your lame joke and there was something about the way she twirled her hair So the date went well And so did the second Didn t get past second base but meh there was just something about the way she smiled at you You think Maybe it s just because she lives just down the street Or maybe its cause she always answers the door even if it s 2am in the morning You don t know hell most of the time you go see her the room s spinning from one to many at Redline or Middlesex Lounge and you can t be bothered to think about why s and hows Until suddenly you re walking down the aisle and her gap toothed smile catches the corner of your eye from under her veil and you think to yourself how did it come to this And you know it s gonna be lamb roll ups for the rest of your life Yep Moody s is kind of like that 
-6HYPfrLZq-4uL67H6K1-g Harvard Yeah I may be addicted to the chickpea fritter Also the service is excellent The staff actually knows me by name Not too shabby for a food truck I ve tried most of the other sandwiches but always come back to the chickpea fritter Not a massive fan of the rosemary fries They don t have that crunch I m looking for I m not a vegetarian but will eat here a lot Nice job Plus nutritional information is on their website 
-6ojzFIBAhlT9CMzeiVTYg Harvard When we moved to Boston for 6 months due to my husbands sabbatical leave we sent our 3 year old to Bright Horizons University Park IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE Bright Horizons behind its fancy name and advertisement was an okay daycare not really a preschool they claim to be but without any joy and loving atmosphere There was only one teacher Kyla who helped our son to adept to his new school We still do not know what she is doing there As our son liked her we decided to stay with the school despite its shortcomings After two months we received a call from the school that another kid hit our son with a tricycle and his knee is swollen We wish that it was the only problem When we went to hospital and x ray was taken we were informed that his femur bone was fractured and he was put in a body spica cast He stayed in the cast for 7 weeks and it has been three weeks that he is out of the cast he has just started walking It was a big accident in a school garden We do not think it is an accident it was negligence of the school because teachers are supposed to make sure such accidents never happen I also think they do not teach kids proper behavior a sense of being a class and just keep them busy all day After the accident one manager from the regional headquarters and one person from their risk department talked to my husband that s all very corporate with no real sense of care After the accident we did not get any call from the family of the child who hit my son I am not sure but my hunch is they did not even inform his family If this had been a real preschool one would expect the teachers to have the class prepare a get well soon card or something to that effect to teach the class empathy at least No such thing was done STAY AWAY FROM BRIGHT HORIZONS 
-6OT7LV-BTnGKb1ymiqCAg Harvard Good coffee by the Boston Cambridge standard Can t say much about their food I bet they are average In fact if you have a lot of time to wait in line watching people working over the counter I bet Carberry s have better options for baked goods If you have a lot of time to wait in line watching people talking and screaming but not working I also know where to go the only coffee shop run by commies in the hood you know 
-6s5Lh5kMy9Uxxla67LQ3w Harvard Very cool atmosphere beautiful decorations felt like we were in an art nouveau painting Lovely hostess and wait staff very fun and friendly We ordered the lobster and avacado duck l orange steak fried artichokes and some cocktails Everything couldn t have been more delicious and came to our table so fast The cocktails were lovely all prohibition themed and tasty and we even had an after dinner shot It was served in a crazy bottoms up shot glass that the waitress described the history of All in all would love to go here any old time or for a special occasion Two thumbs way up 
-6wYLAWaA1GoNK7Bql8XZA Harvard Every type of tea you might imagine I have too many favorites to list them all but one should try the green vanilla When you get off your coffee kick come here for some tea Limited seating and no restrooms are a bummer All else is great 
-6yZ-3E9y7wmdtocLykfYA Harvard The weather outside was frightful Dec 19 2008 but there was no way I was going to miss my company s holiday party at the Charles Hotel I chose to play it safe by booking a room at a ridiculously low rate even though I live just 4 miles away That s right 4 miles But that could be a very dangerous 4 miles when there s a blizzard outside Boy were we glad we had the room Instead of racing around after work and before the party the BF and I took a nap on the luxurious bed in our standard room read some of the magazines in the room Atlantic monthly anyone and admired the views The room was delightful and cozy though I was a little confused by the country cum modern look they were going for There were definitely a few things different about this hotel It seems like they thought to themselves what do people really need in a hotel where they ll probably just be staying a few nights They had metal keys Like real metal No coffeemaker in the room No ice maker on the floor you could call for complimentary ice No dresser really Minibar was in the desk and had a tricky little key hidden in the envelope you get when you arrive There was a TV in the mirror Amazing Really cool real clock on the wall You could touch it and it would stop the gears from spinning not that i did that Really I swear The bed faced the windows which was cool Most hotels have the bed perpendicular to the windows Room especially compared to downtown Boston hotel rooms The ballroom where we had the party was nice pretty anonymous Service was great The buffet was good though I definitely preferred the standard fare of beef and potatoes versus the gourmet pastas and seafood which are normally my favorites I don t know how Meghan P managed to go to Henrietta s Table when she was in college the food is delicious but not cheap For those out of towners the Charles Hotel is right near the subway the T and close to the river Definitely a good place to base your Boston Cambridge visit And in the summer you can sit at the outdoor Legal Seafoods bar or visit the farmer s market and in the winter you can ice skate Win win Overall we had a great stay I want to book a room every year for our holiday parties 
-6zwjZ0lMQM4XiSm8v2nUw Harvard I went to the Kendall last Sunday for a matinee of Please Give Overall it was a pleasant experience but the popcorn usually fresh and quite tasty on most visits was stale as though it had been popped the day before and kept overnight under a 40 watt bulb I highly recommend the movie itself which is consistent with the Kendall s programming vibe quirky provocative challenging off Hollywood fare Believe me any theater committed to screening the complete Cremaster cycle by Matthew Barney coming up in June is worth patronizing fresh popcorn or not 
-7-oSbBuo30Om3S7biaUlg Harvard I have been here a couple of times I go back for sentimental reasons My now husband and I had our first date there We went there again last night I love the margaritas The food is ok Nothing great tex mex and canjun kind of mex Not the authenitic kind of food but good and filling I love the chips and salsa Warm and salty goodness If you go at the right time you can get seated right away before about 5 30 or 6 at night otherwise expect a wait The waitstaff and mgmt has always been attentive 
-70iz_mHQ-Kq97OVpauQVA Harvard Monday night karaoke is a blast Way better than anyplace else in Boston They have an unlimited music selection more than any other karaoke we have been to The staff was awesome and the atmosphere was fun Drinks and apps were very reasonably priced and fed the whole table for under twenty They even give away a 50 00 gift card at the end of the night I hope they expand to other days of the week 
-7BESyqzo17QBlz8ePSxSw Harvard Decided to try out this place since we have never been here before The boxes for their cupcakes seemed to cute Sweet cake cupcake with vanilla frosting cake was good but I was overdosed by frosting It was a ton of frosting for a small cake Mocha Mint Chip cupcake was ok it was too much frosting but the flavor composition was pretty good Pupcake our canine companion loved her dog cupcake She scuffed it down in 5 minutes So I think Sweet might just be her favorite bake shop 
-7cM1Uxli_V--IRs99es0w Harvard How Major Moments of My Life Might ve Been Different If I d Had a Burrito From Anna s at My Side BIRTH The doctor tells my mother to push and there I am crowning My dad faints at the sight of my bloody bald head but he has revived by the time she s pushed out the afterbirth covered foil tube We are both the same length Once I am swaddled the nurse unwraps the silvery foil of the tube It is still warm but the tortilla is a little dry FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL I cry The kids are all much bigger than I am and the teacher a woman with a heavy accent that I barely understand has little patience for the timid little girl At lunch time I sneak off into the corner and unwrap my burrito The guacamole is soothing One of the kids has tortilla chips and we trade parts of our meals I make a friend FIRST KISS It s 10 at night and he s dropping me off after a fun afternoon of ice skating We can barely see one and other by the light of the moon and he misses moist lips grazing the edge of my mouth Burritos in hand our breath smells like onions and the spiciness burns our lips This feeling in my stomach is like salsa butterflies I feel like dancing We grin and try again GRADUATION It s raining and I don t want to be there but my parents put their foot down and demanded that photo op The general atmosphere is one of weary victory The nonstop stream of names goes on for hours and I praise myself for thinking ahead and bringing lunch Of course I spill oil down the front of my robe luckily it s too dark to catch in the photos On my way back to my seat I step in a puddle and accidentally splash my diploma with mud It ll be a great story later LOSING VIRGINITY I didn t realize I would be so hungry after sex Nor did I realize how annoyed I would be when he just rolls over and goes to sleep after he comes leaving me feeling strangely empty My burrito is on the nightstand and I quickly unwrap it and tear savagely at it savoring the feeling of sating physical hunger When he finally wakes back up for another go it s not nearly as fulfilling as that burrito But it is more fun FIRST TIME EATING ANNA S Uh yeah this is kind of the same 
-7eG2WInjLQPfSEBmwqiJA Harvard Horrible got food poisoning GI upset a few hours after the meal so I can naturally only think to blame this place Also we were seated next to a crying baby and when we asked to be re seated we were seated right next to the cash register waiters bump in to you 
-7gPp4ehu213OyNl4fCDUQ Harvard Dear Middle East I love you You re an institution and you deserve your acclaim But please please PLEASE fix the sound in the ME Upstairs room If the band playing the room has more than three instruments the sound turns to mush I don t think it s the fault of the resident sound guy I put the fault squarely in your lap s Don t be like TTs 
-7nkH6oUki2icbpFkvyayA Harvard Lenny gave me the worst haircut I ve had in years He didn t seem to care at all about how the cut came out As far as I can tell he decided what cut to give me and then went on autopilot executing it not paying attention to how it fit my face as he went at all When he was done he didn t even bother styling it As much as I try to find virtue in it even weeks later the cut just looks cheap I ll certainly never go back again 
-7uEIO3nw7bEb9i77W2eMQ Harvard Hey how s it going Good morning Is there something I can get for you puts envelope to head a la Johnny Carson Things you will never hear at Carberry s I go here most weekday morning s because I work across the street at whole foods Maybe it s because i m there at 6 30am but I don t think so I can be nice and cordial when it s still dark out why can t you Nasty manners aside their coffee blows I don t know anything about their pastries I m sure they re bitter and pointy 
-7WJxo83DmKOOFsI_vfzbw Harvard Went here for dinner one night It was good and cheap The restaurant seems a bit crowded with tables and has 3 sections We were seated down stairs near some windows and it was a bit cramped if anyone wanted to get up The fresh summer rolls were delicious Entree I had flat noodles with tofu It was greasy but overall okay I probably should have went with a noodle bowl but I was not too disappointed I would give it another shot My sister was pleased with her dish The menu offers many options The portions are large especially for the price Everything was fresh when we went The service was fine The bill was cheap I d come back again but not expecting top notch food 
-86AkryqAFo3mAy5rWg7dA Harvard Not liking this one as much Go to Kendall Sq if you have to go to a Doyle s I do like the design of the place Multi floors is great What I don t like is the staff I ve never had an issue personally but the guy who runs the security Teddy is a straight up jackass Basically he s unable to get on cambridge police but believes he s the law around the area Brags about how his roommate is a Cambridge Police Officer except the word from CPD officers is that neither have warm feelings towards them from CPD Oh and while most bouncers are there to watch over the general safety of the bar You re more likely to be creepily and aggressively sexually harassed by the bouncers than you are by the patrons Not cool Also have witnessed while at another bar multiple bouncers from doyle s actually leave Tommy Doyle s to track down and threaten some guy at another bar for something stupid Way to do your job Who was watching over Doyle s then I suggest Kendall Sq location to avoid the pervy bouncers with authority issues Basically the Doyle s security staff make their bar an unpleasant experience for many but then they also like to spread their wealth of sex offenderish behavior and aggressive attitudes to the neighboring bars as well 
-8AEOyETPl71o3sgLkbbiQ Harvard The layout of this place is baffling to me and it changes every two days The number of times I ve gotten lost Limited soda and junkfood selection dismal makeup isle and the self checkouts are ALWAYS telling you to wait for assistance They do have one awesome clerk and by awesome I mean out of her mind who strikes up such intensely personal conversation you kind of feel bad cutting it off and getting the hell out But not really Unfortunately it being CVS and next to the T I can t not patronize

-8QYDANPG1fZFHIURSYouA Harvard I ve only been here once but I thought the hot chocolate was too sweet and too thick It tasted like it needed to be watered down A LOT But if that s what you like in a hot chocolate then this is the place for you The chocolates are adorable to look at but I didn t think they were worth it for the price Also it s so hyped up that it was pretty crowded and there were no empty tables when I went It looks like a really cute place to go on a date or to catch up with friends especially during the winter but I didn t think it was all that worth it 
-9Aj4xLWyHGHLApVgKGDow Harvard The Kendall is technically part of a chain but there s something distinctly Cantabrigian about it Equal parts independent film and multiplex this theater also houses special events like the Boston Underground Film Festival and free screenings To take advantage of those screenings sign up for their email every now and then they ll let you know if something cool and free is going on From foreign films to festivals to free Showtime previews this theater has it all 
-9b9vG2tOg8KCdaop5P6GQ Harvard Simply put the most delicious overflowing omlettes I ve had The eggs seem almost like a distraction next to the prodigious quantity of vegetables The home fries are great too An exceptional breakfast brunch That said the service is notoriously unpredictable I ve had some long waits both to sit and to order and the staff seems different every time hilariously I ve had some children who happened to be hanging around bring me my silverware But all is forgiven when the food comes Oh man I m hungry just thinking about it 
-9Ei4mop6kWAt4dNgVcCOA Harvard I finally had a chance to make it over to Mr Bartley s last night Completely on a whim my wife suggested we roll over to check it out since the last time we tried they were closed Anyway the overall experience was exactly what I had expected from a place that is well known for good burgers totally packed with customers ok service and small cramped tables However we were able to order while waiting for a table which was awesome Overall the burgers were very good You can taste the quality in the burger and without slathering any mustard or ketchup on my sandwich that stuff only masks the true flavor of the beef the overall flavor was delicious The meat reminded me of Louis Lunch in New Haven which is a good thing However the onion rings that came with my burg were just ok They were shoe string onion rings but drenched in a very flour y tasting batter Needless to say I ll be back to try the dozens of burgers on the menu Don t forget to bring cash 
-9Enpq8swK3J0Euq1exR5A Harvard I ve always been a Qdoba fan and this establishment seemed to serve up exactly as expected I ordered a shredded beef burrito and was very happy with the taste quality and overall experience consuming it There are three nice booths beyond the fountain bev area which are much quieter and more intimate than the large boisterous dining room 
-9JaAPUcIbgbrddC3zTMHA Harvard i ve only been here once but i freaking LOVE this place i went here a month ago because my friend saw it on phantom gourmet she got the tom brady and i got the ipod we didn t have to wait in line that long i suggest you look at the menu online before going because they have like 50 different burgers to choose from but you don t have to get a burger but i suggest it my burger had boursin cheese on it it was so good that i had to get me some from shaw s THANK YOU SHAW S FOR HAVING A SALE ON BOURSIN CHEESE YOU MUST GET THE SWEET POTATO FRIES best sweet potato fries i ve ever had hands down better than b good no offense b good i can t even describe the feeling into words when you bite into those orange fries delicious is an understatement why only 4 stars if i love this place NO REFILLS i m sorry but that really bothers me but i am glad you serve coke and NOT pepsi because i despise pepsi oh and they only take cash you better get some before you come 
-9lxMYj9g-AesIVC_RUq3A Harvard If you re happening to be in Harvard Square you definitely need to check out this place I always seem to order the same thing grilled chicken sandwich and I finally switched it up and order pork pulled it was good but i definitely love their grilled chicken better The price is definitely affordable 
-9mTsmbCVrJYQTBPqTYesg Harvard It s a weird building It kind of looks like a weird futuristic city built into the middle of MIT It s also a little weird to go through if you ve never been there before as there s so much going on and so many different entrances and exits I like it primarily because my primary gym is here the Alumni Center and I can easily work out midday without any wait for a machine There is a lot of construction going on outside of it so the parking s decreased and I don t know what they re building there maybe a building that looks like a futuristic park or something 
-9QorjguYxDcprwnqqkOOw Harvard I like this place because I eat a lot and I think it s fun putting them together for them to stirfry together for me BUT everything always ends up tasting kind of the same after awhile Fun nevertheless I think that s most of the appeal 
-9vPjGy9ws9f0OAEdnyQPg Harvard I m not a fast food fan but when I m in a real rush i e it s 1 18 PM and I m starving but I still haven t left home for my 1 30 PM meeting that s a 10 minute walk away nothing beats the Southern Style Chicken sandwich at McDonald s and this one happens to be a few blocks from my apartment and on my way to work Within 2 min and at a cost of a little over 3 I have something tasty to fill my growling tummy that I can easily eat while walking and of course it helps me avoid sitting through a 2 hour meeting on an empty stomach While it doesn t hold a candle to a Chick Fil A sandwich an establishment that I make a point to visit anytime I m in a city that has one it s the closest thing I ve come across Oh and their hot fudge sundaes are the best sundaes I ve had ever I d take one over a fancy version prepared by some high end restaurant any day 
-a0_qPc4uzjTtII_saE5MQ Harvard The ice cream is really good and homemade but Its so absurdly expensive but I guess I ll give out five stars sigh Anyway the service is usually really great and they ll let you try as many flavors as you want before you make your final selection I m a fan of the Cocoa Pudding although its ridiculously rich Tiramisu is also delicious Burnt Caramel Hydrox Cookie Gingersnap and Belgian Chocolate are all very good but its all about the Cocoa Pudding for the chocolate overload And they have free WiFi As every cafe should They also have this neat board which you can text message phrases to but sometimes I haven t had the best of luck getting it to work but that might be my phone service The seating space is pretty good although its usually rather busy I ve heard that their brunch is good I ll have to check it out soon 
-AaaPA8I1jE8-7M99pho2g Harvard Do burgers get better than this I really like all the different topping combinations they ve got and the burgers are almost always cooked correctly to order Add to that some of the best frappes in the Boston area and this place is a winner I would give them 5 stars but there are a couple things that I don t particularly care for cash only seriously onion rings they re too greasy and have no flavor the wait especially when it is cold no bathrooms 
-AEj465TszkhlulCbIAlfw Harvard the raspberry chocolate chip frozen yogurt was tart and awesome 
-aeMhY03z88dS1EmTLIBIQ Harvard Delicious I came here with a friend and neither of us could decide on what to get so we decided to split The Whole Nine Yards which is a sampler plate of nine of the restaurants top dessert items I honestly don t think I can pick a favorite of the nine items They each had their own unique character and some had interesting flavor combinations It s a bit pricey and it took a while for us to get our desserts but for the quality of desserts prepared on our plate it was well worth it It was art You can t rush art 
-Aka1qQw_89C9FZYOo3hWA Harvard I have been here several times and would definitely go back as the food is delicious and that can usually trump any other small issues that one may have with an eating establishment However the service is not amazing sometimes I felt like they forgot about my table Also I have been on a Sunday for their brunch and I had the eggs benedict which was great however don t go if you don t want your brunch interrupted by the sounds of some Harvard mens acapella group I know it s supposed to be fun and kitschy and all of that but I guess I m not old enough to appreciate or enjoy being sung to by a barbershop quartet while I m trying to enjoy my eggs It was just annoying 
-aKI6fKZyutLUOSLPYv-FQ Harvard Shaped like a double wide old train car diner and styled like the 1950s in outer space VG packs its punches in hip friendly waitstaff cool d cor and most of all blast off out of this world delicious space food that s light years away from Tang The diner specializes in vegetarian vegan versions of classic diner fare such as a facon B L T grilled seitan and greens and Vegetable Tofu pot pie In the end I couldn t decide on one entree so I ordered a smattering of sides including the soup special of the day Caramelized Onion Soup The soup ended up tasting rather eggplant y and the consistency was thicker than I d hoped It would have been better with cheese but still it was pretty tasty Most of the menu is vegan or has a vegan option available Hash was my next epicurean adventure The hash came with salty diced potatoes and spicy seitan It was my first time ever getting to try the diner standby I loaded it up with ketchup and sriracha from their cute little racha saucer and it was delicious My last dinner item was a black pepper biscuit yet another item that I was thrilled to see on the menu VG s pepper biscuits weren t exactly Southern style but smothered in butter or some butter like substance they were moist and damn delicious One qualm though with this and with the lemon merengue pie vegan merengue Yes How the eff did they do that the prices did seem a little overinflated to me 2 95 for a single biscuit 6 50 for a smallish piece of pie Knock these off by a dollar or half and a little more old school charming diner cred would be bestowed But everything was so good I can forgive the inter stellar aliens this Still 5 stars for ingenuity Full review on my blog Thoroughly Modern Milli Vanilli http bit ly nedozu 
-ALnACCoFiGfpEoBXcqLtA Harvard This place was always great for browsing but lousy for buying Aside from getting textbooks I think everyone just used it as a meeting place On the other hand it s your one stop shopping center for all of your Harvard paraphernalia needs 
-amQDs2YXYvQE7iNIU_iPA Harvard it is loud in here but it s a great atmosphere for a fun dinner with friends or a birthday dinner the chips and salsa are great to start the meal the queso dip and guacemole are also tasty my friends and i always split the fajitas once you re done eating here you will be majorly full it s a lot of fun to just go and have some margaritas and some laughs very friendly speedy service my favorite mexican place in the area 
-AnasHXEOhpP4_nX0jg9Pg Harvard The crowd here is old white and middle upper class So if that s your type go for it I ve had some tasty things here but it s too expensive and touristy for my tastes For good food go For great food that s unique go elsewhere 
-AQ-rKCsve9UbhUs3JAmfQ Harvard You will never taste anything like it And that s why I have to give it 5 stars My favorite is the white hot chocolate However if you don t like drinks and desserts that are PURE SUGAR try the milk or dark chocolate instead Forget that stuff made with powder and water Burdick s hot chocolate puts even most milk based hot chocolate to shame So rich you will feel like you should be eating it with a spoon The pastries I ve had here have been delish too especially the tiny cute macarons little airy puffs bound together by buttercream frosting Yum Interesting flavors like ginger and pistachio Seating here is limited so you may want to get your hot chocolate to go But if you re really keen to sit down and linger over your cup with a friend a table usually opens up if you just stand and wait it s a small space so it s hard for loiterers to escape the hairy eyeball As at least one other reviewer said I m not sure what the deal is with the miniature chocolate mice They are overpriced and why do you need your snack to be shaped like a mouse in the first place However I guarantee you that if you buy a 3 pack of these for most women they will think it is an ADORABLE gift Just don t try this with me please Come to think of it all of Burdick s chocolates are overpriced I was once with a friend who was visiting Boston and decided to pick out gifts at Burdick s for her friends back home When she saw the final total at the cash register she put everything back and canceled the purchase That about sums up my feelings about the chocolates But Burdick s is smart Tourists come here and they will shell out serious cash for very good chocolate especially when it is shaped like a mouse 
-aRI7_2_ynI09xNBmOFhMA Harvard If you re a guy who would like to add some flair to your wardrobe this is the place for you Unlike the shops in Providence you will never walk out of this place empty handed Great clothes real cheap even some designer stuff Let me tell you some of my most loved clothes were purchased here From ties to shorts The Garment District has it all for men who enjoy looking good 
-aroga1adii0-Hx2SrsUeA Harvard so this was my NYE destination for better or worse so the food was good but not worth 85 for a pre fixed meal and the portions were a bit skimpy as in my friend ordered the scallop and her plate had a single scallop on it but the lavendar martinis are so good granted prob not what i needed after consuming several bottles of champagne but tasty from what i remember our server was nice hell she put up with 5 kinda drunk girls i think i d go back on a regular night and try it again 
-AUAOw6sDb1xISt7eZt0MQ Harvard I m not a connoisseur of body shops who would admit to it but I was totally pleased with my interaction with De Leo s I had my sideview mirror broken off by some idiot vandal and delayed getting it fixed because I didn t want to deal with some garage ripping me off I eventually chose this place because it s next to the Tappet brothers garage and I thought maybe they would at least be funny like Click and Clack Anyway Denise in the office was great at handling my call and setting up the parts order When the parts came in I drove down and Leo immediately stopped what he was doing to install the new mirror while I waited He was friendly when I asked him to show me a few things he was doing What they charged was below the insurance company s appraisal I was totally happy with the experience and look forward to the next mishap so I can visit again 
-AzEmf85_sQB2LLrW0V57w Harvard In the never ending quest for good sushi in Cambridge we decided to give this place another whirl especially since it seems the highest rated option this side of the river according to my fellow yelpers We had been here before and the experience wasn t remarkable except that at the time they didn t serve beer or wine just sake Since it didn t stick out as bad in our memory it wsa time for a second chance sitting down to the menu of 60 70 custom maki rolls just was astonishing and spicy on every other one made my mouth water Maybe just maybe this will be the new place a ritual sushi retreat during summer evenings the shumai that came started things right and the 4 rolls chosen really sounded bang on then we realized that there can be a problem with rolls that all describe items that are on top and other items that are inside sometimes too much is too much spicy tuna and grilled scallops on top of a shrimp tempura roll it s just too much shit going on in every bite sushi is supposed to taste light fresh almost crisp this stuff came across as messy and just downright busy that would warrant about 3 stars But I have to ding the place one star because of the swarm of fruit flies at our table that s a little too much summer eating for my taste moving on 
-AZh3AHLL83pBSJyemoV3A Harvard Terrific customer service a HUGE selection of frames for every face type and awesome location See is the best I was looking around but not finding anything until I approached the woman working there I have a small face and she pointed me to the petite young adult kids area She gave me space to try on a lot of frames but must have been discreetly watching since she went into the back and came out with a few more frames she thought I might like She chose well and I ended up buying a cute pair from her selection She was really friendly and competent as was the guy working there when I went to pick up my glasses a week later They have funky modern fashionable and classic frames all under one roof Each style comes in a variety of colors so don t be shy I was afraid of messing up their display by trying on different glasses but the folks there WANT you to try out their frames I think they get an OCD kick out of rearranging them anyway Note The prices on the frames INCLUDES the lenses which is awesome You only have to pay extra for any coatings you get 
-b-NG-QmlZRMCK2DgHoc4g Harvard Maybe I m just easy to please but I like their cupcakes The Boston Cream is tasty And most recently I had Chocolate Cranberry which was quite interesting It had a delightful cranberry jam center I suppose the cake was a bit on the dry side but I had a nice cold carton of milk to wash it down with I do wish you could actually order a tall cold glass of milk instead of just getting a carton out of the beverage fridge Also it seems like a lot of people complain about the dryness so perhaps they should experiment with some new recipes Another neat thing is that we went on the day of the Mad Men Season III Finale so they were playing episodes on the TV and they had Mad Men themed cupcakes I guess the owner is a huge Mad Men fan Very cool The main reason why I m not giving them 4 stars is that I just don t think the cupcakes are worth 3 25 They re rather diminutive and I think they need to be a little larger to justify the cost they don t have to be massive mind you maybe just the next cup size up Still they do make a nice treat every once in awhile And the level of service cupcake packaging and ambiance are exemplary 
-B8W-2FQQFdcd9A3DfJsxA Harvard It s a default go to for me Consistent and a crowd pleaser Relaxed easy no fuss but delicious Simple yet creative I like to start with the arugula salad and I highly recommend the rosemary potato pizza Plenty of beers or wines to choose from but nothing overwhelming Service has always been up to par and location is ideal 
-bAyURpIqAdPK-Dj9gyQ6w Harvard IHOP doesn t really come that high in my book I mainly remember it as that place that my dad liked to take us for Sunday brunch only to find out that everyone else s dad was just as lazy Nowadays if I eat breakfast most of the time I get up too late for it to happen I mostly cook for myself but there are just some times when that isn t an option Finding your sleep schedule completely night shifted and waking up just after midnight in the middle of January is one of these times Fortunately this IHOP by virtue of being open late enough for my friends to form a food mob at midnight gains my sympathy It s a haven in a storm where by haven I mean a place that serves halfway decent food that at this time of night isn t absolutely sketchtastic Let s be honest here IHOP is a chain restaurant The menu is the same over the whole country I can go ahead and say that this particular incarnation of IHOP isn t as bad as they come The food is decently cooked at indecent hours of the night and though there are better deals out there the prices won t kill you To its credit this IHOP is spanking clean probably because it s one of the newer establishments in the area As with any chain restaurant of this type you get what you pay for it s a cheap eat and the service is correspondingly unresponsive You probably don t want to deviate too far from the set menu In the end IHOP is at best a run of the mill place While it s the best option for a late night food mob if you go by there during the day my personal recommendation is pay 5 extra for your meal and head to Takemura which happens to be right underneath and far more worth the trouble of eating out 
-BaziKbN5XU9IgTMDnzSpg Harvard Just so people don t go looking for it this place has been gone for at least a year now it was in the spot that Saladworks currently occupies 
-bbSG6bCYG7agQDhcfRSiw Harvard Is this to review Cambridge I like it its cute I would live in it if I could and if i had a driveway The only thing i ve noticed are a lot of its residents are the same Mostly the gray long haired ladies with their 1991 blossom hats and denim dresses shopping at whole foods who are just offended in general Other than that cute cute cute A lot of the area is convenient to a T line somewhere There is also a ton to do and eat in cambridge One of my fav places which is no longer Manray was located here I love that some of the best middle eastern food is here and especially schoenhofs with its foreign books and hudson news with its foreign mags I miss it I must come visit but I hate to go alone 
-bBZEtkcp3qL9snD1ul9Lw Harvard You know what I have great fucking eyebrows They are legendary around these parts I owe it all to Kristin I came to Pyara a few months back after an unfortunate 8 wax from a place that shall not be named After the guy waxed my brows he was basically like oh hay gurl I changed the shape of your brows btw which resulted in very thin eyebrows and no arch Not a good look for me I saw Kristin a few weeks later and with her help she got my brows back to not looking completely hideous 
-Bcxvkg2dhfnQ5BPraZeRw Harvard A bit of a cave but great people great food great value Classic spot 
-BF4nyT3pNGOOUVTkK0Kpw Harvard Charming decor wonderful cocktails delicious fancy food with comforting Southern influences Hungry Mother is our new favorite restaurant in Boston We came without a reservation and got seated in the bar area immediately We started with the creamy spicy pimiento cheese and the decadent fried oysters The fat juicy oysters perfectly balanced by crisp batter arrived at our table hot from the pan accompanied by a refreshing kohlslaw which I took to be coleslaw made from kohlrabi It was the best part of our meal The tender fried catfish with andouille and hoppin john I love saying hoppin john put up tough competition though After a minor scuffle over who got to order the catfish my gracious boyfriend settled on the chicken perfectly cooked with crispy skin wonderful veggies and scrumptious pan juices Portions are not large here and we ended the night with coffee and the lemon chess pie with caramel and buttermilk ice cream Very sweet yet still delicious 
-bflVORq8NKbwKLk0gpStA Harvard Mary Chung seems to be a solid choice for Chinese food when you re out and about in Central It s nothing extraordinarily stellar to write home about but it s reasonably priced centrally located and extremely edible I came here with some friends around 6 on a Friday night before heading to MIT to see a play and we were able to be seated right away The service was decent again nothing stellar but nothing to really complain about We had the Hot Platter for an appetizer which is really just an assortment of friend things It was nice to nosh on but I ll admit I m not enamored of fried foo as a rule I had the Moo Shi Vegetable which was definitely served with ample plum sauce and plenty of pancakes And while it was tasty I did find myself wishing I d ordered it with some meat In the past I d had their General Gau s chicken and it s definitely yummy So maybe I ll go back to that next time Word of warning Their spicy noodles I think it s the dun dun noodles are veeeeeeeery spicy So be prepared Oh and they re cash only which is good to know before walking in Overall if I lived closer I d definitely order from them more often and if I m in the area I may choose this place but for now it s gonna stick on the list of places that are possibilities and will not likely be making a pilgrimage to Central just for this place 
-BiUUCcXRX_Ktp2kdlm2xA Harvard This has always been one of our favorites in the Boston area Not the usual style dim sum that most folks are accustomed to but a more savory Northern Chinese style cuisine Eating here has always left us satisfied 
-bjdCwpumWJIE9BsqAdGzw Harvard This place is absolutely amazing I am your stereotypical hippie chick a few imported grooming products here a few natural pumices here in the grooming department But I have a weakness for the scent of violets and it s in every perfume I ever wear Due to the nature of violets you cannot smell them a few seconds after you put them on they come in wafts and breezes When browsing this shop one day a standard hmm do they have anything pretty today on my way from Bob Slate to Burdick s I found violetta soap Given that I took French instead of Italian I thought perhaps violetta was their word for pansy pens e No It s actual violet soap that keeps its scent and was worth the 8 I paid for it and the bar is of a size to last me a year of daily showers 
-bJH5Zrx7rU0_Y6Ud_Y4Yg Harvard Hands down worst range barbershop around Boston If it were at a Supercuts price then sure why not four stars But it isn t I went to the barber to the far left next to the window He was staring out of the window half the time when he was cutting my hair resulting in a cut way too short and uneven Maybe he was just out of it that day but in that case he should have just not come into work Worst the female stylist in the middle was terribly annoying All she did was gab and ask her customers intrusive questions Talk about an awkward social setting The only real plus is the location which is right off of the T and near the MIT campus 
-BKbLY-4q92XoKUf3gkoWw Harvard Good for a fancy date A bit expensive but very good 
-bL5h_AzlT9gzYVSdNhaEQ Harvard I ve been back many times since I first posted a review most recently last week the food has been consistently excellent It would be hard to improve upon the skillful attention given to both the food and the service and I enjoy spending time in the bar area or in either of the warmly cozy dining rooms I just wish they had more seating because the place fills up fast I think you can t go wrong trying anything on their menu I m going to sing the praises of their house drinks one in particular 43 made from rye port bitters and maple syrup has a smooth subtle complexity that I can still recall a week later A darkly sophisticated unmistakably grown up drink that also happens to be quite delish Edit more love They will do take out although that s not the focus of their business I can get the boiled peanuts to go and they are sooooo yummy Yay 
-BLJ4y1BCSgWC7Ub9i_P8A Harvard If you just go for the cocktails and the bar food you ll be fine For dinner go across the street to Salts or to Craigie or to Rendezvous But definitely have fun at the bar at Cuchi Cuchi 
-bluwNZ3BwPjthfrP_00HQ Harvard I love Miracle of Science on nights when the music is really great like tonight and Annie is working The food is very yummy the Coke was ice cold and the margarita did the trick I ve only been here twice and see it only as 5 star worthy The cherry on top the menu Periodic table Very select But well worth it 
-Bp4Vl1Rkyaorp1pHtKN2g Harvard I saw Matthew Good on Saturday at Middle East Such a great show I ve been to my fair share of venues and this space is amazing Great sound small and intimate a bar on each side and even places to sit And clean bathrooms The restaurant is absolutely great too I could sit there and hang out for hours Such a great vibe My boyfriend and I both vegan had dozens to choose from Which is very rare most of the time They also clearly mark what is vegan and what is not The menu is mostly of the Middle Eastern cuisine duhh but they have some sandwiches and a veggie burger and fries if that s not your thing The food was really reasonable and pretty good I got the vegetable coucous a little bland but hey it s coucous The hummus and tabloule were soo good 4 50 blue moons what These New Yorkers were in heaven Our server Sonia was really great Very attentive and she kept the table stocked with complimentary pita bread and hey it is free pita bread stop complaining people And we even annoyingly split the check with 4 credit cards and she didn t mind at all I would absolutely come back here for drinking eating hanging out seeing a show This place is kinda perfect 
-bpGnoc4c7R2nvCoGYe1Rw Harvard Henrietta s table is an elegant place to eat well prepared food The menu has a New England slant The food is uniformly hearty and fresh made with wonderful ingredients Even the bread is terrific Prices are a little high Service is very good Parking is awful be prepared to use the hotel lot or take the T 
-bPIneXmxPkK2iO_4feyfQ Harvard I still can t figure out why this place is called Thailand Cafe when it has such great Chinese food Whenever my friends visit me in Cambridge I take them here to give them a taste of real spicy Sichuan food They don t have a very big selection the only downside to me but of the ones they have all of them are very well prepared Service can be a little slow but the ladies are very helpful Once I had a dish that was too salty and they offered me a free new dish 
-bQImkD3rBoNGWGzrtDHCQ Harvard I went to Daedalus on the evening before the annual Harvard Yale football game so I probably had an atypical Daedalus experience First it was packed but with awkwardly old people By that I mean guys whose pale pattern baldness give further evidence that they might be too old to be drunkenly yelling at the bartender and calling each other bro But that aside Daedalus was relatively pleasant Since it was too packed to sit inside we opted to go out onto the roofdeck even though it was practically freezing I was really happy to discover that they had a bunch of these large heating lamps so we were much toastier than expected They also had a good selection of hard cider I recommend getting a bottle of Original Sin 
-Brmdgq1HSBCeWPd_8Lchw Harvard I m proud of myself for cleaning out my closet and consigning some of the nicer items It takes a while to get your but you can check your account s progress online which is really exciting They took 11 items of mine and so far 2mos later 8 have sold which I think is pretty good You can only get your check once a quarter so likely you will have to get 2 checks for your haul but it s still a nice surprise Also bonus this location has two floors and they have pretty good taste selecting cool items Clearance items can get you a great deal Just keep in mind this isn t Goodwill A designer jacket on consignment may still be 50 but it s a much better deal than the original price 
-bt0p_hlzZ_fI9juXmjgOA Harvard This is an excellent venue if you want to go either learn practice the basics of Salsa Merengue Bachata or are looking for a relaxed place with fun people to dance the night away to your favorite latin beats Or perhaps you love to show up your moves and make us all jealous The Dj s are Amazing D J Martinez and D J Saoko to name a couple spin some wicked tunes the dance floor is in excellent shape and polished often there are two full bars and the kitchen is open late if you get hungry The crowd is manageable and you will have plenty of roon in the dance floor to do your shines There are ocassional performances by guests that happen at midnight The levels of the dancers are varied anything from begginers to very advanced but I have noticed that the people that come here are very welcoming and make you feel at home This is deffinitly a spot worth checking out and I am sure that once you come you will return again and again There is a free lesson from 9 30 to about 10 30 and then social dancing until 2 AM I can t help you about the last bus being at 1 AM though you are on your own for that 
-bUZppH9XZP4kWpg2LMjTQ Harvard I ve been twice and never ate fresher or tastier food 1st time a la carte second time a pescetarian tasting menu amazing Farm to Table What more can I say I mean octopus that was as tender as a white fish or salmon and I thought I didn t like octopus I could talk all day 
-BWIwhot3GHmp8170Dhoxw Harvard I received a very nice note from one of the owners after posting my review Knowing that the proprietors care about their customers experience and opinions enough to 1 keep track and 2 try to make amends for a bad experience is heartwarming I m much more likely to give BerryLine another try now 
-bWRRrcSg1m4wN5YVuvgug Harvard I ve eaten inside and out upstairs technically that s the Enormous Room but it s all the same team and down and CK is a good place to have close to home They just made the outside option a reality like 2 weeks ago and when the weather isn t too hot it turns out to be a great place to sit and drink and eat Every dish you get here will be heavily salted including passed apps for functions at Enormous but I love salt perhaps cause it makes me want to drink and I love to drink I do need to throw a small demerit for chronically inadequate salad options That it is next to Rainbow Alley aka Candyland Smack Pass TagLab is a big plus for those of us who are artsy by inclination Really good graffiti and a good place to hang for a smoke Also you d expect the Alley to smell a lot more like urine than it does Not sure how much CK contributes to keeping unsavory aromas of that sort in check but it lends a much greater sense of hygienic cred when a place can so tastefully dispense food in such immediate geographic proximity to what should naturally be hotspot of fermenting urban stink CK as woman classy and dignified in frequently unpleasant surroundings Makes your mouth water for more when you get a taste Knows some good tricks plus she ll gladly send you upstairs to hang with her sister if you re into that sort of deal She s seasoned rather than young and fresh but she s still got her figure and knows how to use it Plus she s recently developed a taste for action outdoors when weather permits so she continues to be open to new experiences 
-bwx9-WR2nQBBzdRHEzmSg Harvard Went there with family on st patricks day Real good meal and the beer was great 
-bXCoiZZ0OaZ5LzClpWsGw Harvard I have loved Rendezvous since it opened and come here all the time I ve never had a bad meal the cocktails are delicious the ambience fantastic and the owners seem like super nice people who really enjoy food However One star had to be deducted for the male bartender I believe his name is Brian While I have never experienced anything but impecable friendly attentive service from everyone else at this restaurant he has always been rude inattentive and poorly performed his job The first time this happened I thought maybe it s an off night we all have them The second time I also let it slide However it happens everytime I ve sat at his bar As I have bartended myself my standards are pretty lax keep my beverage filled ask me if the food is okay and say thank you when you drop the check and you re guaranteed over 20 I understand if you re busy but don t chat with the person next to me for 20 minutes and ignore the fact that yes I would love a second glass of wine There really aren t any excuses for service this bad particularly when one is dropping over 100 on a meal It s enough to make me not go back but I ll probably just find nights he s not working and frequent Rendezvous then 
-BZSBtvJ2UMi99TKCkmylQ Harvard Food was good you get to make it yourself The first time I went to this place I really liked it because of the novelty However once I went to this place another time for a creative night out it really didn t get me going Despite all of he choices they all seem to be limited to either an asian or a north american style of eating I wound up being unimpressed the second time Also the service could be better and the menu could be more accurately priced it s structured somewhat oddly 
-BZuj6ugqJhnfWXcDPGiVQ Harvard after TWO WEEKS of calling leaving messages etc i was finally refunded the overcharge not one call was returned not one NOT OK even if it were a 10 overcharge and this was a 72 overcharge 3 times the bill amount totally unacceptable 
-c2yO-V_t6Ro6oKFvCzYeQ Harvard Ok I very rarely write a negative review but since this establishment has gotten so many great ones I might as well do the buyer or eater beware Or at least be one of those I have only eaten here once and you will know why and the food here was pretty good I have had better from other diners before namely in chicago but it is a pretty decent place if you are around the neighborhood and you can t think of anywhere else to go and you are in the mood for diner food Now the bad part I came here on a pretty dead day and wandered in having read all the great reviews on facebook People seem to have a thing for the Simpson s decor and loved to mention it When I first walked in I honestly looked around and raised a brow honestly surprised Ok Its not exactly decorated fully in Simpson gear it has a few things here and there but when I think of a place filled to the brim with Simpson memorabilia I think of it as toys crawling in every nook and cranny in the most obscene manner So if you are a newcomer and are used to old school diner with a certain theme obsession take the Simpson decor comments with a grain of salt There is not that much That honestly isn t what knocked down the stars hough and I forgive the establishment for the lack thereof i m not a big fan of the Simpson s anyway The biggest hit and the reason why I have given only two stars is a the food was pretty good but When closing the door of the shop since it was getting a bit chilly a layer of black dust settled across my food and my coffee At first I thought it was black pepper that somehow got blown all over I like to give people the benefit of the doubt but when I saw exactly where it was and it was EVERYWHERE not just on my immediate spot but on the register and etc I immediately felt sick to my stomach I ve eaten at pretty greasy diners and this one definitely takes the cake But not in a good way So sorry Sunny Greasy dirty diners are cool in my book But not when they are so dirty that a layer of dirt settles over my food and coffee when a slight breeze flutters in 
-C3MyZBUSR75wKE8RIkGAQ Harvard Oh the yuckiness of this place where to begin Since it s a shabu shabu joint let s start with the broth Our large ish group ordered 3 different broths all of which looked suspiciously the same like cloudy dishwater The overwhelming flavor of each was salt I think they dissolved some bouillon cubes in some hot water and served them as miso regular and a third variety that I m blanking on at the moment perhaps because the memorable flavor was salt That ought to be enough to put you off this place But in case you still think Shabu Square might have some redeeming qualities that could merit checking it out in person please allow me to further disabuse you of that sadly mistaken idea Their spring rolls were hard and tasteless again all I remember is saltiness Their lighting is harsh they don t serve alcohol and their waitstaff while friendly has such a poor grasp of English that ordering will be a tortured process of repetitions menu pointing and wondering if you ll get what you actually tried to order In short Do Not Go Instead go to Shabu Ya around the corner A world of difference 
-c9ToJ6MKmEUZ_PX1m46aA Harvard I don t know why this place has such high reviews Such a high distribution of 4 and 5 stars for something that wasn t that great I came here for a quick lunch and ordered the Hot Chick with a 2 combo onion rings and a soda Amused by the puns calling their chicken sandwiches chicks but that aside this sandwich could have been a lot better What I got was a pretty flat chicken sandwich which a smooched chicken filet in the middle amidst all the blue cheese I had asked for the crispy chicken but when I got it it was pretty soggy I guess the hot part of hot chick was meant to be spicy but it was pretty mild in my opinion The onion rings were pretty interesting They had a smooth crunchy batter rather than the grainy crunchy batter most places have They were pretty good and the rings were quite large A nice side to a not so nice burger This place was eh and if I find myself in the area will definitely look for another burger joint 
-cBciG6C2FCrWTSXY3fKTg Harvard I went here a couple of times in the week that it opened it was pleasant calm peaceful with free and easy WiFi with good mellow music in the background and all around a nice place to study read or have coffee lunch with someone Now it s incredibly overcrowded loud not just people the music is SO LOID chaotic with WiFi that only works half the time and all around headache inducing atmosphere True Crema Cafe has a great decor and nice intimate feel but it s always at max capacity making it difficult to get around means withing in 3 4 person long lines for the bathroom means waiting 10 15 minutes for a basic and still not have a place to sit They do make good sandwiches though but I d only stop in if you have an extra 15 minutes to spare and take it to eat elsewhere It s a great concept and I love the design of the place However it s incredibly popular I d recommend only coming at off peak hours just after opening or before closing 
-CBXg1kGREhTdJ_kItkiyg Harvard This place is nothing to rave about but you can t beat there happy hour prices 1 2 all food 4 7 p m everyday Loved the cheese fondue for two but it is really meant for about six people 
-cDK3b2VQN_w5u4zILr5Nw Harvard This is kind of a standard cocktail lounge in Harvard Square But it s a place you end up going multiple times because there aren t many options like it in the Square but also because they do everything decently well I came here for a party We were all seated in the back in a semi private room which was great There were long tables and chairs against the walls and plenty of seating room To be honest it was a great set up for this party I can t speak to the price since I didn t pay but the drinks were pretty decent and standard and the food fare was about the same As one of the few options it does the trick 
-CF19B0_N_a2DNQixj0Zog Harvard Love the soul night Eclectic mix of people eccentrically dressed and unpresumptuous People come to get down I feel unity on soul nights Also love the queerish whatever goes nights Fruitcake is the bomb Where has it been The other Tuesday nights are just as Rad Just last week one of the front door bouncer do it all ladies helped my friends out Some semi drunk dude came dancing up behind one of my friends She was sort of unaware However i was not because she is my ex and I am protective Super Bouncer lets call her interjected in a casual way and pulled him aside to check his ID I later on thanked her She then later on stopped by and whispered that he was probably on his way out as he was increasingly annoying other around him and was a bit too drunk She said to just let her know if he was a problem and he would get the boot It was very nice of her I ve been ah missing manray ever since it closed years back This place brings back a little of the fun I used to have there Plus duuuurty Central which is cleaning up btw is just so fun and random p to the s the decor is chill and relaxing While waiting for my friends to arrive I picked up a Pheonix and a draaank and cozied up on the couch under red lights that make you feel warm and want to stick your tongue out at passersby outside cause your all cozy and there all not in the winter atleast PaDoW 
-CHazLwo2j2G8gWEZN53hA Harvard I really like this venue While it may be small it s cozy there are places to talk play pool and Terri in the back makes the best damned drinks When I go to either Heroes or XMortis it is devoid of the college crowd which is always nice It s a great little space easily reachable by the T and it s easy to catch a cab home as well 
-CiNx1QwNluOzhCjqkUI1w Harvard Cuchi Cuchi is the perfect restaurant for special occasions or drinks with the girls Their cocktail list is so extensive that it makes it impossible to choose I ve sampled about half of their menu and I can honestly say that there hasn t been a single drink that I haven t enjoyed The food is to die for The stuffed artichoke is my absolute fav It can get a little pricey for 2 people probably 2 4 plates is necessary So on The ambiance well it s just perfect You have to go and least see it once words do not do it justice I secretly want to work there just so I can dress up like the waitresses Whenever I go with four or more people probably 10 tops I request the LED table It s super fun and everyone winds up loving it 
-cJFzx-n3ND9z9ClsvM-zA Harvard I have been here twice since watching it s long renovation on Prospect Street every morning since they announced the move from Inman Sq The first time I walked through the door I went though a short interview and went right up onto the main stage Because the Red Cross was holding a blood drive there and the beds were set up on the stage The interview process happened in the smalles studio to the right side of the building It is a nice place it looks a bit makeshift and the bathrooms are plentiful The next time I went was for the Sunday night Stand Up to see my friend Lamont Price headliner preform I wish they held the stand up on almost any other night of the week 9p on Sunday seems too late to believe Thursday night wouldve been waaaay easier for me to handle Friday or Saturday too Meh It was well worth it The small group of us grabbed a few pints at The Field before the show and then walked in just as the show was about to begin Unfortunately the beer is aaaaalllll the way at the front desk the bathrooms are also towards the front door The space is so small that you feel like you d be intterupting all focus to the stage if you move during the show The line up was good I had several laughs I really like stand up where improv doesn t really grab me this might be the only show I ll be into enough to return to here Welcome to Central ImprovBoston You done good kid You done good

-cMVpVxdNYHK1PDOI1cLOA Harvard This is my favorite sushi restaurant so far and I eat here way too often for my budget The sushi is fresh and delicious and there are some really unique combos though so far I ve only tried the uni avo roll and the philadelphia rolls and one with grilled salmon all so good that I doubt I ll ever get to try the rest of the menu There are good veggie options too The service is friendly and professional the decor is attractive and the music is great Also you can have your choice of sitting Japanese style or American style 
-CnlR2h_4idIGA8214zt5A Harvard Wow what a perfect place right in the heart of harvard square This is a nice classy place with an excellent drink selection and awesome food I had a burger that was juicy and perfect The people I was with were raving about how good their pizza chicken and perogis were This is a nice clean and classy place to grab dinner and get some drinks They have a late night menu too making this the perfect harvard square destination 
-CnQk4uQFKLMJGWZK6mQ3g Harvard Ok so for the good news they have fabulous bread of all kinds creative pastries quality ingredients VERY good coffee and breakfast pizza Also I like the aesthetic though the tables are sometimes so close together that you have to slide your ass along someone else s table to get in For the bad news the 3 times I have gone in the guy behind the counter has been so incredibly annoying that I nearly had to leave As far as I could tell this was a cafe not a karaoke bar so why were we forced to listen to him sing I don t understand just take people s orders no need to preform or editorialize 
-cnujBK1eX8MhpezK3vnlQ Harvard Always fun and always a good meal despite the wait and parking issues Don t wear your favorite jacket though because it will smell like Mexican food for a long time after And go easy on the free chips they are addictive and filling 
-CO-LgRKDYFegvYRmsAWnw Harvard This is my pizza of choice in Harvard Square 1 They must give you a quarter of the pie for the slice 2 There are yummy slice of the day specials 3 They serve beer 4 Free lemon water 5 Consistent service with a smile I wish they would stay open later Thursday through Saturday because that s prime post drinking meal time Stumbling here for a night cap and thin crust slice would be the perfect end to a Harvard Square rendezvous Finally today I forgot my credit cards and cash at home I only had my Crimson Cash ID card which they don t accept However they went beyond the call of duty as a pizzeria when they comp ed me a slice I will return to pay for my barbeque chicken slice yummm and again to savor all the other special slices Thanks Upper Crust 
-COI6q9jiy0e9eik1KLh_Q Harvard I know everyone is raving about the food at this place but I ve only ever experienced the late night bar section of Hungry Mother so this ll be a bar only review Get yourself over to the bar at Hungry Mother It s not as large a bar as Green Street or Craigie but the sheer inventiveness of Heather is astounding When she s not on one of her classic kicks she ll whip up something never before seen in this world just for you based on the vaguest of impressions I like bitter produced a whiskey based cocktail topped off with Stone Ruination Both her and the other bartender I ve had there have also been very solid on the classics on and off menu I really dig their huuuuuge ice cubes great for slowly melting barely diluting your drink while you sip Bar only review I know but I ve tried a number of their bar food items Every last one had an excellent mix of southern and fantastic Fried okra amazing better than fried pickles The cornbread was heavenly only beaten by Trina s in my book The boiled peanuts with sea salt were an excellent take on traditional bar food and not too expensive either It s all made me desperate to make some time to reserve a spot for a real meal there It s all so good Oh and they ll get you discount Kendall Cinema tix if you go early enough in the evening 
-CpCmM1rqxGrO8DjRld1zA Harvard Not as cheap or as good as I was hoping it would be from the look of it You know those places that look like total hidden gems This had that air being in the back of a little Indian grocery but didn t really meet my expectations It was about 8 50 for a masala dosa I think they are about 6 at Punjabi Dhaba where they are also better The dosa itself was entirely average It was enjoyable enough but not at all memorable and the filling didn t have a whole lot of flavor I m far from a masala dosa expert but of the few I ve had this wasn t the best 
-cpDKufhUGocdSekIdpmLg Harvard I ve been here a lot for leisurely meetings and get togethers Cafe Algiers is a Harvard Square standout for me simply because it s never been too crowded and service is never rushed Which can work both ways you might wait a while for you server but you ll never be pushed out the door either You re free to linger for hours on a pot of delicious mint tea and they ll top off your pot with more hot water if you d like too In addition to the mint tea I recommend the merguez spicy lamb sausage It s made in house and is damn tasty 
-cPJaT_kUJtjXGp9tfDoQg Harvard At first this place reminded me of Kara s Cupcakes in San Fran because of the pink decor but Sweet only had 3 flavors the day I went Vanilla Lemon Chocolate The only one worth trying is the chocolate cupcake because you can taste the chocolate in this cake and even bits of unmelted chips I wish the frosting wasn t so sugary and grainy It s also the same height as the cake too much The vanilla and lemon cupcakes were just alright I do want to try their version of carrot cake I ll be back 
-CQDwZ2Bu3l78VCvaFzpaQ Harvard Every time I head in to CBC I like it better and better Fine It s growing on me Great for happy hour Great for weekend lunch on the patio Not so great for tasty food across the board Go for the daily specials to try something unique Popular for beer towers And they have those big growler jugs for 10 a two buck deposit Not bad Typically known as CBC Overall go for the beer tower in the strongest ale they offer In the spring I like their Belgian beer Damn what s it called However taste it before ordering Some Belgians of theirs aren t so great ATMOSPHERE Down home lodge like or something You sort of feel like you re at a brewery Interesting right Well it s got a wooden bar and stools and tables and things Nothing fancy Good for big groups Smells of toasted barley and fermenting yeast BEER Inconsistent I love beer and microbrews especially There are a few beers that I think are great Their standard brews are great but their special brews have their ups and downs i e Belgian style beers don t taste anything like some of the Belgian beers you might get at say Bukoswki s in Inman I can t even give CBC credit for trying Their ambers and lagers and those dark ones are tasty Also I have been a big fan of the Barley wine Why can t you get THAT in a tall beer tower Good choices 1 Red God spring summer super strong hop flavor but it s surprisingly smooth and 8 5 abv 2 Amber Ale all the time is dark but smooth light on the hops enjoyed by many 3 Tall Tale Pale Ale all the time is pale but flavorful FOOD I like the pork chop That s about it I ve tried other dishes the fish and chips is dry the asian spring rolls are sort of tasteless and totally pre made They seem to have a lot of specials so I recommend giving those a shot In a nutshell their menu is constantly changing as of late and I love that 
-CRG9qVGwLorvgEs6hutXg Harvard I was shown a Beacon Hill apartment recently by one of the property managers for Mt Vernon While the spaces themselves seemed reasonably maintained the apartment itself was not as advertised did not match the pictures from the internet posting I don t appreciate having my time wasted

-CWepnrxh-bhXt6zjv6XFg Harvard I d been wanting to try Upstairs on the Square for a while and used Restaurant Week as the opportunity to do so I seriously wish I hadn t though I think that the only good part about the dinner there was the fun decor The service was just as bad as many of the reviews claim and I ended up eating more of the cold flavorless bread in the bread basket than I wanted to due to the fact that I was starving and none of the food was coming out I ordered the asparagus appetizer sole and lemon cheesecake off of the restaurant week menu and my companion ordered the tagliatelle with bolognese The asparagus appetizer consisted of a maple sugar custard with a few large spears of asparagus and a bit of mesclun The custard was a bit lumpy instead of being creamy and smooth and the asparagus was bland and waterlogged My entree was by far the worst part of the night though The lemon olive oil poached sole with artichoke chips and artichoke a oli that had sounded so delicious on the menu was near inedible The fish had been so overcooked that the consistency was more like mashed potatoes Not exactly appetizing The a oli had separated so there was an oily puddle on the plate and the greens that came with the dish were so soggy and flavorless that I took one mouthful and couldn t eat any more The only semi decent part of this dish was the one lonely artichoke chip that came on the plate it had a nice lemony flavor The tagliatelle with bolognese was the only decent food of the night and I ended up splitting most of that since I couldn t bring myself to eat the fishy mashed potatoes The Meyer lemon cheesecake with roasted pineapples was another disaster The crust was beyond soggy and the combination of the lemon and pineapple made for a seriously odd taste I tried just the cheesy part of the cheesecake without any of the pineapple or the crust and that wasn t half bad but the whole combination was not pleasant I might come back someday to try the tea service in the afternoon hopefully the service is better then but there is no way I would come back for a meal I still can t stop thinking about those fishy mashed potatoes so disgusting 
-CwwNYVTNYYGV85tRv6vHQ Harvard I don t recommend Lauren Dickerman as an optometrist First of all she starts you with a college intern who does a bunch of the initial tests like what is the smallest line you can read Second of all in my experience she has been extremely unprofessional I showed up for my second appointment on time and she had her coat on She looked at me surprised then decided to dilate my eyes while she went to go get lunch in Harvard Square While I was waiting in the lobby b c there is no where else to wait she got back from lunch and then started seeing another patient She forgot I was there Then when she remembered she just said I hope you had a nice snooze out there 
-cyeo7x6uwRsYsr08X7ECQ Harvard Area Four is the best thing that happened to Kendall Square this year I really like both the bakery and the restaurant Bakery has great selection of coffee cake whoopie pies mocha and red velvet brownies etc The coffee is pretty good and so is the atmosphere I have dined here quite a few times and the mushroom pizza is the best Other things I have really enjoyed are the macaroni cheese baba ganoush when it was on the menu muhammara a cauliflower small plate and the olive oil chocolate cake Every single one of those things were great I hope they continue to one of the best in Cambridge 
-D3Vy7mkOZWgX3RhOrqncw Harvard I started off with a lovely red wine Valle Reale from the Abruzzo region It was the evening s special wine To start I got the seared scallops which were perfectly caramelized and served with a small selection of interesting and unusual greens The waiter helped us identify the marsh samphire and was generally very helpful My main was the duck three ways the confit and breast were excellent but I found the spices to be a bit over powering in the sausage Our table ordered three desserts the lemon buttermilk pudding with huckleberry sauce polenta olive oil cake with honey lavender ice cream and spiced cherries and the vanilla bean panna cotta with mixed summer berries and pistacchio biscotti There was no unanimous favorite The panna cotta was rich and creamy and the fresh berries were an excellent complement The polenta cake was a surprising success The cake itself was a bit crunchy and added an interesting texture to the subtle palette The lemon buttermilk pudding was my least favorite personally although I loved the huckleberry sauce The Italian muscat wine was a lovely companion the waiter helped us identify where to get it either the Wine Cheese Cask in Somerville or Blanchards in Allston The atmosphere was very casual but the decor was still trendy and refined The waitstaff was friendly and helpful we asked numerous questions about the dishes and our waiter sought out any answer he didn t know himself 
-D4xBBbx_yggJDfvBJQFPQ Harvard I ve belonged to this gym for nearly three years and for the past seven months it has been a regular part of my mornings I ve been able to compile quite a bit of data and free 100 calorie Oreo snack pack samples over that time so I ll review in bullet points The Good The place is as clean as any high traffic gym can be You ll always see someone on staff mopping sweeping or scrubbing in the bathrooms If you re there at closing you ll see someone power washing the showers at least a couple times a week It has all of the machines free weights benches and cardio machines to get in a thorough workout While the space isn t enormous it is utilized as efficiently as it can be The machines are laid out in a very logical order so you re generally not going to be wandering around trying to find the pec fly machine The location is fantastic It is right in the middle of Central Square 100 feet from the T station with a Walgreen s on its left and a Gap clothing store on its right The sheer convenience of this BSC location is one of it s greatest assets The rush hours aren t too bad I ve found that gyms are busiest immediately after work during weekdays yet I ve never in three years had difficulty getting a workout in during that time of day In the morning and on the weekends the place is downright quiet The clientele is pleasant Gyms have a culture Some have the muscle headed regulars that bully folks off machines Others are so disorganized or undersized that folks scramble around for weights before someone else can take them The mix of good regulars and a generally relaxed non cutthroat atmosphere gives it a very good culture You can go to any other BSC on the weekends I ve been slowly taking a tour of other BSCs in the area Davis Square Weymouth Watertown etc The standard membership comes with the ability to visit other gyms during off peak hours and I ve taken full use of it The Bad You can find a cheaper gym The BSC s locations are fantastically convenient but such spaces cost money That cost is passed on to you For what you pay you get a lot but you do have to pay My membership is around 70 a month It is underground While I have no problem with this some folks love staring out the window while they work out If that s the case this is not your gym It is more like a bunker than an Italian villa There s no pool There s a steam room but there s no pool So if you re in it to swim you ll be disappointed Overall I recommend the BSC in Central and the BSCs as a whole to people interested in joining a gym I ve had nothing but good experiences and I think I ll be there for years to come 
-d7PgJbhSWmivdAFZfPD1A Harvard I feel like if you make anything in cupcake sizes I d be up for it God I m such a sucker for cuteness Interesting variety of flavors Of course the Red Velvet had to be got obvious choice at any cake shop OH Just remembered that we scored the last one right before these other two who said out loud that they wanted red velvet HEHE I am a sucker but I don t get suckered The cake itself was on the dry side though maybe because it was almost closing time At first glance it was a really cute shop But then I think the decorator had an identity crisis On the one hand it was a cozy and homey cupcake shop but at the same time there was something sterile about the place But that s obviously secondary to the product which needs some improvement And it was kind of overpriced 
-d87ojHd6scx0rxrR3t5cQ Harvard There REALLY needs to be more of these around town It s great to have a healthy alternative to your typical greasy burger joint Their meat is fresh ground sirloin and everything is served on a whole wheat bun Their fries are all fresh cut baked and seasoned They also have the option of fresh lightly sauteed vegetables instead Their milkshakes well more like frappes are amazing and aren t too heavy The place also has wifi so I do my school work here sometimes My only beef is the price is kind of a lot but you re paying for quality in this case Usually a combo with a burger fries and a shake is over 10 which is kind of a lot but not bad when compared to most overpriced delis Also their chicken sandwiches are awfully dry I would stick to the burgers In any given case check it out if in the Harvard area 
-D8nJsMkVNmvSwgGJ61bcQ Harvard The customer service at this chain was dismal at best and it looks as though I m not the only one who thinks so I am a calligrapher and was on my way to a calligraphy consultation and figured I d stop in to see who they deal with when referring brides to calligraphers Well after waiting patiently for them to acknowledge that I wanted to ask a question they had to yell at some tourists to not take pictures in the store first I asked about their policy with calligraphers I got the nastiest response and disgusted look that all I could do was stare them down until they gave me a better answer Really a simple We source that out in a pleasant exchange would have been fine Needless to say I am never going to refer brides to this store in the future Brides can save themselves some aggravation by dealing with ANYONE else without a holier than thou attitude DO NOT SHOP HERE 
-d8zxJCB0xWjQP_PxTKX9w Harvard Me and my townie friend s gummin for lashings of cheap scran since we were so skint from our previous night of arsing around followed by a rough morning involving a shite fall during my run resulting in one banjaxed knee that meant finding an eatin house near my gaff in Central Square VS a Full Irish Breakfast and a short stack of pancakes Full Irish breakfast a wopper bag o shwag of a fry up what brings back the health better than black pudding with a fierce clommel of cloves and nutmeg white pudding filled with suet and oatmeal a deuce of eggs a couple o bangers with beans fried tatos and some toast Suckin diesel man Pancakes complete gobshite and topped with only a screed of banana compote even though the menu made it seem like the star Plus eating them was a fecking dose because they were so crumbly and underdone I didn t want to be a serious neddy though so I declined to send them back Initially we felt completely on our tobler but eventually the usual football crowd dribbled in We didn t want to be a bunch of knackers so I ordered a cup of scaldy and couple of Arthurs rather than some poof juice After I knocked back a jar I relaxed the cacks and joked with the rosspot waitresses who were totally grand and kept the refills coming 
-DBuKOCMzKVGsje7DgOf-g Harvard A lot of potential but it doesn t hit the mark Much better places to grab a beer in the area CBC Lord Hobo The beer list is impressive but like everyone else I swung and missed several times at some great sounding but currently out of stock selections The different measurements for the pour volume is also ridiculous Centiliters Also whoever told my friend to order the pork rinds has a dark sense of humor 
-de8jr_tl5m0EWNyCbEGoA Harvard Decent coffee really good food plenty of space to open your book laptop and space out I had the opportunity to assess the service situation and this is my take The tall skinny moustachio d dude behind the counter appears to be a french american hipster certainly the most insidious species A rare find in the wild they are both rude and judgmental After reading the reviews I came prepared I was hung over wearing sunglasses and my locally ironic cal poly pomona hoodie on I almost felt felt welcome perhaps as much as a half brother would be On a more serious note I think the hipsters behind the counter must be the owners because the lack of courtesy extends beyond what they actually say Am I the only person who noticed that the nicest brightest part of the entire space is the rightmost part of the kitchen 
-dewq6ezYRTgDyCKz8Misw Harvard Wow what a difference a year makes When I lived in Central Square last year this was a run down Burger King frequented by the rougher elements of Central Square Now it s a fancy pants dining establishment that ranks among the best of Cambridge First and foremost the bar Wow What a phenomenal Manhattan Great drinks Our waitress was super friendly and low key which was great Let us take our time which is saying something because it was a Friday night I started with the gnocchi appetizer which as has been noted below is fantastic Perfect for a Boston winter night Dinner was the fish stew which was recommended to me by the waitress I don t recall all the fish that were in there but it was floating in a nice curry sauce with just the right amount of rice and was a treat Great job Only misfire was dessert My wife ordered a strange vanilla flan dish which we just didn t care for Overall a fantastic treat tucked right in the middle of Central Square We ll definitely be back 
-DgERQ1WhNajb6HI1a6sgQ Harvard Had breakfast there today Ordered the My Three Sons and the lox plate Both were huge portions I didn t quite read the full description so I was a little shocked when the most food I have ever seen as one dish showed up 6 1 2 slices of french toast three eggs three slices of bacon three sausage links and home fries A ton of food for 9 99 Unfortunately most of it wasn t very good The eggs were bland the bacon was burnt to a crisp and the home fries were mushy and vaguely sour The french toast was delicious but the syrup was runny and thing The lox plate was ok and had all the trimmings but none of the magic I always leave this place slightly disappointed which is never a good way to start your day 
-dgUfUQjZxSDbdMnfJmdlw Harvard So i ve been here twice now delicious I had a sandwich with their chicken salad with cranberries and apple chunks it was refreshing and not excessive Their house salad dressing is great My boyfriend had a chicken caesar salad which was great the chicken was delish i d recommend this place on a nice day Place your order and sit in the square right outside they bring your food to you so cute 
-dHQPDmzWcy2nIEFIaUNcg Harvard In general I like this place a lot It s located in the Harvard Garage so don t expect anything spectacular in terms of ambiance They serve good pho at a good price I only order pho here so I don t know about other dishes but service is usually pretty quick if average in other ways I rarely have to wait for a table but occasionally do on a busy night In summary I think you get a little more than you pay for and the pho is a nice alternative to other dining options 
-DJsyp2kHQJPCQQaDn0USw Harvard The reviews about service are basically on point but I noticed that if you go into Arrow with low service expectations then you ll be pleasantly surprised They aren t going to roll out a red carpet or even engage you in small talk The food is exceptionally average in terms of crepes nothing to rave about but definitely nothing to complain about I had the Amelie bananas nutella and almonds which combined well with the great crepes batter that Arrow uses to make their delicious food So I leave this review like I left Arrow satisifed but meh 
-DJvwhf-spK7Hkd6tqBArA Harvard I received one of those cards for a free week at wellbridge On the last day I witnessed a personal trainer instructor Eric literally screaming at 2 guests in the pool to the point that one of the guest ran out in tears Eric came up to them and asked if they were both members and they said yes and then he started screaming at them saying that the pool is not to be used for socializing I was there the entire time and the two guests did not do anything wrong were just swimming laps and maybe talking once in a while but not being at all disruptive It was just us three there and I have seen nothing wrong with what they have done 
-dkpN7QWdUMA_4zXhJMSQQ Harvard I like the Middle East I go there sometimes to see shows All different kinds of bands play there small local bands and hugely famous ones Sometimes I go there to eat too They have really great hummus It s a little loud though when you re just trying to eat 
-DNk_ogKmfh1VOPTBR1hzg Harvard Hands down one of the worst venues ive ever partied at Yeah the events can be cool but the venue itself is disgraceful Staff are soooooo rude I was trying to be friendly with everyone but all i got in return were bad mannered A holes of a staff team Other than that the music is good but the venue is so grim dull and dirty Toilets are disgraceful unless walking in puddles of urine is your thing The smell inside the venue is horrendous but i guess thats what you expect in a venue full of sweaty people when there is no air conditioners just furnace style heat lol The mid east seems to be trying way too hard to be something its not it reminds me of those old wash up bars you would find your college professors hanging out at There are much cooler places in Boston you can find good music and people at 
-Dp-Q6HU4tvTx6eariof3A Harvard A perfectly fine gastropub in a very convenient location in Harvard Square literally cater corner to the T Portions on the main dishes are generous and the dishes we tried steak frittes and pan roasted chicken were well seasoned Good beer selection and a nice looking variety of pretty bottles behind the bar for what it s worth we re no experts on mixed drinks While the place looks small from the street it is actually ginormous with a second large bar and dining area downstairs 
-DpDUL87VNQwqVDxAuVZlg Harvard About 3 5 rounded up to 4 I went here with a large group For apps I liked the various dumplings and a spicey fried chicken dish Not a fan of their scallion pancake avoid or hot and sour soup not my style For entrees the taiwanese dishes were the winners I didn t particularly care for the standard americanized chinese offerings which most chinese restaurants are obliged to offer Overall a good option for this area if you stick with this restaurant s strong suit 
-Dpk43PP0VV1H1giZQFKkA Harvard In a world of grooming products and outlets that are geared towards the 20 something female crowd it is a welcome relief to find a men s grooming outlet that is this perfect Like it was yanked out of a 1900 s men s grooming and barbering periodical Colonial Drug remains a Luddite s anachronistic dream No credit cards taken no web presence and this is unbelievable actually don t have enough cash with you No problem just take your merchandise and pay them when you get around to it I m sorry what year is it Although there are some women s products about 70 of the shop is geared towards men Products from Britain Portugal Italy and France line the shelves and the proprietors are knowledgeable and helpful The only complaint I might have is they seem to have a supply problem you get hooked on certain products and when they sell out it seems to take them a very very long time to restock I can find these things online and often do but I would rather give my money to Colonial It really is quite a find 
-DpMnNB7e6-kpPy4FbsjqA Harvard Henrietta s Table gets the bump up to 4 stars because of their great outdoor patio seating I got their Salmon Sandwich with some fresh lemonade both were very good although nothing out of the ordinary They definitely appear to use high quality ingredients in their food A good option in Harvard Square if you re looking for something close to fine dining 
-dv3apx-xbVx5G-kaz0Fjw Harvard The famous Ron Burgundy once said WHAT IS THIS AMATEUR HOUR and no other phrase better describes Shinkansen Bullet Train Teriyaki Normally I wouldn t even bother yelping a place in the MIT student center but after four years I cannot deal with their incompetency anymore If my one star review prevents one poor visiting family or student from eating here then I will have done my duty The teriyaki is pretty bad the service awful the prices high and it s just not satisfying at the end of the meal Yes even their boba bubble tea sucks Even worst they just haven t improved in the four years and I have no reason to believe they will ever 
-dVB1SXmlt8MIZ-psibLEw Harvard Like many others I had a Groupon for a spa mani pedi Reading reviews ahead of time made me skeptical although I figured I would give them the benefit of the doubt and hope for the best Here s a rundown of why my experience was bad at Carriage House Salon After being seated for my manicure I mentioned to my manicurist that I made an appointment for a spa mani pedi She asked if I had a Groupon and told me that Groupon misprinted the information and that it was only good for a regular mani pedi After a little bit of dispute over the issue she asked if I would like to speak with the owner I said yes although he had conveniently left during our conversation She continued to argue that Groupon was at fault and there was nothing she could do Knowing that she was just an employee and had no say on the situation I accepted that I would only be leaving with a regular mani pedi instead of the spa treatment I halfway expected this to be the case before I even got to the salon but it was frustrating nonetheless Even if this had not been an issue I would not return Even though my manicurist Kate did a great job and was very friendly and professional about the whole situation the salon itself is slacking There was only one pedicure chair and it was very disappointing One of my favorite parts about getting a pedicure is getting a massage from the chair This one only vibrated That s a small thing that I would usually overlook but not in this instance I feel bad for the employees at this salon who all seemed nice and like they were doing a good job as this debacle reflects poorly on them The owner on the other hand was rude to me before the whole Groupon issue even came up I was not impressed I do not think that Groupon is at fault here Sometimes Groupon is great for businesses It gets people in the door when they otherwise would not come I think that the owner got a little in over his head with this one ended up losing money and decided to back out on the deal I will continue to use Groupon I will not continue to use this salon 
-dVnRsuu9MfoLgeVk-5O0A Harvard This is the closest pub to my place I m a big fan of their Big Man Ale as well as the pale ale I m not really feelin the Amber They have a decent pub grub menu and respectable bar The growlers are a bit pricey but worth it if you want microbrew freshness 
-DXtJCCHponJAUUwcpVVUg Harvard I came here for a brunch on a cold Sunday morning so can t speak much to the nightlife nor dinner menu However the atmosphere was nice and the food was for the most part good Nothing really blew me away As far as sticking to the them I did notice the regular menu written in period table format on the wall which seems to be the key feature of the restaurant I ll give it to them that was very cool Food was even grouped by themed into the columns and for the most part increased in price as you traveled from the top of the column to the bottom With the exception of the skewers whats up with that guys I ordered the sourdough french toast with grilled banana I was a bit disappointed that those two items were completely separate from one another on my plate and it was only half of a grilled banana which could be rationed over only about 3 4 bites of my french toast So I basically had an order of sourdough french toast It was good but nothing special My boyfriend had the breakfast wrap Again good but nothing amazing The side of potatoes was phenomenal though We were both a bit hungry and the guys at the next table had the egg sandwich which was packed with toppings and looked amazing We ordered a 3rd meal one of those to split and it was quite fantastic I d skip the french toast and order that first if I went back Other items to note the waitress had originally charged me extra for the grilled banana on the bill extra 2 50 before I pointed out it was listed as coming with the dish on the menu She explained it was her first brunch and apologized and corrected it quickly Also the coffee maker was broken and no coffee was available when we arrived at about 10 am on a Sunday I find that unacceptable Go buy a cheap 12 cup maker down the street or buy resell a to go crate of it from dunkin donuts Don t deny your morning customers coffee Oh and the table in the middle of the room seems customized designed and is absolutely awesome Where can I get one 
-DyTws4oZnz0xnVxWcK5PA Harvard Went there this past Sunday evening Was impressed with variety of sushi menu I went with two great friends all were craving sushi and we weren t dissapointed Favorites the pizza roll I initially was ambivalent pizza roll but it had everything texture taste and just so delicious I will definitely go back Only complaint wish they had better assortment of cocktails 
-dz0yFCaj1OJbjBJvTFQog Harvard Over rated and overlooked It s nice for the older fourty plus crowd Bland if u ask me 
-D_845a6GdZkIHsAxtjIKQ Harvard Unfortunately mediocre There are several better restaurants nearby so I m unsurprised the place is frequently empty The food is not outstanding in any way and the service is really indifferent On the most recent visit there was such a problem splitting the check with two credit cards that the cards actually disappeared for more than 10 minutes That kind of thing makes me really twitchy and I don t think I will go back 
-E3B0StKN2Qjgf3dzL2r6w Harvard Economy Hardware is more of a home decor store now than a hardware store The home decor section is a huge room with chairs lamps stools clocks organizers and other items you might want But none of these things are economical They also sell some kitchen gadgets The hardware section is limited to a back room crammed with tools paint and other items The selection is not good and neither are the prices Try pills hardware up the street 
-e70zk1eWQ9wHaVK8d4FNg Harvard Mr Bartley s is fun and I take friends and visitors there whenever I get a chance The burgers are made thick not flattened like a baseball on a bun just like I like it I always order a specialty burger and so far I have simply LOVED the ones with ooey gooey boursin cheese The Steve Jobs iBurger is my favorite boursin mushrooms and onions but since the names and flavors change all the time it may not be around forever I prefer the sweet potato fries to the regular fries in my opinion it s worth the extra dollar or so to substitute Mr Bartley s is definitely touristy but the food is good and the atmosphere is fun Make sure you bring cash 
-E78Jv6UIa0EnjVrfi8E5Q Harvard Great service very friendly accommodating prompt etc We had the ramp brebis and focaccia appetizer and it was DELICIOUS I had the paella next and it was good not too salty but for the price I would ve expected a bit more seafood Topped it off with cappuccinos which were also very good I d go back if I were in the area for a nice dinner It s definitely pricey but you pay for the whole experience

-eaKtdKWzwmfS5-Vn7DOdA Harvard Maybe I just didn t order the right thing I was just definitely not WOWed and to be quite honest a little sad I ordered an 8 oz Mocha which ended up costing me 4 50 50 is tip Thats ABSURD It wasn t even the best I ve had it was actually pretty mediocre Ugh I am willing to give this place another try but I think I need to read other Yelper s suggestions and pick something on the more unique side maybe then I ll bump up the stars The service was great though Very personable

-ebUxNdGR6OBx_wGd_L1sw Harvard The Traditional Irish Stew they quote to be one of this establishment s favorites was by far the worst stew I ve ever tasted the chunks of veggies were as large as golf balls there were perhaps _three_ little fatty and undercooked pieces of lamb and the broth was more or less a stirred ketchup Served lukewarm The waiter spilled some beer while putting it on our table and never bothered to wipe it off and never asked about my untouched meal Take your money and dine elsewhere 
-edOrcdWGnNLodyAEadUKA Harvard Maybe it s nostalgia from undergrad but I still love Toscii s their mexican chocolate ice cream their micro sundaes happy sigh i love their home made fudge sauce and freshly whipped cream i only wish they posted their flavors on line alas i m not a beer gal but the fact that they have a guinness sp flavour amuses me oh and extra props on having a child s cone for our 3 year old and at a reasonable price you guys are the best love ya

-eGlLAeQ6ZUmAehFPfoRZA Harvard I love this place because the location decor and attitude is so unassuming that the food is shockingly delicious The spicy pad thai is classic Wash it down with a fresh lime soda drink that they make on the spot reminds me of the street side vendors in India The triangular crab rangoon is also a solid choice because it is different from what you ll expect

-eIr7TRBKcWjxOvstzx_yw Harvard Nothing is more Boston in my estimation than Newbury Comics Despite the name comics have little if anything to do with it Back when I used to buy CDs they had a great selection and I am sure they still do if I bothered to persue This location also has an extravagant amount of DVDs and books magazines They also have posters action figures hats belts t shirts legwear keychains earring buttons ahhhh Newbury Comics harkens back to a time when a store like this was exciting before you could buy it cheaper on Ebay But the fact is the excitement of an old fashioned all purpose counter culture supermarket is unmatched by a clinical thumbnail filled cyberstore that doesnt even have the capability to condescend to you In any case I prefer to examine and cradle the unnecessary and overpriced item I may be coveting at the moment before replacing it back from whence it came because I lack the funds to purchase it 
-EJMCP-rIFBTX7TsE9hrag Harvard This place should be banished to the food court hall of shame Overpriced tasteless pizza brown lettuce and shriveled up cold cuts of the unhealthy variety salami pastrami hummus with a dark patina that shows off its antiquity horrific greasy chicken all located in a most unappealing space The only positives little kids don t care about any of the above and it s easy to get to from the Marriott If you are staying there and need a quick snack you don t need to go outside Nice for some people if it is pouring rain but frankly I d walk up to Central Square or over to Inman Square in a historic hail storm rather than go into this depressing place again With the terrific food trucks right across the street I can t believe this food court stays alive MIT geniuses create a business plan for this place that brings in some healthy well priced local food and a friendlier eating environment This is just a tragedy

-Ek_xjV6g-2F43OSX_KpvQ Harvard Whoever thought to put mashed sweet potatoes on a breakfast sandwich and then make it a little spicy was a genius I haven t eaten anything else there because I ve only been twice for breakfast but damn that was delicious I will be back next time I m in town 
-EK_yPUCkR1tbLopOPdudQ Harvard So I said to my friend I have a random German guy visiting me for a week and tonight I d like to take him out to pizza But not just pizza you know I want pizza plus plus something something extra And my friend declared Mein freund CAMBRIDGE 1 It was wonderful Great modern atmosphere which was packed to the gills with people You ll definitely have to wait but they manage crowds well On a Friday night at 7 30 PM our group of three had to wait only 20 minutes and even snagged seats at the bar for beers for the wait Nestled in Harvard Square it s a great place to take people from out of town and easily has something on the menu for everyone When we reached our seats placed our orders and quickly got our pizzas we were in heaven Charcoal grilled thin crust pizzas portobello roasted onion and asiago for me killer italian sausage ricotta tomato and fontina for my friend wowwy she said and hot cherry peppers black forest ham and manchego for our German acquaintance he seriously dug it Our waitress was great The house red was great All around great The moral of the story is I m pretty sure any one can enjoy Cambridge 1 which is a something I previously thought was only possible to say about smiles rainbows and kittens So go enjoy Danke 
-ENFDZ2NG4hdBvrLe9m6-A Harvard After having just cabbed it to Harvard Square my wife and I walked out of a bookstore and Curious George was staring at us Our two year old son is a huge Curious George fan It was theme for his second birthday and he watches it everyday The store is amazing they have almost everything Georgie as my son would say as well as many other books and other items for children We spent about 50 and could have spent more The only downside was that they were out of t shirts for toddlers The problem was that the store lost their licensing agreement I thought that was a bit strange considering that Margaret Ray helped design the store and used to live a block and a half away

-ePP7wD6hJpysTKv2hXR6A Harvard Algiers is a well decorate cute and inviting cafe conveniently located in Harvard Sq The top floor was quite and had lots of open seating which was great for studying or reading The service was a bit slow but friendly Unfortunately they served one of the worst latte s I ve ever had It had no foam luke warm milk and weak espresso and it was 4 50 It looked and tasted more like a cafe au late so I asked the server if this was a latte and she said yes hence confirming my worst latte award I m a big fan or local coffee houses don t mind paying for good coffee but this was overpriced for the quality so 2 stars for the ambiance 0 stars for the latte I may come back to try some Arabic coffee since it a very cute charming cafe but I won t be rushing back anytime soon 
-erpUZ0rm4yGQnvLTzm71Q Harvard Pinocchio s is the only place I feel comfortable eating in Harvard Square they are fast reliable and I never feel like I m being cheated price wise because of the location If I don t feel like cooking for a few days I ll stop by and grab a small Sicilian for 22 that will feed me and my fiance for 3 days The guys who work here are friendly and make everyone feel welcome even though they get pretty crowded during peak hours they only have 5 tables As yelpers have noted the Sicilian crust is to die for and if your hunger is average a single slice is pretty filling a meal for me is usually 3 slices shared between me and my fiance The subs are also delicious albeit crazy greasy A few notes you need to buy about 3 slice or a sub if you want to use a debit credit card they have a 7 credit card min and one slice is 2 25 If you re ordering a whole pizza to go you probably want to do it by phone about 30 minutes before you want to pick it up because there s not a lot of room to wait around inside Everything else has been said Pinocchio s is my go to place for cheap greasy delicious Italian street food 
-ESacjZ7zVpvS_ItO9sZOA Harvard This place is the best as far as jewelry stores go They have a huge selection that s a variety of styles and prices I came here to buy a gift for a mom and ended up buying something for me too The layout of the store is great easy to browse The staff is friendly and helpful You can tell just from looking inside that this place is the tops 
-eTDWkc99ZrDpnHpvPaoOw Harvard A hip area to hang out in Bars to check out and venues to see There is always something going on 
-EuAIf8RB6-NWNBquXnK5w Harvard I think Anna s is one of the Boston area s most overrated taquerias After 4 years at MIT I ve given this place more than enough opportunities to redeem itself but I m still unsatisfied I ve tried just about everything from the burritos to the tacos to the rice plates to the chips and dip I will say that the guacamole is delicious and I love their Mexican drinks horchata and jamaica Those are definitely worth trying They also have refreshing lemonade but recently it seems like they have been using that cheap artificial lemon flavor So sad The meats are usually bland and if not bland super fatty I thought al pastor was supposed to be super fatty and greasy until I spent my summer in Mexico City The real stuff is well seasoned and pretty lean Nonetheless I will admit that Anna s is filling It s the kind of meal you can scarf down in 5 mins run back to class or work and be nourished for half the day But it s not that tasty and you ll probably feel gross and bloated afterwards 
-EybfJNQFABxV0IlAoqXBQ Harvard this place has a really fun and mod interior design theme going on inside i didn t try the sushi but the korean food was great i had chap chae and the bulgogi both were fantastic 
-EzouGl4OK5TtAirXZPBFw Harvard Great food and great price A huge bowl of tasty rice noodle soup costs only 6 One down side too much soup and not enough noodles But considering the price I think i really should not complaint too much The place has a great atmosphere perfect for dinner There is a cute bar attached to it I have seen people sitting at the bar eating noodle soup perhaps it makes you look cooler There is also a small private room at the back so you can ask for that particular seating if you want to have some private talk with friends Overall I think it s great Good quality of food atmosphere ordinary service for a very inexpensive price 
-e_10FRrGMI4S4zWBF5Fjg Harvard On a Friday or Saturday evening there is often a long wait and they do not take reservations One tip I can offer you is that is you tell the bartender you want to eat a meal at the bar they will give the seat to you before a drinker by placing a reserved sign over the newly emptied seats The real draw of this place is the bar and their extensive eclectic cocktail list I got a drink that was muddled strawberries with basil and vodka it was very good I was most impressed by the crowd that goes here it made for some great people watching The decor is also very cool most of the staff is dressed in extravagant clothing from the early 1900 s What holds this place back a little bit is their food While not short on creativity there were some great dishes and others that just didn t work as well That shouldn t steer you away the food is still better than most places Here is what I had Bread Basket You have to pay a few bucks for it but the bread is great comes out warm and has olive oil for dipping Seafood Avocado One of the highlights It is basically a cerviche served inside a hollowed perfectly ripe avocado with a side of lobster tail Sizzling Garlic Shrimp Pretty much what the title says The shrimp themselves were on the smaller side This actually also makes a great dipping sauce for your bread Cuban Cigar Short rib inside a filo dough roll It does strangely resemble a cigar It is served with a bean salad It was good but wasn t crazy about the spices they use on the short rib Thai Mussels Not a fan of these I believe it was the overdose of basil in the broth that was the turn off 
-f6h8vv6Zkc7tT76DvDYMQ Harvard Why did they change their coffee and what happened to the great breakfast sandwiches This was my go to place in the summer great patio seating fantastic coffee and even better breakfast sandwich Between bad weather and other plans this was my first visit this summer I hated the new coffee and the sandwich was just not the same I am deeply disappointed Is there a new owner What happened 
-f8N9ddbKEu8jJOcYUqu5g Harvard First floor Apparently this place was recently renovated it was well worth it The decor was relaxing comfortable nothing like other Hong Kongs I ve been to with cheesy dragons paintings on the wall The food was inexpensive 7 50 for my plate just under 9 for hubby s Our dinners came almost immediately after we finished our 1st round of drinks which were not all fruity watered down as others have mentioned The plate was full but not overwhelmingly so therefore no major food coma induced I had a combo plate with chicken fingers crab rangoons fried rice though the fried rice could have used some onion or spice the crab rangoons were perfect Third floor We met our friends for the Comedy Studio show Hong Kong provides food drink there as well The crab rangoons were just as tasty we had many scorpion bowls I was a bit disappointed with them as they weren t as potent as I m used to for 15 you would think they would knock me on my ass Anyways all in all a good place for dinner drinks though you may want to avoid the scorpion bowl 
-f9fBALuzh0_vJoprOYtgg Harvard A confession I didn t buy anything It s a gourmet store and I m unemployed Ramen is an extravagance for me However this store was a BLAST to walk around and window shop in excitedly looking forward to when my budget is friendlier to a splurge Though the staff was clearly available to assist if I needed it no one bothered me or made me feel guilty that I was just browsing Cardullo s made me realize just how sheltered I am with food It was an invigorating and exciting revelation I foresee some awesome meals in my future and new favorite foods 
-faApQvYK9OUVIjTcKB52w Harvard This receives the same review as the Faneuil Hall location That s the thing about chains you know what you re going to get in terms of quality regardless of location on average The thing that I liked a little more about this location than the F H one less tourists I heart wagamama I have never repeat never had a bad experience when visiting a wagamama The servers all assist one another so you are well taken care of The food has always been good I would lick the plate clean if that were acceptable behavior and there are a good number of things I like on the menu One downside to Wagamama is that it has group seating They are going to seat your party of however many people next to other parties on picnic style benches If that sort of thing bothers you then you re not going to be comfortable and it will ruin your dining experience Speaking of the tables they have these place mats on them and the servers take your order and write the down on your placemat The first time I came here I was caught a little off guard by this but whatever if that s their thing doesn t bother me All I care about is that my food is brought to me in a decent amount of time it s made well my service is friendly and I feel like I received a good value and Wagamama delivers on those items 
-fB_TMhiaMF6zx7WfEI25A Harvard In the spirit of self care after running a week long conference I decided to head to Pyara Spa in Harvard Square I called on a Friday morning and was able to fit into a 11am massage with Elizabeth followed by a pedicure manicure with Ira I checked in and was escorted back to the sitting area I was offered tea or water I chose the tea which was delightful The receptionist told me that I was having my massage with Elizabeth and that Elizabeth was awesome happy Elizabeth greeted me with a warm smile Before entering the treatment room Elizabeth led me to a little scent station I will call it so that I could select the aroma oil she would use during my massage This was a very cool process and it was all of 3 minutes I was already feeling relaxed and totally excited AND Elizabeth is SO NICE We then walked into the room where I was to have my massage Elizabeth filled a basin with some water and used some of their product yay smelled so good and washed my feet in such a gentle way my feet were so happy While she was doing this she was asking me about what I liked or did not like in a massage and about some of the areas that I held tension she asked me about pressure etc I LOVED that she asked me these questions Sometimes I am thinking about what bothers me but forget to mention it because I am so excited about the massage LOL in any case I thought this was important and very professional of her to ask The massage was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC I was SOOO relaxed and totally felt AMAZING afterward I am definitely going to go back and request Elizabeth She also has such a warm demeanor She knows her stuff and is super nice I slept like a rock that evening and a big ups for the products which are amazing and smell sooo good My pedi mani afterwards was equally amazing Ira is such a sweet woman She and I had some chit chat but it was pretty limited during my pedi because I was still in la la land after my massage She seemed to understand and was totally cool not trying to push conversation or anything She was also great in helping me pick a color I m a plain jane and I wanted something nice but not too crazy Ira had the perfect color in mind I LOVE IT When we got to the manicure table we talked a little bit more about random things I was also asking her about my nails and hands as they have been in rough shape She took care of me and my nails and feet look fantastic I will also request Ira again soon Many people have commented on the front desk staff They seemed okay to me I have been in there several times only to purchase products and I have run into some front desk dooozzzzers on occasion Overall however I say that for the service you get during the actual treatments and for the price this place rocks 
-fH-14ETMFS4JuCTHx2IjQ Harvard Went here today after eating lunch at Cafe Luna I heard it was reknown for great ice cream and wanted to give it a try The ice cream was decent but it was too creamy for my taste The vibe was nice but I ve had ice cream that was more refreshing to me So if you enjoy super thick and creamy ice cream then you would probably like this I wasn t a huge fan but maybe its because I m from California where the ice cream is less thick 
-FHAMHazFhFCMabWSAJsfA Harvard Alright I m going to risk contradicting the crowd this is one of my favorite pubs Although I do agree that I was a little shaken by the Norse name referring to an Irish Pub You d think that someone opening a restaurant would do a little research and at least get the correct culture I like the decor It feels very comfortable warm and inviting I ve chatted up most of the bar staff and once you get them going it s a pretty friendly group There s plenty of seating although the place is always packed on a weekend evening and seating is generally not available at those times I even managed to train one of the senior bartenders in one of my favorite drinks that no one ever knows how to make he did a great job There have been several drinks that the bar was not equipped to make in spite of the fact that the bar seems very well stocked but the bar manager is always willing to offer solutions compromises and alternate recommendations As far as my general bar experiences this place is the best of all the spots in the Boston area that I ve visited so far The food is another point worth mentioning Everything that I ve tried at the Asgard Irish American fare has been above average tasty The portion sizes are also large I m always on a quest for good Shepherd s Pie and the stuff here is the second best I ve had the best sadly being at a bar in Dorchester The chili is average to good many of the deserts are awesome just good food The Asgard also claims to have live music from time to time on the weekends but everytime I ve been in on a weekend the band was unable to play for some reason lead singer sick etc So I ve gotta disagree with many of the people who have posted here the Asgard is definitely worth a stop whether you re looking for good food good bartending or a comfortable atmosphere 
-fHUP6HAu8oEjAhj0kgqmA Harvard Visited this establishment a while back and thought it had a really nice atmosphere and great service but unfortunately my food experience was a little disappointing At least half of the dishes I had on my tasting menu were not cooked well or were underwhelming I had really looked forward to the six course tasting here having heard so much about it In many ways I was impressed We had technically more than just six courses if you count the lovely jasmine infused panna cottas that were complementary I may have had an irregular experience but tastings aren t things I can afford to try multiple times at the same place if my experience the first time was mediocre I really loved the salad and desserts but am terribly disappointed by the pork belly It was unbelievably salty The same can be said for the other meat dishes and makes me wonder if I just got the bottom of the pot they did say at first that they ran out Aside from the meats I did thoroughly enjoy the unique flavor and pairings of the other dishes but being a meat lover not having a well flavored meat dish put quite the damper on my evening 
-FHYkx_9einYF1D-PqsTyQ Harvard This restaurant is worth every dollar you spend there Fine dining at it s absolute best in Cambridge The place is spotless intimate cozy warm inviting the staff treat you as if you are coming into their home The food is prepared as art and cooked perfectly I had a wonderful birthday experience here my boyfriend and I devoured everything on our plates and excitedly shared bites If you re looking for a place for a special occasion and you prefer a small intimate local hidden jewel type of experience this is it 
-FI-hdEKc9Hp3m52lLZYVQ Harvard Central Square is undergoing some changes many not for the better The gentrification and Disneyfication that have overwhelmed Harvard Square are threatening its dirtier hipper neighbor The difference is that Central seems to be fighting back While some of the new places boast prices that would have earned derision not too long ago they aren t all the soulless bland restaurants and clubs you might expect with rising rents and incomes The Middlesex Lounge and others are hosting nights with underground dance music while the Middle East and TT s hold down Mark Sandman Square admirably following the loss of neighbor Manray You can still find cheap food after hours and parking is the best in the city due to the public lots on Bishop Allen and cheap garage on Green Street But now you can also get classy shitfaced sipping cocktails at Green St or Craigie on Main and even get a decent meal that won t scare your date away Change can be good Note on other reviews if you think Williamsburg Brooklyn and the Mission San Francisco were up and coming in 2006 you have officially voided all credibility Central isn t an up and coming hip spot it s been a center for Boston area underground culture for years 
-FLhmZCsPoA0UoxGUizHuw Harvard I often browse Yelp but never take the time to write reviews but I love this place too much not to publicly vouch for it Kevork is the nicest person ever and despite only going there a few times a year he always remembers me and makes time for me On top of being the best customer service they are extremely helpful in getting the right care for me keeping in mind that I m a student with no eye insurance and very limited budget My contacts are always there the next day after I order I would not ever consider going anywhere else

-FTGnc1R1oH8LBCBfc8ATg Harvard I hadn t been to Paradise in more than year before my bachelor party but I was thinking it was a perfectly trashy place to conclude our night We walked in and upstairs were the same old men hitting on twinks Brazillian strippers and big screen porn that I remembered Then we went downstairs to get drinks Um holy crap The mirrored wall is gone and replaced with more space and a third bar and A BATHROOM THAT ISN T SKETCHY AS ALL HELL But not to worry the sketchy bathrooms are still there too The drinks are still strong there was no cover I think we got there just after midnight and the music was good Honestly I think I could come here for a drink every now and then It was the perfectly trashy way to end the night 
-fUONiIWlE4giFVYLiMkYQ Harvard That s it I m doing it I m entering the fray of the burrito wars And I m casting my vote firmly on the side of Chipotle I freely admit though that I don t eat a lot of meat so my comparisons are all based on the vegetarian options My first of many burrito experiences started as many do at Anna s I was hooked But after awhile the surliness of the staff wore thin at least let me answer about what I want before you start slopping things on there So I moved on to Boca Grande And it was good And then it wasn t quite as good I wanted something fresher And lo there was Chipotle The guac oh the guac It s creamy and has just a slight tang of lime and they make it fresh all day so it s actually green not a sad faded brown looking at you Boca G I ve tried three locations and the Harvard Sq one has the best burrito rollers hands down Dedham is hit or miss and Brighton Cleveland Circle are second tier at best The tasty ingredients make up for a lot though I like the hot salsa although if you re used to a lot of heat I am it s not really that hot but it has a great flavor I think their pinto beans have some meat in them so I go for the black beans and I ask them to go light on the rice because sometimes they mound it on there 
-fVHBKcYpTGgMv7BICJpOg Harvard The Brattle Theatre in concept is wonderful play classic films cult films new films that otherwise won t get much play in the area I love the fact that this place exists In practice however the Brattle needs some work In a city with so much cutting edge technology the sound and projection here are woefully sub par Seeing a film on the big screen from actual film is a great idea but not if the print sucks or if the sound is bad In those cases I d really rather they popped in a DVD A major studio film from the 90s should not look as if they salvaged the print from a flooded vault As for concessions I like the tea selection and fair trade coffee It s cool that they use real butter but if the popcorn is stale as it sometimes is what s the point Perhaps it s a funding issue I ve never seen the theater full when I ve been there Maybe they can t afford to upgrade But if they want to survive I think they need to find a patron or underwriter Film buffs might continue to go since this is the only place to do what it does But it won t attract many casual visitors if it doesn t step up the game a bit 
-FWPnaJOytxCTOor7Ym5WQ Harvard Location is fantasic for people watching The inside is sleek and nice with a decent beer selection The menu is a bit different and the service was quite slow considering we were there on a Saturday afternoon and there were only 3 other tables with people at them The food was alright but I really don t think I would go back The idea is there but something is missing 
-FZVTkagn3Q7JJXqEyb31g Harvard I go here for a couple reasons They have a decent beer selection and they are close to my house That s about it They are kind of overpriced which is not uncommon in the city but most places that cost this much have more interesting stuff to try Also the six packs are always incomplete or mixed up so even if they have what you want you might not be able to find a complete sixer of it Seriously the entire beer section is a mess I hate it You have to shuffle everything around just to get a simple six pack which should be an easy grab and go situation Also all their decent booze is behind the counter so either you loiter around the counter and look like you are cutting in line or you don t know what they actually have until you re paying Stupid Also I have terrible eyesight and can t tell half of what is up there even from the counter so I have to ask and I hate doing that I am now in the habit of stocking up on beer from Atlas whenever we go to Quincy so I won t have to shop here as often 
-g2eijeYC-e8gxScAoZQ8g Harvard My girlfriend and I had been craving Indian food for some time The cravings came in waves and this time it found us while we were walking around leisurely in Harvard Square So into Tanjore we went It was a weekend around 6 00 PM and the place was completely empty Not to be deterred we sat down and ordered our usual boring Indian choices Chicken Tikka Masala and a Combo Plate The food was as Yelp describes 3 stars A OK The sauces were a bit too sweet and the chicken should have been more tender Awesomely enough though the leftovers were super delicious the next day straight out of the fridge I also seem to remember from my times as a student that the menu was split into regional Indian cuisines North Indian South Indian and some other regions I m sure I have it all wrong but there were no longer these divisions on the menu I d suggest trying elsewhere for better Indian food 
-G2UTkyHKZOVWoe4QlsAsg Harvard Damn if they don t have the worst coffee I ve had in a long time It s like three day old gas station coffee bad It tastes like battery acid and not in a good way Or to put it another way ABP s coffee blows Cosi s out of the water And ABP coffee is fucking terrible

-G74BD64Cug7Igh7qx_Jdg Harvard Cheapest double burger and brew in the City 10 done and done Good fries too Only bad thing limited seating gets pretty packed The server also tried to short change us once which was pretty annoying But overall I really love this place Parking is TOUGH though and the lot next door even w validation is 12 00 even if you re only there an hour The staff is also awesome b c I left my wallet there didn t realize till the next morning frantically raced over to get it and they had it all contents present and accounted for ps there s seating upstairs too if downstairs is crowded 
-g9PIlPwsHAuFa8rFqVprA Harvard Any five star review of this place is inexplicable I m guessing the five stars are from either morons idiots or people trying to be ironic There is a special level of hell for perpetrators of this kind of garbage They ll be taking laps in Satan s Olympic sized pool o flames fire and brimstone along with the owners of Cheesecake Factory Applebee s and Dick s Last Resort Let s begin the hatefest shall we The official laundry list of why Border Cafe might be hell on earth 1 It s about 85 degrees in there at all times I like 85 degrees when I m on the beach or on vacation or when I m in a sauna but not when I m getting ready to try to choke down what passes as food at this joint 2 It s so fucking crowded with douchebags people with babies women trying to pick up douchebags and Harvard undergrads trying to get a margarita without getting carded you can t breathe let alone move 3 The margaritas are really sub par Not well mixed Not salted properly And I m pretty sure they use the same margarita mix you can pick up at Stop and Shop 4 Hey waiter guy do you really need to check our IDs again when 1 we are all clearly in our late 20s early 30s and 2 we are still carrying around out shittily mixed margaritas No not really but thanks for making us dig those out again for the umpteenth time that night Really appreciate your thoroughness and attention to detail Too bad you didn t extend such skills to actually getting the drinks we ordered to us C est la vie 5 The food Any place but Boston and this shit on a plate would not be tolerated I don t get it Bostonians are generally known for a few things being assholes liking the Red Sox throwing tea into the harbor and being wicked smart cause we all go to all these fucking colleges in town The last item on the list and heck even the first does not compute with Bostonian love of all bad Mexican food It s like we have a complex we don t think we deserve good Mexican food so we go around eating this shit thinking it s the best we can do We have low Mexican food self esteem Can t we all just agree to go cut ourselves take the angst level up a notch and then demand a fucking good TexMex place in Boston or Cambridge city proper 6 I ve cracked the recipe for their queso dip Go to the Stop and Shop so you can also recreate their margaritas head to the processed cheese aisle pick up a pound of Velveeta throw in a bottle of ChiChi s salsa and set it to nuke in your microwave for five minutes Voila Bon Apetit 7 And don t get me started on their Creole Cajun offerings It s even more offensive than the Tex Mex they throw on your plate 8 My husband while trying to push his way to the bar to get us drinks hears this Hey Brah watch it dude Brah For realz It appears that Brody Jenner and the Bromance crew hang out in the bar area of Border Cafe on Friday nights 9 There is an hour long wait to eat in this hell hole A full 60 minutes Longer if your group is on the large side You can count on 90 minutes for your standing pleasure 10 There s a Tom of Finlandesque cowboy mural on the wall in the basement Oh wait That s kinda awesome Two stars it is

-gEvrPids_g0Nv6lZeU1ag Harvard I tried this out with my coworker since he saw it on tv He was raving about the lobster mac and cheese The line was a little slow so we ended up ordering more food that we were planning to We tried the lobster brioche sliders with Asian fusion sauce a shot of the clam chowder and the lobster mac and cheese I loved the slider The bread iggys and the flavor of the lobster was a great combination Too bad it is so small The shot of the chowder was great too I heard that the lobster bisque was delicious as well I wasn t a huge fan of the mac and cheese I liked the scoop of lobster and lobster bisque that they poured onto the mac and cheese just not the mac Prices are a bit higher compared to the portions If I have a craving for lobster rolls I ll go again 
-GfiIPGdm1XOJeCSVubO7Q Harvard This is a soccer bar Come here if you want to watch soccer and not be bothered by the waitstaff as they seemed very inattentive towards visiting your table or even to bring you your drink The food offerings especially the hamburgers on the menu seemed to be interesting However opting for the buffalo fries instead was a mistake on my part as they were soggy and undercooked and felt as if someone had just thrown some random condiments on a pile of microwaved leftover fries from the night before Furthermore don t expect the rare to the area craft beers on the menu to still be on tap so you ll be stuck with the more standard beer fare at normal to higher than usual prices On the plus side the trivia they offer on Wednesday nights is a decent change from the standard offerings with challenging questions However the trivia hosts lack a real presence and struggle to truly keep the audience engaged as they plug along through questions at a disinterested pace The most obvious sign that this is a place to pass on unless you re a die hard soccer fan was the attitude of our waitress who came over as we were leaving and asked if we were planning on tipping more despite us having left an appropriate 15 amount despite having to go out of our way to get any attention at our table This certainly speaks volumes of the type of service offered here and we will not be coming back 
-gGGwsADkvjaXXHBU9bVPg Harvard Ahhhhhhh I wanna scream I m so excited to tell you about how great this place is Tip 1 when you first walk in check the bar There s always at least 25 mins of waiting for the tables so why not grab a seat at the bar You will get more attentive service that way because the bartenders are always around and you won t loose your cool because of waiting Hands down the best breakfast place in the entire Boston screaming out loud from a Vietnamese that grew up eating noodle soups and banh mi for breakfast Hands down the weirdest decoration that I ve ever seen at a breakfast joint Hands down the busiest breakfast place that can handle their customers with the best service possible Hands down the worst coffee ever but it s okay you can give me their French Toast and Pumpkin pancake and i will be happy as a clam Oh hands down the best French Toast ever I always have trouble selecting what to eat here because there are too many to choose from However the specials on the white board by the bar always help I usually go here with another friend on Sat or Sun morning It doesn t matter what we order we have to share either a side of pancake or french toast otherwise he she will no longer be my friend LOL no not to that extreme Oh did I tell you that drinks here are crazy good as well They have a wide variety of beers drafts and cocktails that I ve never seen anywhere else While waiting for your orders which might take awhile since they are packed all the time you can enjoy all the mock labels at the bar vintage labels that you have not seen since the 70 s 80 s One time our order took more than 45 minutes to arrive which I didn t care because I was talking to my friends about the labels at the bar the entire time The bartender maybe manager offered a 50 discount to make us happy Friendly Toast people are just plain awesome Thanks guys 
-gHO51l5V3qETcDyQUgahQ Harvard Hands down my favorite restaurant in Boston I have been here more times than I can count and the staff is always incredibly friendly and glowing The drinks are classic in nature The wine list pairs almost too well with the menu The beef tongue is mouth watering The french gnocchi is savory The catfish is one of the best prepared fish dishes in the city Also the deserts are worth saving room for un notch the belt one more hole 
-gHSYfWzs8Io6djFE8bALQ Harvard Oh Le s where are you going Wait don t answer that I ll do it Downhill that s where you re going Back in the day when you were still called Pho Pasteur you were pretty darn good and cheap to boot Now your prices have gone up and your pho has gotten significantly worse Like every other eatery in Harvard Square you re overpriced and resting far too heavily on your laurels I keep making the mistake of coming here since I live close thinking that maybe the last time was a fluke It s not Four times in a row the food has been consistently subpar The only reason Le s seems to stay around is because there s basically no competition Final note What s up with the LEMON in my pho It used to be limes like every other pho restaurant on the planet now they re cheaping out so hard they re giving us lemons wth Bottom Line Service is OK food has gone way downhill Two Stars 
-ghVKuA0CsGUu4cnt69ivg Harvard The hostess came by the table 30 minutes after seating us to let us know that there were people coming in after us and that we should be mindful of the time We ignored this comment as it seems somewhat ridiculous and ate a decent but definitely overpriced meal Then as we were waiting for our friend to return from the bathroom the hostess returned to our table to remind us that we had exceeded our two hour time limit and essentially asked us to leave When we confronted them that we had never experienced this type of treatment before the owner came over introduced himself and said I am the owner We didn t know what to say to that He then defended the hostess at one point rolling his eyes at our discontent I have never received service this poor in my life I should also mention that at the beginning of the night when there was a thunderstorm going on three of the people at our table had drops of water land on our shoulder head and hands To remedy this problem they moved our table two feet over after which we continued to feel occasion drops that went ignored 
-Gj13O7kkFfDGKNR5PK-jg Harvard I enjoy Au Bon Pain I live and work near the Galleria and even though I hate that mall I get food there all the time The food is fresh and has flavor Its one of the better chain eateries for a quick bite to eat The set up is bit confusing and sometimes there signage is messed up but over all it s pretty good 
-gjZZOjv11BgkjdWF-Z-RQ Harvard Boston Costume is a great source for anything costume related I ve rented a full costume and bought small pieces for theater work While the prices aren t cheap I ve managed to find some bargains in the off season 8 for long red gloves meant for a sexy Mrs Claus costume were easily modified for a children s play and were cheaper than the 15 run of the mill red gloves on the next rack The store is always staffed with knowledgeable friendly staff though it is understandably a crazy place during Halloween 
-GKgsgZBmzYTuRxqMfNGAA Harvard Received a great haircut When I get my hair cut I get it relatively short and with a taper in the back The barber knew just what to do and was very friendly Much preferred over the hair cuttery and similar places so don t be deterred by the hole in the wall feel They don t accept credit cards so remember to bring enough money for 14 plus tip 
-Gn8Iaxx9u48PtCboYnFVw Harvard I came by here for the first time on Saturday night for post dinner drinks Despite countless times that I had walked down Mt Auburn St and seen this place I had never actually gone in It s actually a nice place The bar is relatively chill and the bartender was cool his interest was piqued when I started talking about the dollar oysters at McCormick s Schmicks The tap has a distinctively good list of beers including Berkshire Brewing as well as your general standards and it s a nice place Sadly the appetizers seem to end a bit early but other than that I d go back easily 
-gOhsHhqiFYR2COq2TZ1Yw Harvard 5 stars for Roads because it is the perfect place to make memories during your college years I guess there is nothing too special about the bar it s kinda small downstairs has good seating and is a good place to sit and talk Upstairs is loud often crowded with MIT kids darts and a big screen tv The free pizza with each pitcher on Wednesdays is a must The pizza comes out hot and delicious Trivia nights on Sundays is always fun too The music at Roads is actually usually pretty good too albeit repetitive to those who are always there 
-GQrUE7abCeYII3yhQ55iw Harvard Okay so this is my spot for lunch when I take my staff out for reviews My fav plate is the dbbl cheeseburger plate jalapeno poppers and ddbl Lobster roll 11 00 Holy Crustaceans Batman The staff is great Bartenders are friendly and townie beers aahhhh what a selection If you are ever in Harvard Square it is a must that you sop in and get eatin 
-GQu-4Yxnzf17lRRSFBj3Q Harvard So thoroughly mediocre Like nothing I had had any real flavor The hot sauce tasted like heat Thats it No pepper taste no tomato taste it tasted like really watery leftover liquid from salsa with heat added The chipotle mushroom burrito was meh I ate it because I was hungry not because it was good I won t venture back to this MexiCali I d rather go back to Philly where there is a little tiny hole in the wall also called MexiCali that actually serves good food that tastes like something 
-GrbnVs0SB-bhyg4Aa4qqw Harvard I want to like Chipotle hell I like anything that competes with Anna s Taqueria however I cannot in good conscious recommended this place when Border Cafe is less than 100 feet away The menu is incredibly simple Start with the filling beef chicken steak etc Then choose your style burrito hard taco soft taco salad as well as the nonsensical burrito bowl and fajita burrito Fajita burrito Meat rice peppers onion guacamole sour cream cheese if I was at the meeting where they were trying to figure out what to call this contraption I would have suggested a Burrito with no beans Granted I m a dumb consumer I mean it MIT and Harvard aside when it comes to people trying to sell me things I fall for all the tricks Magic Bullet chop o matic yeah I have one Sham wow yeah I have two I would even buy a snuggie the blanket with arm holes if some dude came up to me and had it However I am smart enough to know know that if I don t like beans in my burrito I can order it without them That aside the food just isn t that great Also not that you should care but the inside is all light wood and steel copper giving it an modern industrial look Bottom line Someone out there likes lime rice Just walk the two blocks to Border Cafe If you are too tired I am sure some passerby would be glad to carry you if it meant striking back at Chipotle 
-Gtc7YcG0eqmwnoGbKYgtg Harvard Eh This place is just fine Pretty standard and traditional American food Nothing exciting but definitely eatable Do not come here expecting a fantastic meal There is one huge plus to daedalus the rooftop deck On a spring afternoon or summer evening this place is perfect The wood is beautiful and life feels serene sitting atop Cambridge Come for drinks great mojito 
-GuFea9jqrUb8vBT8CvPUw Harvard Well I guess there is a reason that you go to diners for breakfast and not dinner We live near there and decided to try Zoe s non eggs menu I ordered a greek salad with chicken 10 Pretty much all iceberg lettuce only a few pieces of chicken and a pile of feta cheese I could make a better one myself The service was good though mainly because no one goes there for dinner but I wouldn t go back for dinner ever 
-gwLPBl5L51DjL6V4kPlmg Harvard Although most people go to Sabra Grill for the falafel hummus spanakopita and other Lebanese Mediterranean standards I most frequently go for their delicious lentil soup It s hearty and filling strewn with diced potatoes chopped kale and suffused with a delicate lemon flavor And it s very reasonably priced It s not easy to find good soup in Harvard Square but I can always count on Sabra for deliciously satisfying soup Their falafel is good too 
-gXpiLNaaeNh-X6uN9jxlQ Harvard We stumbled upon this place for lunch since we had an hour or so before our tour of Harvard started and I m glad we did My husband loved the beer and had a huge burger free range organic yummy beef cooked to order I had the steak sliders with roasted peppers and blue cheese which was great We had Boston Creme Pie for dessert because we were in Boston The service was fast and friendly 
-GYDEsOMC2sXm4eS-kXu1g Harvard Nothing really caps off a day with friends more than a devastatingly sad movie We made the trip over to see The Diving Bell and the Butterfly I had heard various things about it not much about the plot but just that it was very moving and well done In addition to that it turned out to have a wonderful soundtrack and I had a single tear rolling down my cheek ______ Needless to say the theater was clean and was playing a number of movies I ve been looking forward to seeing I m hoping to make it back for The Savages before it moves Something like 9 25 a ticket and thankfully we had a friend who purchased our tickets for us while we were on the way because the theater was PACKED so basically we were left with our necks craned towards the heavens to watch the movie in the 3rd row back Grumble Grumble Why do they even POSITION seats this close to the screen is beyond me Damon s note that the place smelt of burnt popcorn was right on target but luckily for them I don t mind the smell What I did however mind was how filthy the bathrooms were upstairs Wet toilet paper on the floor Yucko 
-GyVi7zwn8rF3YGHnENK8A Harvard While my personal favorite Bageleria is Finagle a Bagel this one is a close second At Alpine Bagel they ve got fresh bagels everyday and their very own brick oven They make a mean pepperoni pizza Also to add to the zest they ve go a Freshens smoothie place right in their store Alpine Bagel is also located in the MIT student center Great food great prices just watch out for the crowds 
-gZe6GTkp4ZGmp8NfoFyhg Harvard very little behind the counter at flour excites me any more the 3 treats rarely showcase more than average baking skill the 8 sandwiches will hardly satiate my lunchtime hunger and the ancillary offerings like coffee and soup are ordinary more specifically the oreos are easily made at home the ginger peach muffin is not gingery enough the sandwich bread has no character and dear god the ordering then prepping efficiency lacks dearly needed efficiency i instead go for the quiche or stuffed bread where some creativity and seasonality are on display alongside bitter greens and live in a fair 6 neighborhood 
-gzW3ZSlZIp2WWac4jIYRQ Harvard After having been here a couple times I still can t say there s something special about it nor is there something wrong with it It s got something for everyone and especially good seafood offerings for an Irish pub My crabcake sandwich had bits of shell in it though The shepherd s pie is also ok and one of the cheaper entrees that will fill you up The burger offerings are also generous and interesting based on the descriptions I ll try them next time for sure The desserts can be ordered in half portions at reduced price which is incredibly considerate In general it s a great place to go to if you re lacking inspiration It s got a wonderful atmosphere and great drinks selection It s also good for large groups something that not many restaurants in the area can probably accommodate Don t expect a culinary tour de force from Asgard but do expect decent pub American classics 
-g_fyOnklCXYrQBFk-Fncw Harvard Our going away celebration for labmates VS My dinner of an apple crisp AND a Brownie Sunday My dessert of grilled meatloaf My postdessert dessert of bread pudding Several pitchers of stouts ales and porters Who wins The bread pudding by a sweet caramelly landslide My dinner of dessert items apple crisp wasn t very spicy or apply brownies were rock hard and dense made eating a chore Meatloaf grilled Isn t that just a flat square hamburger I don t want grill marks on my meatloaf Unfortunately I also expect soft crumbly texture for meatloaf not the chewy consistency here Bread pudding only outstanding thing pillowy soft topped with a wonderful caramel sauce nice to have on a chilly night get this instead of any other dessert on their menu Appetizers pretty typical fare nothing outstanding buffalo wings needed to be kicked up a notch in spiciness Overall if you need to entertain a large group of friends or coworkers in Harvard Square here s a decent place to go for some pitchers of beer 
-G_n1suUXCraQAojgWxhmQ Harvard What can I say I LOVE this place Very cheap and very delicious and I feel like home The Sunday brunch is the best value and best quality they even have real huge things of maple syrup in each table and organic ketchup try the toffu scarmble trust me Great original pizzas and entrees and now they even serve wine and beer really cheap and great The staff is the friendliest also I will keep coming to this place for as long as I m around D 
-h8Gwym_KRsjwQsXuj-TKA Harvard I was here for a business lunch the other day and found the staff and service to be very attentive The food was excellent and my overall experience was a positive one I have also been here during the summer for bar service and while the place does get quite crowded it is not a bad place to pre game with their knowledgeable bartenders making great suggestions again as the crowd picks up the personalized attention understandably goes away 
-HClzgw11peSjvp5VOVIDg Harvard Bottom line Great service great food decent prices great atmosphere High quality of food and service One of my top 3 favorite places in Boston and Cambridge also like Silvertone for comfort food and Grill 23 for steak I recommend the sunny room that faces the square for best seating Food soup was great burger was great and sandwiches all really good I prefer lunch here over dinner because of the lower priced lunch menu and beautiful sunny room Upstairs on the Square bucks my hypothesis of only eating out at comfort food places in Boston Frankly I can cook better at home than most fine dining in Boston not true for NYC or San Francisco so the only reason to go out to eat is for comfort food that is inexpensive and has decent service 
-HcT8STbInEpTeMTvgimkQ Harvard After Dr Phillips left Central Square Eye Care I naturally followed him up one square to Brattle I mentioned in a review for his old place that I have baaad eyes And they re only getting worse with age Anyway I m on VSP which doesn t cover much for me but Dr Phillips and his staff have always been really great about helping me sort out my payments contacts glasses even helping me find cheaper and better fitting contact lenses The best thing ever though When I randomly misplaced my glasses my 500 Gucci frames why vanity why and was sightless They offered me a whole wall of frames to pick out cheap as free and I just had to pay for my lenses Nice Of course I found the other frames a week later but the cheap as free ones are actually cuter There s a very sweet girl there whose also usually working up front When I placed a funky sounding order for contacts my left are supposed to last longer but I needed more as my allergies have been destroying them she called back to double check that I was getting what I wanted That s service 
-Hdj-agpxP0Usx5gikQzcQ Harvard A lot of the other reviews talk about not enough salt etc I am in the school of thought that fresh beautiful seafood should be done with very little alterations The seafood here was incredibly fresh and delicious My parents ordered the crab cakes and stuffed crab mushrooms and I was impressed Each had a yummy dipping sauce We ordered different fish each and I thought all of them was cooked perfectly The price is very inexpensive Great service 
-HfXVChWIwidrQLrUkR7gA Harvard I was ready to LOVE this place We went for my mom s birthday brunch The plus is that it is handicap accessible so my 91 year old granddad could come The minus BIG minus was that the room we were seated in was infested with flies The flies landed on everything the bread the plates the utensils faces hands hair it was really really gross And we weren t the only ones bothered by this the flies were all over the only ones who didn t seem to notice were the staff The service was appallingly slow We couldn t get a drinks list and then when we finally did it was a different waiter who took the drinks order Eventually our waiter came round to take the food order Then the food finally came out but then our waiter never came over to check on us even though by that stage we were all ready for another drink When we found another waiter to bring us coffee our waiter finally came rushing over and was annoyed that we bothered someone else for coffee By then we were all practically finished with our meals anyway And we are not fast eaters we actually like to sit and savor the food and the company Not only that but he then barely filled the coffee cups In my unofficial opinion on breakfast being chintzy about coffee is a bad sign We passed on dessert because we sort of wanted to get out of there while it was still daylight When we finally got the check the waiter gave us the wrong check Ugh what a mess but we still tipped 20 hopefully the tips are pooled I really can t get past the awful service And the flies Blech Swatting them away was not my idea of a fun brunch The food was really good even if my eggs were somewhat undercooked But they were farm fresh eggs and very very good But I am not likely to go back for brunch Nor am I likely to refer anyone to the brunch Not at those prices with that service And those darn flies 
-HHKXGcbC3OQ0oXfFDkdHA Harvard I remember my grandmother walking us down here for lunch on many occasions The Rice and Beans are so good Being Italian I really have no idea what I m ordering or what it s called but the fried pork thingies and the potatoes with the meet inside were awesome The portions are large and everyone is very nice They seem to go on vacation for weeks at a time but when they are there its awesome 
-hi5Swn_FAutLbQgM0PCjg Harvard I don t think I ve ever had anything I disliked or even did not like at Flour Their sandwiches are great not superhuman gigantic like Dave s but with just as much flavour and creativity Their ingredients taste fresh and the breads are nice and chewy with lots of flavour The tartine specials aren t bad as well as they are smaller and open faced providing a smaller bread to filling ratio I also like how they have a half sandwich option for those of us who prefer to retain mobility after lunch or to save room for dessert And dessert is where Flour excels I ve never had a bad dessert experience here There are of course the famous sticky buns but also other options that I feel deserve just as much renown The apple snacking cake is a great option super moist full of small apple chunks and very nicely spiced The trifle is great as well prefect if you want a big moist gooey dessert that s not TOO sweet There are some items I feel can be improved upon including the chocolate banana pudding tasted a bit grainy and the chocolate could have been stronger the Breton cake kougn amann too sweet could use a bit more moisture and the rosemary olive savoury cake needed more olive oil But overall a great bakery where you are bound to find something yummy 
-HJr0ZRrWZRmDEwOdeSarA Harvard Known for Scorpion Bowls and co eds A fun time AND a hang over in the morning Dancing upstairs bar scene downstairs 
-hJTC5DL_qgYuSaZZDu8Eg Harvard I just finished a Reuben Went Veggie sandwich from Beantowne Coffee House The atmosphere was nice and the staff quite friendly but the sandwich was by no stretch of the imagination a 7 sandwich The description indicated that there was avocado in the sandwich I m not sure why there was avocado in a Reuben In this case avocado did not mean slices of avocado but a sweet salt and vinegar dressing that may have been thickened and colored with avocados There was no avocado flavor at all Otherwise the sandwich was fairly mundane and probably worth almost 5 The marble rye was tasty as were the cabbage and tomatoes 
-hkW1hWLIZnM3WN-20p0og Harvard I love this theatre yes it s a small accessible theatre serving beer wine and concessions Indie atmosphere is great the personnel very helpful a loyal sponsoring following and they host film festivals double features documentaries indie first runs with Q A s and other events through the year They Bring in the film Artists and directors and also host other events from time to time Their website calendar is indispensable Located near restaurants and 24 hr market 
-HlOJVcqSw5_tv2QKoAaSw Harvard This review is going to be on the restaurant part of the place While I ve been to a few shows here which were all great I want to focus on the food Overall this place serves very good Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food Grape leaves are the best from a restaurant I ve ever had The only better tasting ones I ve had were from the kitchen of my friend s Turkish grandmother All other dishes I ve had here were always great and based on my friend with the Turkish grandmother authentic tasting Service has always been pleasant and attentive Prices are reasonable Ask for a table by the front so you can people watch on Mass Ave 
-hMsvV0oy5foyoj6oDurcw Harvard Okay so normally I would absolutely HATE a place like this I hate the kind of clientle that goes here If you have read my previous reviews I normally look way down upon these types of establishments But I ll be god damned if they don t know how to treat a bunch of assholes who s main goal is to get as fucked up as possible Lemme tell you a little story We were having a send off party for one of my friends who was moving out to Japan to work doing the so called Harvard Gauntlet which consists of touring every Harvard Square bar doing shots We did the one in the place in the Cambridge Hotel did OM 50 bucks at the time OUCH Redline eh did a few others and somehow ended up at Casablanca s We go to Casablanca which is a mistake in itself but we go What do you have to drink and they say We don t do shots so we go Do you have any Long Island Iced Teas or something heavy And while we were being not so classy he had the nerve of going Yeah why don t you guys go to the Hong Kong that s more of your kind of place with this utter arrogance So we did and met up with the bouncer manager dude We told him of our plight and he goes Yeah I fired that kid come to our place and we re gonna take care of you Taking care of us meant that he gave our party of five people half full glasses about 3 shots worth of Yager for FREE That my friends is what sticks in my mind and I will remember for a long time We tipped heavily I banged my forehead on the corner of the table and somehow we stumbled out after four scorpion bowls the Yager and a few beers I didn t feel awkward I didn t feel weird Just good times I went home hammered with a bleeding forehead and nothing but happy thoughts as my best friend s girlfriend puked all over Mass Ave Not somewhere I m going to bring a date but if I wanna finish the Harvard Gauntlet this is where I m going to go 
-hn6ICSp9XDPOeXtYApcMw Harvard Came here for brunch and while there was a 40 minute wait it was so worth it Their amazing bloody marys helped keep me company as my friends waited to be seated Once seated we were treated to a slightly wacky ambiance and served by hipsters I ordered the incredibly delicious smoked salmon benedict and a side of sweet potato fries to die for This is a real gem 
-hoLcJ-xkrJ6uDf4T07TGw Harvard I can tell I m not a foodie and not a fine dining aficionado something you may want to consider reading my review of a restaurant because when I come across a really great dining experience that is good food good presentation good service all in one package it really stands out against the backdrop of work a day adequacy I m apparently accustomed to Blue Room for dinner this Sunday was far and away the best dining I ve had in a while Tomato salad was delicious and beautifully presented The crispy chicken pav was a respectable chunk of breast meat that was just like it promised crispy on the outside but tender and juicy inside and accompanied with potatoes mushrooms and a delicious sauce And the nectarine upside down cake was the perfect finish As if that wasn t enough and it would have been frankly barring simple assault the staff were the perfect blend of attentive without being overly solicitous helpful with suggestions and clarifications for the dietary constraints in our party and at one point genuinely funny Which one of you had the chicken we both did GET IT Ample space they got steadily busier as our stay wound down but that didn t impact the level of service and not too noisy Though I feel compelled to point out the room is not actually blue so if you re a stickler for those sorts of details well then you ve got bigger problems than where to eat in Kendall Square let s be honest Ah and as was pointed out to me afterwards by a friend Blue Room has been doing locavore since before it was the it thing it seems not a huge consideration for me personally but always nice if it comes along with the great food So the next time you and your comrades find yourself stumbling out into the early evening after a Landmark Theatre experience please consider deconstructing the film over dinner at the Blue Room 
-HOlMHgQMJ73ttdTaQCTbw Harvard I went here for Restaurant Week The food was very tasty another vote for the duck the service was good the atmosphere was good It s not the most unusual venue but everything was very competent A great date spot in the middle of Harvard Square 
-HOs9IfbrTzYenTDTMXbkg Harvard Let me start by saying I love the Miracle of Science Tory Row is in a good spot convenient for my waiting for the Lady to finish her yoga class times and the occasional Harvard Square afternoon beer Honestly the food is only OK but this is just a decent spot to get a drink 
-hoskDxqGbdIqAuTk9_7-g Harvard My first experience with B M was 4 years ago when I was a makeup novice I miss Beauty and Main Now that I have moved to NY I am left with a couple of zillion Sephoras and Department Stores to find my favorite makeup brands I have an odd color too my skin dark oliveish a little on the pink side and could never quite find a color that matched me especially for concealer I stopped in here and they were really helpful I explained that I don t want to look like a drag queen when I have on makeup and they took that suggestion to heart I left with a Laura Mercier concealer a Nars blush and brushes to complete the look I didn t feel pressured to buy but ultimately couldn t wait to I had products that suited my skin type tone and personality 4 years later I constantly get compliments on how natural my makeup looks I would highly recommend this store to makeup novices like I was when I first took the plunge here 
-HpNMFXSJ_o3jGM2vc_NfA Harvard Just your neighborhood sweet sweet cupcakery Really cute look Really nice workers Really pretty cupcakes Really normal prices And by normal think 4 a pop But cupcakes are seriously so hit or miss Some of these are moist Some aren t The flavors could be good or not Just a place to stop by and grab something for a little birthday or hospitality gift I was torn about the aok v meh i ve experienced better bc honestly it s only aok and i can t say i ve experienced better b c in my experience cupcakeries are the worst Anyway it s a 2 i ve experienced better from scratch 
-Hr-15dGvrY4Z2FbrdG9-w Harvard Not a bad place lots of pretty people here and oftentimes decent techno The drink is a little dear the food is small and looks like appetizers from Trader Joe s and the service ain t great usually too many people and not enough waitstaff But they have Franziskaner beer on draft a really good German wheat beer BUT the lines to get in It s not worth the wait I ve seen huge lines even when it s 10F out not worth the wait for me But maybe I m just an auld fart Watch out for the rolling benches they tip over if you get up too fast 
-hr1r6u3cqBQluGKLXjrdw Harvard It took me an hour and a half to get my food delivered to my apartment I used the Foodler website to place my delivery order and the projected delivery time said my food would arrive in 45 minutes which was fine with me When it was 15 minutes past when my food was supposed to arrive I called the restaurant to check on the status of my order and was told it was on the way Another 15 minutes later still no food had appeared so I called the restaurant again and was told that they hadn t received my order The employee was very unhelpful and for some reason was unwilling to call their delivery guy to see where he was at I ended up getting my food 45 minutes later than promised The food itself was good enough but the poor quality of customer service I received was inexcusable 
-HrWZxlHMtu03gd0CjpkpQ Harvard Went for drinks on a late Monday afternoon sat at the bar About 100 beers on tap all served in the perfect glass Server was helpful and cheerful knew her beers and steered me toward a fantastic IPA after letting me try a couple samples My friend loved the gazpacho which was pureed and topped with a drizzle of olive oil and some decorative purple flowers Also ordered the charcuterie plate which had among other things a house made pate that must be the love child of bacon and fois gras Served with crispy buttery toast points Yum Went back another night for an excellent burger and fries at the bar Different waiter equally excellent service Thumbs up 
-hrZ0Rd-6o2V1tNcR80gAg Harvard I went to this tattoo shop after strong refusal by two of my friends one of whom gotten a tattoo there and was quite unsatisfied My experience however was slightly better The staff was professional and I had the only girl artist there do my tattoo Ellen M Kudos to her because she was super cool and nice about everything She talked everything she would do over with me and explained her reasoning on her decisions for my tattoo Anyways when all s said and done I walked out with a gorgeous bright colorful tattoo of a fish I drew up She was lighthanded and pretty quick but very careful in her work I respect that It was my third tattoo and a good experience My only complaints a couple snooty artists I don t respect that shit Please don t run a business then act like a fucking snob to potential customers I ve worked in customer service and that s fucking stupid of you You will get no business that way and plus word will get around ON YELP So whoever this cocky son of a bitch guy was go take your masshole attitude somewhere else or shove it up your dirty ass Though my receptionist was decent No complaints there Plenty kind What a bloody damn relief Whew So if you want a decent tattoo you can come here I m just not sure I completely recommend it for everyone Hopefully you wind up with Helen or a nice artist and not Captain Jackass 
-HT25ISVyBILVyo02DE9TA Harvard I bought about 95 of my daughter s clothes here when she was first born I couldn t help it its cup runneth over with the gorgeous baby lulu the boutique oilily the massively practical gap jammies and the simply sweet handknit cardigans by someone s gramma auntie Once she outgrew them a month later I would return the clothes to the store in pretty much the exact same condition I found them in It s the ultimate green clothing store 
-HVscW7Z-T3loB0VG1GRRg Harvard There s a vibe here that s sort of Seat yourself we ll be there in a minute and I don t say that in a negative way It s an unfussy and welcome relief from the scenester coffee shops you can easily find in the area They have excellent hummus that alone is worth a visit The best thing about Algiers however is the upstairs deck You might as well be in a treehouse with some tea or a glass of wine you can be outside enjoying a lovely summer evening in Harvard Square but without you know sitting outside on a Harvard sidewalk The only drawback to this is if you are sensitive to hookah smoke as it sometimes wafts up from the downstairs tables They ve got some awesome looking old school espresso and coffee machines near the registers You should also look up immediately upon stepping in the front door and check out the mirrored details on the architecture Bring a book bring a good friend bring a desire to relax and enjoy some deliciousness 
-hWdiSEFlHT9Ex8j3bs6Jw Harvard I was satisfied with the bulk section not the best I ve seen but it s hard to compete with Oregon Still not all coops have bulk vinegar and olive oil so props to them The spices and flour are great too However the organic produce section is abysmal Maybe this is just a misconception of coops but I expect organic food to make up all if not the majority of options but here you need to be careful I m all for local but when it comes to putting something in my body I want to be sure it hasn t been coated with nasty chemicals first and Harvest makes this task just a bit harder I think they need to hold themselves to higher standards Best option in Boston is to do a CSA for your produce and buy the rest at the co op 
-HWwJ3_qgmbi5C9MvKrS9w Harvard What can I say Had I not been to several other shabu shabu style restaurants and also serve this style of food regular to my own family I may not have realized what a bad jobs Shabu Ya does When my wife and I decided to try Shabu Ya we did not have the time to trek on over to Chinatown Instead we opted to have dinner here We ordered the house broth black angus beef a modified sea food platter only shrimp and fish cakes and the tofu plate Our water delivered our drinks and setup the various containers used to mix up dipping sauce For two dinners one small tray containing four small 1 cubed dishes had smears of condiments which we could flavor our ponzu sauce with It was unfortunate that my wife and I had negotiate over who would have 4 slices of scallions rather than 5 slices of scallions in our dipping sauce The broth came and looked a kin to dish water and had about as much flavor as an unreduced weak asian influenced stock Along with the broth our water eventually delivered two sides of vegetables with noodles At this point in our meal we immediately realized the difference in portions and quality of food Our vegetable platters contained a single piece of a nappa cabbage leaf one inch of corn one mushroom one slice of carrot one broccoli floret a sparse stock of water cress and a piece of tofu Had we combined our two vegetable plates we would have had less on one plate than we have ever experienced at other shabu shabu style restaurants After ten minutes had passed and my wife and I had cooked and eaten the majority of our vegetables our waiter finally surfaced with our protein as he described it Our beef plate was rather average in quantity of product It was very tasty albit sliced at times too thin leaving us to scrape shreds of beef off the serving platter The seafood platter left us wanting more The seafood platter contained four prawns and four slices of two different types of fish cakes A frozen single serving dofu plate at a local asian market contained twice the amount of sea food cakes for significantly less The tofu platter was OK however some additional variety would have been nice Next time I would just cut up my own tofu and stay home The decor of Shabu Ya was not to my liking Their design is very modern with crisp lines and high contrast colors Our small round table left very little room for the food and drinks It felt as if we were sitting in the laps of other dinners being so close to them Due to the open floor plan you really notice how often the staff are running around and acting uncoordinated We interacted with four or five different people on the restaurant floor through the evening For people with more than five in their dinning party consider calling ahead as we saw numerous parties of 6 crammed into a booth designed for 4 people I think the people responsible for the restaurant concept forget that shabu shabu is a comfort food which should be served in an atmosphere that is comfortable both in space on the table and between dinning parties 
-HZknny6zG-5yztXp0ZGUA Harvard Just ok I d go there for lunch only because is close to harvard square 
-HZu5_zgPSsTsGBm-e6oUw Harvard Kind of difficult to find and there aren t really signs pointing you in the right direction It was pretty hot inside the building and I probably would have stayed longer if it wasn t so stifling The glass flower exhibit was much more scientific then I expected and the area of the museum is fairly small But that s what I get for being used to the AMNH in New York 
-i0SmF469pJS_56NfRZW9A Harvard I am sad not to write a better review because this place seems legit I will try it again and let you know if I have a better experience next time However I felt that the burrito I ordered was bland It needed and extra kick I am not talking cheese yes I realize good Mexican food does not have to mean lots of cheese which I did appreciate here but their hot sauce was a major let down I need some spice on my carnitas burrito and Boca Grande let me down 
-i2S5baCasOxm7erFXYV3g Harvard Border Cafe es muy muy muy bien Everything I ve had I ve loved including a gigantic strawberry margarita You get unlimited free chips and salsa while you wait What s not to love Except for the fact that you may overindulge and be too full for your delicious meal I am a victim Even that s ok though becuase I really love leftovers Plus the prices are amazing A large tasty inexpensive meal Man I m getting hungry My one word of advice Harvard Square eateries and bars can get pretty crowded on the weekends and Border is no exception I ve been told an hour and a half wait on a Saturday night and they don t have anywhere for you to sit while you wait While the food is amazing it s definitely more worth your time to try stop in for lunch or on a week night instead 
-i3mGR8VKmarlvNLKhW8Cw Harvard I don t eat much meat so I haven t tried it here The veggie plate was pretty satisfying and comes with pita and tahini sauce if you get a couple pieces of falafel I love that you can also get a side of fruit The falafel is tasty and a bit tangy not super dry Beware of the babaganoush It s gelatinous and smoky The prices are on par for the area and the large veggie plate lasts me two meals 
-i7mrBe85lUNfCcqpppYew Harvard Le s is good The service is very quick and one can have a hearty sit down lunch in half hour The broth of the pho is very flavorful no cheating here you can tell the stuff simmered for a long long time They also serve various rice and noodle dishes but I usually stick to Pho 
-ICo1QP9Kohci_T5yAP_zw Harvard Alas I went here for lunch today full of high expectations of tastiness after reading all these wonderful reviews and other recommendations Indeed the Eggs Florentine were really awesome and the melange that composes their homefries mushrooms broccoli whoa is awesome except for the one unexpected ingredient A HAIR My dish was whisked away and a replacement was offered and accepted but now I am wary 
-idqNhTNB_dE96v7thzH2g Harvard I don t get all the hype on this place I ve been here several times for brunch and have left disappointed unsatisfied each time Also way overpriced for what it is Why anyone would go here over The Friendly Toast next door is beyond me I ve long since crossed this place off my list 
-IglYYFwRThoGW35JPNGJw Harvard I am taking Spanish and Grant Writing right now and both classes are excellent The teachers really know their stuff and the staff at CCAE are incredibly friendly and helpful The classes are so cheap this is an excellent value If you ve been thinking about brushing up on whatever language you took in high school go here it s a quarter of the price of other area language schools and personally I know I ve learned more than my friends who went to one of them I m definitely going to keep up with Spanish and take some cooking classes to boot 
-iI0i_-fqj9sia8JCjwjpg Harvard It was what it was I would return knowing what I could expect Service was professional food was predictable The Caesar salad was dressed while the lettuce was wet and overdressed and so the flavors were completely diluted or again it was overdressed and the dressing has no flavor but the deviled eggs passed muster without being thrilling a burger was decent though the fries need work blanch them first please In word middle of the road somewhat upscale beer wine and burger place that does a little extra 
-ILFxU_2PAi7KGOgSKf3yA Harvard I really love working here except the internet is so weird here I ll connect to it via wifi and then all of a sudden it ll cut out like every 30 minutes or so And I d have to reset the wifi on my mac to be able to get on it again Kind of inconvenient for a library First world problems I guess But other than that this place is beautiful I love how there are different areas to work in which have been thoughtfully been sectioned out based on your work style Want to eat and study and don t mind too much noise Stay on the first floor Want to work outside or feel like you re working outside Grab a seat in the hallway that connects the lobby to the children s section Want SERIOUS quietness and don t mind about not eating food or even drinking your water Go upstairs in the research section Want to just read and not deal with kids and their technologies There are specific rooms on the second floor devoted to you folk that don t like to be around technology The only other annoying things about this place besides the intermittent wifi is the amount of kids that come in to hang out after school It s because the public school is right next door Also the library isn t open that late for college kids who want to work late but then that s when you move to a Starbucks or the Harvard Law Library 
-ILGXVP3nMaJfgJ6i0V7_A Harvard I used to have a friend that worked here I went to pick her up after work and she had the staff after hours model for me things that she wanted to know would this look good on me I dunno if they would have looked good on her but they looked great on the staff If If i could give it 100stars I would Talk about an incredibly useless review don t try and replicate my situation they will probably have you thrown in jail More to the review point I ve bought a few things here and the sales people really did have some great ideas and were very helpful in finding me a gift for uhh my girlfriend 
-iLMu1_Sljfc4TDY5vdhxQ Harvard Got to the store today around 4 55 was greeted by a sales person and started looking for glasses two minutes later the lights were turned off and another sales person told me they were closed and I had to leave Just a horrible experience Apparently they close at 5 on Saturdays I never heard or experienced anything like this before being kicked out of a store I was ready to purchase my glasses Horrible and wouldn t recommend it 
-IooZ_UmGQ8Sqdt0HS0WwQ Harvard I never really feel like I m going into battle when I come here with a lot of people I ve had spontaneous cast parties here and last time I was here with 6 people from work Even though we got a smaller table than desired we were never really considered a burden which sometimes happen when you roll up to a place with more than 4 people I think John Harvard s is always good for groups minus Monday night trivia heh The food is definitely hit or miss Sometimes they try and go over the top with sandwiches by making them HUGE Salads are great but get the dressing on the side to avoid soggy leaves and an overdose of creaminess I m not crazy about the regular beers but sometimes I ll get one of their features And they have growlers for those interested in taking home their favorite beer from this brew house Like I kind of mentioned up top the service is really great Most if not all the waiters I ve had have been pretty entertaining and definitely chill I just wish the food was just as consistent 
-IskG6iaBTEEFR2ZJNxHzQ Harvard Hidden Sweets is one of those stores that s all about convenience Need Harvard or Boston soulvineers Boston sports team shirts Wrapping paper cards magnets balloons or CANDY This is your place I come here for their bin candy selection which is the best I ve seen in Boston All the candy is priced the same so there s no worrying about separate bags or mixing candy that s not suppose to be together The candy is always fresh and the bins and scoopers are always clean The candy is 11 95 a pound which I find expensive but the convenience and selection is worth it especially if you re not buying much What I really appreciated my last visit was the customer service The man behind the counter gave me a free clear bag for free all the default bags are colorful and have Hidden Sweets written on them He even tied the bag with colorful ribbon for free and asked if he could do so while I browsed the rest of the store so I wouldn t have to wait when I checked out They also have at least ten different kinds of candy cigarettes and tons of foreign candy Pretty awesome 
-isyh-P9FzMxH6jFvrn1eA Harvard Hi Everybody I wanted to tell you about OM from two perspectives I had a great meal there individually AND then since I had to plan a dinner for conference attendees for work I decided to try OM for our group It was amazing Everyone loved it The food was superb and the servers were just as gracious and charming and attentive and pleasant and sweet as you could possibly imagine I have only had really great friendly experiences here I want to recommend it to anyone who wants a lovely meal in a great setting and I want to recommend it to any of you corporate types who want to hold group dinners or functions here My group has held our event dinners all over harvard square and this was by far the most popular with guest and staff alike Try it you will love it Cheers everybody Amanda 
-iUdunaqmbyPOQolBfLI1w Harvard Well this would have been a solid 3 star review until we saw a mouse In the restaurant We were there on Friday Aug 28 and at about 10pm when we were getting ready to leave we all saw a mouse scurry across the back wall of the main dining room The waitress saw the mouse as well and was not at all disturbed which to us WAS disturbing I know that Boston buildings have mouse problems But I don t think it s unreasonable to expect eating establishments to deal with those issues It s one thing to have a mouse in your apartment it s another to have a mouse in an area where you are making food for many many people As for the food it was pretty solidly a 3 star experience Worrying about leptospirosis has downgraded our rating 
-iuo9PLP0jJeZlgHK7ov6A Harvard I know everyone says they are pricey but compared to some of the other bead shops I ve hit lately Beadworks seems practically discount in price if we ignore Michaels or AC Moore Tons of beads a huge selection some awesome stuff some mediocre stuff but a very helpful staff My only complaint is that they do not offer a course in a wireworking technique I want to try I m hoping to see if I can have a private lesson instead 
-iV0_f37Qqc0qo6MGVqlKg Harvard I am a fan of Cambridge 1 I used to eat here frequently when I was going to school in Cambridge They have very good thin crust pizza with lots of toppings The pizza itself is not greasy and is actually very healthy I especially like the crsipy crust around the edge of the pie I also like the Iceberg Lettece Wedge this dish may not be for everyone but I like it because it is simple and refreshing The price is relatively inexpensive and the ambience is trendy I ve been to many different pizza joints and Cambridge 1 is one of my favorites 
-Iwr5z3fNa2WqeTvRUK2ow Harvard It s been called to my attention that I did not write in my review that we tried to get anyone s attention but I will mention that we did indeed try to flag someone down We attempted many times to verbally get someone s attention as well as physically hand waving etc So having been ignored we left It has also been mentioned to me that it is a seat yourself place a sign might be nice to place you know somewhere Since there is no sign it would have been helpful for someone anyone to have said Hey it s seat yourself so wherever you can find a place It literally would have taken 5 seconds to do so Since it was incredibly busy and we were a relatively large group it s a small bar the tables aren t huge we would have left but definitely would have come back to try again on another day 
-ixYcmm4bLmqZek8XvakEA Harvard I hadn t been to Casablanca in years but recently purchased a Buy With Me discount deal Went for a date night We arrived earlier than our reservation and our table was ready That was a big plus The wait staff was friendly and attentive and of course you have to love the decor I did find it a little weird though that their was no music playing in the dining area This was at about 6 30 at night on a Saturday night I ordered the Sangria and my date had a beer The Sangria was very good We didn t order appetizers as the bread basket and olive oil was sufficient but other tables had apps that looked very good For our main course we had the Pork Chop with Ricotta Dumplings in a balsamic reduction and the Quail on Turnip Mash The Pork Chop was decent nothing to write home about The Turnip Mash however was out of this world I could just eat that All and all the food was excellent but not mind blowing I really should give Casablanca 4 stars as it is very deserving but in comparison to its neighboring restaurants like the Harvest it does not shadow its competitors But definitely good for a date night to impress 
-IzEXa0lK-OkVLDqROiA7Q Harvard I really think that if you live in or around Boston you have to hit up Miracle of Science at least once I freaking adore the enormous Periodic Table menu they have conveniently located on a chalkboard wall The atmosphere is really casual the service is good the crowd is laid back the drink selection and price is reasonable and the food is solid There s no reason to NOT eat here at least once 
-J-wPhjOu8PVFW6YAciJXQ Harvard There Will Be Flood Feb 2012 So let me start off by saying that the execution by the actors in this show was really good They were clearly well rehearsed and one could tell that they put in a lot of work learning the songs and dances The same can be said about the set props and costumes Unfortunately despite how good these elements of the show were the content of the show itself was terrible it just wasn t funny Most jokes relied on bad puns such as if you show me your skin I ll show you my bone or Eve was made from a baby back rib Finally it should be mentioned that over 1 4 of the audience left after the first intermission 
-J8LN7nFShUIv3poNrLP0Q Harvard In Annie s House we are always in a battle between Cinderella s or Chicago Pizza when it comes down to pizza delivery or so we thought One few days ago in a little house in East Cambridge we researched high and low for a pizza place that would deliver a fresh mozzarella tomato pie a plain mushroom pie two gingerale s and something very artery clogging for the hungover patient oh and maybe a greek salad too FatS O S Every place had this or that but never the whole combo we were looking for so how great was it when we came across Beauty s a place we ve both eyed many times They had everything the ordering process over phone was smooth and plus they came in lightning speed The still warm and bubbled crust Margherita Francesca even came with a little container with basil Awwwwww how unpredictable The Americana style mushroom pizza was thin and perfect packaged in an almost stylish as far as pizza boxes go cardboard with their personal stickers everywhere Everything was tasty Yummy cheese good quality garlic bread not some mince garlic and slab of butter italian roll Trust me order delivery from here if you are in Cambridge since Pinnochio s and best slice blah blah places would need a pickup What a beauty except the name of the place Beauty for pizza subs and salads and the font color used for the sign Sorry people but typo snob in me wouldn t let those details pass right on by without mention 
-jbLwAXFDmam7SFDD81IIA Harvard Meatball subs are deeelicious The bread is the best part 
-JdPkWfxUilb2AnRw_2Rbw Harvard In a world where everything seems in a continual state of upheaval it s nice to know that there are a few constants I spent most of my twenties drunk Okay I spent ALL of my twenties drunk I spent most of my twenties drunk at the Hong Kong This was in the 90 s You didn t go there to discuss Proust over wee glasses of port you didn t go there to meet your soulmate and you certainly didn t go there for the FOOD You went there to suck down Scorpion Bowls fish around drunkenly in the ice for the little plastic animals and then go upstairs and dance lewdly and inappropriately with people you wouldn t give the time of day to in your sober lucid hours This was the case in 93 and so it is today This place gets three stars for consistency and reliability in these mad mad times 
-JJEJ1z9EmeDhL6KGh-kHg Harvard Boston has several solid even great pizza joint but very few decent by the slice options Heat lamps warming slowly congealing stale cardboard spinning limply in their glass box is enough to put you off eating all together Which is why Pinocchio s is great the good pizza good location good price means new pies are coming out constantly and your chance of getting something fresh and hot are excellent One of the few places to eat a decent quick lunch on the cheap in Harvard Sq now if they d just bring back the breakfast places 
-jO62aBGXUs67NH7a0a7BQ Harvard Wow what a let down The menu looked amazing yet almost every dish successfully disappointed Service was good although it wasn t clear how familiar our waiter actually was with the menu When asked the difference between the maple beer and their house beer he said that one had a maple finish and the other didn t very helpful Their house beer with pig in the title tastes like a bad homebrew Definitely stick with familiars like the IPA We asked for his recommendation between two dishes pork chop and lamb and he said that he didn t really like either again between another set of choices he couldn t enthusiastically endorse one over the other I m all for honesty but this was a bit much The appetizer a salmon salami was great Really delicate and nice flavors A highlight of the meal The crab cakes were tasty although we both found pieces of shell all throughout them ick My entree the duck was overcooked think dry thanksgiving turkey I sent it back and explained that I would like it a bit more rare The returning dish was practically still quacking it was so raw Again it went back to the kitchen As they have an open kitchen I was able to see the chef line cooks arguing with our waiter about the done ness of things The third attempt was cooked appropriately and was nice Food came out quickly almost too fast in fact We barely had time to finish up our appetizers before they were whisked away and entrees were before us I appreciate prompt service but this was altogether rushed We asked to see the manager who came over and apologetically let us knew he d been informed of the duck situation We also let him know about the shells in the crabcakes He comped the duck and also brought us out a few nice cheeses for dessert I really appreciated the way that the mgmt dealt with things and attempted to make it all better All in Henrietta s was not what we had hoped for 
-jOmP6MUeirI9O_eM7bkDg Harvard I was lucky enough to get to go to the soft opening I d heard they were having I was prepared to cut them some slack since I figured they d need to get their routine down but no slack needed cutting They were totally on the ball The service was perfect and extremely friendly and the food was outstanding The place has a cool diner vibe but more airy and open You ve got a lot to choose from on the menu and I m pretty sure they serve breakfast all day Thank you They have a build your own burger with a ton of different topping options The hard thing is deciding What I really appreciate is the fact that they make most of their ingredients in house things such as their seitan their applesauce and their vegan mayonnaise It s not store bought stuff The desserts were even more incredible We got peach pie which I don t even want to think about because it just makes me want some right now It was made with fresh peaches and the crust was so light and flaky yet crispy ok must stop thinking about it until I can go there again And the vegan blueberry cheesecake unbelievable Why didn t I get any to take home why why why I will learn from this mistake Anyhow I can t wait to go back and try everything on their menu most of which can be made vegan we were told So psyched about this place 
-JSzGh8CDAvIcK63pCuOWw Harvard How did I walk by this for 20 years My new go to place for moderate to pricey house gifts I ll pay if it s hand made and or unique This store has some amazing buying going on Gorgeous housewares bowls unique utensils pottery mirrors candles bags scarves and yes jewelry The two ladies working were more than pleasant helpful and informative 
-Jt8F2A0XyQmGuPjuFpIDw Harvard I have a co worker who describes Characters as a the bastard child of a mall food court and an airport bar I personally find this description both adept and hilarious and as you walk into Characters oddly open Chilis in a hotel vibe you might too It s a dive without meaning to be and without being dirty The drinks are fine and the food is fine I had a quesadilla which was completely unoffensive for instance Their weekly Stump Trivia is actually pretty fun because amidst your desolate surroundings you can kick some butt and still brag that you did it a stone s throw away from the intellectual assets of MIT Don t go for dinner don t go on a date and don t go as a destination but dare I say it DO go for plenty of space with good humored friends who want to make their hour a bit happier or your trivia team that s been down on its luck Because mall bar airport food court adds enough character to at least make things interesting 
-jtBlcFKRtdHthURXB7P5w Harvard I can t believe it took me years after living in the area to start eating here I guess I thought it was just dessert and coffee However I d say this is THE place for sandwiches in Harvard Square I ve had their tea coffee hot chocolate quiche baked goods and their famous sweet potato sandwich Oh my God that sandwich As a regular carnivore it s pretty hard to get me to order a sandwich without meat on it But this sandwich is unbelievable Hard to get a seat sometimes because of all the people chilling and studying so I don t recommend coming with more than 2 3 people But I love the atmosphere Honestly love everything about this place I m going to make an effort to visit more often 
-Jtz241EOfDWCvdxR9HLjA Harvard good burger fun place but never seen a busier place same with their other two locations tried to come at 7 and couldnt get a table had to come back after 10 Tried to bring my fiancee here twice and cant get a table always an hour wait 
-JU1lrfaG2a9XdVQFwcz_Q Harvard I wish their were negative star levels on Yelp If I was reviewing this shop back in December when I first got my glasses from them I would have given them Five Stars except for the price tag but sadly my opinion has been changed Last week my glasses that I had taken wonderful care of just disconnected at the lens and nose bridge piece And for frames that cost nearly 350 530 including the lens six months is far too short of a lifespan So I took my frames back into Vision House hoping for a free repair and I was greeted by way too much sass I told the clerk what happened and showed him my frames he proceeded to grab them to inspect them He said I must have been lying about them just coming apart and insisted someone must have stepped on them He proceeded to insist there were also hairline cracks on the frame but failed to be able to show them to me He started to twist my frames trying to prove their durability but now at this point even if I wanted to get them welded somewhere else I couldn t The entire time I was talking to him he kept making rude comments and giving me attitude while snickering with a clerk working at the opposite counter When I started to write down the frame information and say that 350 is an awful lot for a pair of ray ban knock offs that broke so prematurely his attitude slightly changed and he offered to repair my glasses by charging me 100 for the replacement frame To me a price tag of over 600 is just too much to justify spending on a product and repair I felt gouged over When I told Mr Clerk that it seemed like the frames were likely 100 at cost and shouldn t have been marked up so much in the first place he informed me he was just giving them to me at that price so I would never come into the store and asked me if I was looking for a fight young lady While the frame display looks great from outside my opinion is to stay far away from this place 
-jvAnbWOb-epHncmtPOSTQ Harvard I wrote my previous review as a regular show goer at IB I m now a student there which has given me a different perspective ImprovBoston s comedy classes they offer Sketch and Stand up as well as Improv are really its heart and soul Most of the improv cast members teach and a good chunk of the audiences are always comprised of comedy students who incidentally get into all regular shows for free provided the show isn t sold out I go to shows often enough that taking classes actually saves me money Unlimited show access aside I ve gotten a lot out of the classes I ve taken stand up and improv so far It s a great way to meet people while sharpening your funny bone Even if you have no interest in performing it s a great time 
-jvlMV_f7eNdu8cWOjCRTw Harvard Awesome coffees They taste like hot silk I d love to stay around here all day and indulge in their drinks and pastries but the lack of wi fi is disappointing 
-JWP9CS2aK9r9l3uBWk-3A Harvard The walk home from work in Back Bay to Central Square will never be the same No longer will I approach starvation somewhere on Mass Ave bridge while contemplating smoots Sweet cupcakes has finally opened its doors on Mass ave And sweet they are The icing is rich and thick dolloped on top of a rather small piece of cake The icing isn t quite fudgey but it s not light And I mean that in a good way The cake was rich and mostly moist and rather tasty The cupcakes have a little piece of sugary candy on top as well They had several flavors of icing the day I was in including dark chocolate cappuccino vanilla They had a carrot cake cake flavor too It s a very good cupcake and they don t have much competition down there in Back Bay But and there s always a but they are expensive 3 25 for a cupcake Now I d pay that for an incredible tasting big cupcake that could make a meal hit Brown Betty s in Philadelphia for that But 3 25 for a something I could carry on a silver dollar I m not so sure it can be a regular stop for that kind of coin On the plus side they double dollop the icing kind of like two scoops of ice cream and it s very good icing but man I felt a little gouged The space has a very bright clean feel to it and there s a few tables in there to sit for the 45 seconds it takes to gobble the cupcake Service was very pleasant and efficient One nice touch the to go boxes have a little support thing inside so your 3 25 cupcake doesn t get squished or harmed in anyway Personally I d rather pay 2 00 and just shove the whole thing in mouth before I left the store I think it s great that we have a cupcake option in back bay but just expect to pay back bay prices 
-K-ek3HF1sq7Dy6upeK_bA Harvard I love a good diner menu and quirky places so The Friendly Toast is right up my alley I went on a weekday lunch and the restaurant was packed with people from the local business parks Cambridge Center MIT Labs etc I was on my own so I took a seat at the bar Menu is classic diner with a twist like pancakes and french toast all day but with M Ms in the pancakes if you so choose I had an odd sounding combo balsamic scramble with cayenne pecans and spinach and although I would have never put those things together on my own they were in fact fantastic The homefries accompanying them were passable which is about all you can say of most homefries I have tried in Boston at least these weren t mealy like ones I have had elsewehere Plenty of vegetarian options on the menu was a plus though the sheer number of things with American cheese on them disappointed me Some people may think the decor is either overwhleming obnoxious or just trying to hard in a vaguely punk retro hipster way but I liked the bar covered in decals and edged with mah jong tiles And I am almost certain I heard The Dead Milkmen playing over the stereo so that alone makes me happy I will definitely be back both for the food and for the atmosphere 
-k19zneZa9I4z6vVZNv7gA Harvard Love it One of the best restaurant in Harvard Square High quality food good ambiance though with premium price 
-K5kHLTRQwBEJeM4EEdxRA Harvard This place is really really good I am in love with the little honey chocolates with the bees on them but everything I ve tried is really good The little mice and bunnies are adorable as well The hot chocolate is the best I have ever had hands down I d love to try some of the other coffees and drinks but haven t gotten a chance yet There is some seating inside too which I also really nice I ve yet to find a better chocolate shop in the Boston area 
-k7sQcv8KRdo0CUsh6WMrw Harvard I had a bad feeling when I entered this place It some how felt stuffy and stale and sort of dirty I ordered a chocolate chip muffin and a cappuccino while my friend ordered the eggplant sandwich The muffin was stale the outer of the muffin yes outer layer completely came off the inside wasn t cooked well and was all doughy the coffee was passable the sandwich could ve actually been tasty if the egg plant was like an egg plant should be and if the bread was baked better The seats were torn there were flies flying around the area where the muffins are kept and they charge a lot for the kind of quality they provide in short they should close down 
-k7U-wIR3ppx58Eedq2leQ Harvard This is an institution ripe for replacement It s been around so long the sense of entitlement is bred into it The burgers aren t anything to write home about the tables are cramped the serving staff are variable I rocked up there at 5 minutes to 9pm it always shuts at 9 always and the they refused to do a take out shake for me Seriously Shutting early One thing saves it from a lower score the shakes are pretty damn phenomenal But even still it d take a lot to bring me to go back here give the attitude that pervades the place 
-kadAc78rf75SRKRUJeg8Q Harvard Lunch buffet Too expensive 7 95 Too freakin spicy and I like spice I could not taste a thing 
-KcbWzzvKOdyT-5_f_MdLw Harvard Decent pies by far not the greatest but for 9 we got a 6 slice with cheese and it came out real quick Then again we were kinda drunk and hadn t eaten in 8 hours so it s not like we were picky plus it was pouring rain outside and needed a place to chill for a bit 
-KcsRc4UR5aT8CkfkgIo4A Harvard The last review was from early December and maybe this place has improved the kimchi broth was excellent very homemade ish I make kimchi soup often and the tom kha was ok too much lemongrass The quality of all the vegetables especially the mushrooms was excellent as was the beef and pork My friend had the yaki soba which she devoured I ate everything except for the greens which I didn t like The service was fine although our waiter needed to raise the volume a bit On a cold day like today I was perfectly happy to boil my mouth and fingers with some hot cabbage broth Now I want to go to Shabu Ya 
-kHpvFIUIV_45m4d0Sw75g Harvard I stopped in for some dessert tonight with a friend and we had a lovely time Our desserts were delicious but what really sealed the deal was the wonderful service we got from our server Carolyn She was so friendly attentive knowledgable and an absolute delight I would definitely return to this location we left with our hearts as warm as the molten chocolate inside my friend s cake 
--gi6JWmsws6qNdVytlFAw Princeton A lot of people were excited about this place when it first came out but they have just ok yogurt Maybe less than Ok They are just not tasty However it is pretty comfortable to sit and talk if there s space Overall I would say this is a good place to have some dessert and sit and talk 
-0VR7My64Ksrbq8bKjol0g Princeton This place is down home as you can get that is if you lived in a rent controlled single room occupancy apartment Picture flourescent lights tables and chairs from the 70s and a framed paper poster Their bathroom is spotlessly clean which you ll need to wash your hands after digging into the perfectly fried wings crunchy outside and moist inside The sauce is more on the vinegary side than hot which is how I like my wings since I don t want a purple lip The wings are small or appears to be because the skin is thin I personally like thinner skins The fries are pretty good Not as good as Nathan s Famous or McDonalds but better than most Hamburgers are giant grilled patties on giant sized buns larger in diameter than a Whopper Also cool about this place if you like murder trivia is that the former owners were Lyle and Erik Menendez look them up in Wikipedia 
-13q-Wn9dR449oEEbgXdFw Princeton I ll admit it I was drawn in my the fact that this was the soup made famous by the soup Nazi on Seinfeld I thought I ve heard so much about this place it s got to to be good Man was I wrong I ordered the Italian wedding soup which was horrible It didn t taste like any Italian wedding soup I had ever had It was spicy and there were no meatballs Plus it was almost seven dollars for a little cup of soup I have had way better soup for 1 75 at my local diner This place is way over priced and over hyped 
-17H20-YK6gGymtYkM9YbQ Princeton I think the reason people are so impressed with this restaurant is because 1 It s in Princeton and 2 It s one of the least expensive dining options in the area I have given this place more than enough tries over the years but today was my last visit The menu never changes besides meat centric specials and the waitstaff act like they could care less if you re there or not Service is slow and minimal But the 1 reason that I will not be returning is because for the first time I visited the restroom A restroom is a good reflection of a restaurant because it exhibits whether or not they care as much about what you can t or might not see as well as what you can I expect it to mirror the restaurant s style as well as being clean and stocked at all times Suffice it to say Teresa s institutional unkempt dilapidated restroom did not meet that criteria 
-1r1BY0Z00kB9EgGQ0AJtA Princeton I ve always thought that this place would be like Lahiere s expensive without substance I was wrong I just had the best steak experience ever here The filet mignon was cooked to perfection Minimal seasoning but strong aromatic flavors from the beef itself It was extremely tender and juicy and the texture was otherworldly As the other reviewer mentioned the crowd here do tend to be a bit pretentious and overdressed People are in suits and ties fancy dresses everywhere Don t let that deter you The staff here are very nice The few times we ve been there we went in jeans and t shirts and we were always taken very good care of The only minor down side to this place is the salad The salads we ve tried beet pear were always way too sour For a person who loves vinegar it was still a bit too much for me Bottom Line really good but expensive place for steak Nice atmosphere 
-2I_B8CKI4fVcg44r_ls6w Princeton So i have been here a couple of times I have had good service and I have had horrible service so with that it s a hit or miss I guess Out of the few sushi places I have been to the shrimp tempura rolls are the best here Very big and tasty As for the rest of the stuff I guess it s average I would really give this place 2 1 2 stars but since I can t I bumped it to three stars just cause of the shrimp tempura rolls 
-4EBvsYbeLjxDdg6vgulJw Princeton We like the buffalo chicken pizza here Take out is recommended as the dine in is small 
-4fy42sGpKCdfAo2ttpywA Princeton The appetizers are awesome Out of the buffets I have been to I can say this place wins with appetizers However if you are looking for high quality flavorful sushi this isnt the place It is the average cheap all you can eat buffet If you want to get stuffed then this is the place to go with a group of people If you are really into sushi you will be disappointed with the quality of the sushi fish If you are really hungry and have no where else to go this will do 
-6bFWbeqFVkC_k0Akmw3MA Princeton I love Whole Foods I can always find all of my hard to find stuff that I can t find anywhere else here Yes it is a little pricy but I make sure to buy most of my groceries elsewhere If you want to buy healthy this is the place 
-6cmWv8nhgEIyl8V84YScg Princeton I had lunch here for the first time this week and walked away satisfied I had a prime rib panini fries and slaw Friends had BBQ pork sandwich grilled chicken and lobster roll They all looked good to me I won t put all my chips on Tiger s Tale until I go back a few times but so far the food has been good 
-6oZZn9vCvs_zeI5LK06wQ Princeton An out of town buddy who I haven t seen in a while came to visit Of course I had to take her to my fave eating spot in Princeton Even though we were quite late they were pleasant welcomed us greeted us by name very nice touch although I m sure the maitre d just figured it out from my apologizing for our half hour tardiness and the name on the reservation and seated us immediately in the main dining room Service as always was impeccable throughout The perfect combination of low key so that we could enjoy ourselves and attentive They have three tasting menus with optional wine pairings but you can also order any dish a la carte and they will readily tailor your whole meal without a fuss to your dietary preferences vegan gluten free whatever and suggest better tastier alternatives for certain restrictions as you order Food is fresh and locally grown which makes the dishes delightful My friend and I both opted for a la carte choices rather than sitting through a full tasting menu After the amuse bouche we both started with the field greens salad for our appetizers This salad is not for everyone but since I have an adventurous palate and love things fresh and natural I personally love it As the waitress was putting my plate down I had a moment of panic that it would be drowning in dressing as I had forgotten to ask for the dressing on the side Not to fear it was perfect The naturally peppery sharp flavour of the greens came through enhanced by sweet but slightly tart lychee tomatoes I promptly scarfed the whole thing down It usually comes with chunks of cheese which my friend enjoyed I don t do dairy If you re expecting a traditional salad that s made from the stuff you get at your local supermarket and is then doused in dressing then I would pick something else For our entrees we had the lamb and baby eggplant The lamb came on a bed of beets and oyster mushrooms an unexpected but just delicious savory combination I was going to order the ratatouille but the server suggested the baby eggplant instead I was a little concerned about the ciabatta in the entr e since I m not a huge bread person but there was very little bread Fantastic choice I thought I was going to have an orgasm as I ate the tetrogonia or New Zealand spinach in the entr e which was cooked to perfection I ve never had such tasty vegetables in a dish Perfect mix of textures and flavors Another great choice on the menu is the short ribs We skipped dessert but they brought small brownies and other sweet nibbles with our check and gave us small pre packaged cakes on the way out the door All delicious On other visits I ve sat at the chef s table my first visit upstairs loft private party and of course in the main dining room Personally I prefer the main seating area My only complaint every time I dine here I get sparkling water without ice As it starts to run low the water guy invariably appears out of nowhere to refill my glass with iced tap water My glass is replaced as soon as I point it out but maybe they could develop a system to prevent this minor annoyance As to valet parking I love it Since I am invariably fashionably late the sooner I can abandon my car and sprint into my destination when I m meeting someone the better At any rate this is by far my favourite restaurant in New Jersey I keep coming back because the dishes are always creative use unexpected combinations are modified frequently based on locally available produce and taste sublime Great place for dates or special occasions too 
-6PrANJy2XmHZ-HoI-DHog Princeton Great pressed sandwiches yummy soups and decadent cakes Only downside is that they have few sandwich presses and if you come when it s busy the wait to get your food after ordering can be as long as ten minutes Prices are in line with Palmer square real estate prices 
-6sHFac49degGxjO1QljFQ Princeton I came here with four other people and really enjoyed myself They had a great vibe going on you totally don t expect a huge place at the end of that long hallway The atmosphere is really cool especially if you sit upstairs They have a way back room with better lighting and heating lamps and I was glad we sat there Anyway we had the white bean dip and grilled brie everyone loved these They didn t give us enough pieces of bread so we asked for more and the server was nice enough to do so We all also got drinks IPA Pilsner and Honey I agree they felt watery but some were stronger than others Either way I don t agree that the price was a lot so it didn t hurt to try I did think some of their other drinks choices mixed or wine were pricey so I didn t even touch that Anyway mixed comment time I was overjoyed that they had a good vegetarian option a Seitan Chicken Club I was pretty interested to try this My friend also got it because he wanted to try seitan Well the damn thing didn t even have seitan on it It was like a cold fake soy chicken salad with tempeh as bacon and avocado on the bottom It was good especially on the bun but there was no seitan to be found So they lose a point for having no idea what the hell they are advertising Anyway my friends got burgers thought they were ok They have this ballin mayo aoili dipping sauce and fries I liked those the best Just try it out with some friends and have fun doing so 
-7BiqlQioAeREF_u6jSjFA Princeton Horrible Missed clear as day coffee stains car mats have shit all over it still and the console still dusty I will get my 16 bux back 
-7i5uD-C-SUdeIF_-RVuIw Princeton Really nice decor The sushi is so so The Chinese food is better than most Prices are high and portions are small Service is decent Based on food alone I would have given another star but I always leave this place hungry or feeling like I just got taken 
-8umSeGYLAyobcadOy1LIw Princeton Ugh this place is dirty and the food is terrible Maybe the Indian food is better I doubt I ll be back to check 
-9IrpelIpfvmTe7O_BJxzQ Princeton When you walk into Elements you feel like your entering a very clean zen peaceful environment The decor and ambiance is a lovely change from most of the restaurants in the area We waited for our table at a very small bar with a very nice bartender Despite being crowded you still could talk comfortably and hear eachother at the table Two people in our party had the tasting menu which I would highly recommend Myself on the other had wanted the halibut only to be told they were out of it that evening It is a very different menu and unique presentations I could have done without the popcorn on my polenta appetizer My main course were the Colorado lamb chops which were tasty but a bit salty The dessert and complimentary cookies were lovely I also loved receiving a little sample of their pound cake when I left and enjoyed it the next morning with my tea I intend to go back and explore more of their menu 
-A3xt1tZeNhvUrwfmPtUqA Princeton Came here to celebrate and was not impressed I ve eaten at Gordan Ramsey s restaurant in London I ve eaten at places where my bill has been quite a small fortune I also can say that my favorite Italian restaurant in the area has been Padrinos where the pasta dishes are like 13 and feel like Padrinos is way better than this dump First off their 9 glass of wine is like a tasting 2 sips done and I m still waiting for the appetizer I think my meal was like 34 I got 4 small raviolis I m not a fatty 120lbs but the 4 raviolis was robbery I scraped all the remaining sauce in the bowl with their extremely hard bread just to try to satisfy my appetite Just feel like place is waaaaay over rated If you are looking for a special evening pay the extra money for Elements down the street 
-aFTBYbUbPO09EGQdipAZQ Princeton Well house of cupcakes just won the cupcake war on food network and I still am wondering why the victory may draw some business for the shop but the customers will not be repeat customers my friend and I were so excited to see this shop but couldn t find anything good to say about these cupcakes Very disappointing 
-AgQjhPv7nZHiMUdMwigAQ Princeton EDIT Unfortunately Flavor of India has now become Indian Hut which consists in the same decor and I think the same people running the place but a vastly reduced menu I ve reduced my rating from 5 5 to 3 5 accordingly Our last visit was a disappointment compared to how wonderful Flavor of India was see below for my original review Flavor of India and Ganges are my two favorite Indian restaurants in the area They are far better than Masala Grill Mehek and Kalluri Corner all on or right off of Nassau at Princeton University but they don t seem to get as much business as those three due to their locations Whenever I get a chance I ll invite friends to Flavor of India or Ganges and it s always a hit It s not as good as the Indian places in Toronto but this is as good as it gets around here 
-bPWS36Ow6pi9_ZLmtFBTQ Princeton Cute little clothing store at the end of nassau that normaly not to many people travel down to but I think they should they have a lot of cool things and pretty dresses and they are not expensive like urban expressions anything they have they have at a better price at niko niko and the people are very helpful and friendly The kids in the area still make a mess of things while i m in there being in princeton you would figure they would act better than say someone from a trenton ghetto but this is the main reason that I like to SHOP ALONE here the store is a bit too small for playing around and running around Recently they ve been getting really cute new dresses finishing out the summer and I just can t help myself I have to have it Definitely see it for yourself if you feel like beating the cookie cutter Princeton stores with something a little more fun 
-cBTp5rJtmF3Nwu46Ts5yQ Princeton This is a great little sushi place that s good to be close to The food in general has always been very good if not just a hair on the pricey side Still given the good ingredients and care taken in delivering a dish it s fairly worth it The sushi has always been dependably good and their spicy crunchy rolls have not been bested anywhere in my opinion The more traditional dishes are also very tasty I m not sure how authentic everything is but I go with what my mouth stomach like Jin the owner is very pleasant and she and her husband always seem to be there You can go there one night and be the only ones there and on another night it will be packed It is BYO but they re always ready with an ice bucket for your liquor which should always be sake I would definitely give them the edge and go for 3 5 stars 
-cJBEK-QIdwE2uEQOFZ7UA Princeton I had a strawberry banana smoothie It was made of strawberry banana frozen yogurt strawberries bananas and water It tasted like it had too much water and not enough fruit Next time I ll try the froyo instead 
-CjYR9iSKBXwqle7EaWxxw Princeton The food here was some of the worst I have had Mexican or otherwise I use quotes because the menu items are far from food Mexican My friend ordered the veggie burrito which was mostly just store bought guac They put tomato sauce on the salads Expensive for what you actually get They don t take credit cards The bathrooms are outside Service is slow Otherwise it is ok 
-c_7CbRfhwhGYm1EawMwiQ Princeton When I was growing up in Monty G Shoprite was actually a cool place to hang out You would constantly run in to peers whether it be stocking the shelves smoking out back or being dragged along on a grocery trip with their parents Until I grew up and moved away I never thought there was anything special about Shoprite Well let me tell you it IS world class So many markets I ve visited since those days are grimy offer poor selection Montgomery s Shope Rite is clean The produce is always fresh and they have the most random extras you wouldn t expect to find in a grocery store The employees are competent and helpful Their is a Bank of America I think located inside so you can multi task while shopping Make sure you bring sign up for your savings card 
-dL9eP26h9NYtmnMSKCIsg Princeton Finally got around to checking out D Angelo Market this past Saturday One of the owners had come into our shop back in December and we were all anticipating it opening It was very busy so I strolled up to the hot food line and surveyed my choices I decided on an overstuffed eggplant parm roll 5 95 and a diet soda They were able to warm it up for me too They offered all sorts of different stuffed rolls strombolis calzones and hand made personal pies with very yummy looking toppings lots of fresh basic and simple ingredients nothing too greasy or gooey Their hot foods also featured chicken parm and eggplant parm and hot sides Right next to the hot foods line was a bakery selection The eggplant parm was absolutely wonderful It was thin and crispy with fresh mozz and sauce so good The dough for the rolls was also very good I didn t get a chance to check out the rest of the market as it was very busy but I hope to sometime soon to pick up some more Italian goodies It looks like they also have a deli counter and dry goods They also have plenty of seating if you want to enjoy your food there My only criticism and this could have been affected by the busy traffic was that there wasn t a smooth flow from ordering your food to paying for it I saw a couple of people that had eaten and then paid and I did wait a couple of minutes after receiving my food to pay I m sure this will get straightened out it s also confusing to where you order your food and etc But I will definitely return The price for my sandwich was also very reasonable 
-dtk4HXitOF2d82uBtYiAw Princeton I m pretty shocked at how vocal people are complaining about these cupcakes The cake itself is delicious very fine crumb so moist and great mouth feel The icing is sweet but hey it s icing and should be sweet I d rate these over Magnolia any day My favorite is the salted caramel but the creme brule comes close behind I m surprised by everyone complaining about decor Most bakeries don t have seating It s functional displays the cupcakes and considering the line we have waited in every time we ve visited it s obviously not such a problem The price is fair considering the neighborhood 
-DWSJS6mqggttz6ZKac3hA Princeton My fam bam and I tried this place out for Mother s Day My brother dislikes the city for some strange reason we aren t related okay we are but this reason is enough to say we aren t so he picked a place in the Princeton area The restaurant is pretty small inside but nicely decorated It s BYO so be sure to bring a nice bottle of wine with you The service was impeccable Our waiter was very very knowledgeable about the items on the menu The bread and garlic butter spread was really tasty but I m afraid was the highlight of the meal for me We ordered the fried calamari with soy glaze sweet peppers pesto drizzle for an app and it was really sweet too sweet The calamari was breaded and soaked in a clear sauce Not appetizing to me at all My dad ordered the New England clam chowder and it looked and tasted more like corn chowder Even the waiter agreed I ordered the roast baby rack of lamb and it was also really sweet Cooked perfectly though medium rare All the components on the dish were sweet rather than complimenting It came with sweet potato mash and a slice of pineapple hidden within I guess this can pass as sweet tangy My dad s mahi mahi which was a special for the night was also sweet but cooked well I couldn t help but peek over at the next table and saw they ordered the seared scallops for their app the table on our other side ordered the oysters for their app Dammit We ordered the wrong apps I did like the bathroom though I definitely appreciate stalls that run from the bottom of the floor to the ceiling so you get privacy Did I take a picture Maybe don t judge me If I m in the area again I would come back and try different apps and a different entree With more wine My dad took my wine away after one full glass cuz I was driving back home I didn t argue he has a good 30 years on me 
-E2FyComVJ8mm0STdA36VA Princeton about 2 min drive from work client site Pretty good selection with a lot of hot meals I also like their snack selection here Downside is some things red bull are a bit expensive and not the best baked good selection related to cakes Its similar to a kroger but a lot more catered to people who want to take food to go There is a coffee bar that has a great selection There is daily comfort food pizza sandwiches chinese food some sushi and a pretty big salad bar I like how there are 2 sections of checkouts so its easy to get in and out of the place I wish they had more cheesecakes no worries though There also is food you can take and just warm up near the deli selection Also once you get your food there is a sitting area upstairs and also outside has tables 
-EBDS8sW_26a4uv4lz1zaw Princeton Honestly nothing strikes me in particular about Main Street It s an average place to throw away a few twenties at lunch Have fun I guess 
-ekgYDdeoPPzJlneLM-rOQ Princeton Top notch all around Nothing I can add that hasn t already been said 
-eOSPD9ULfreoZXUs2TCEQ Princeton I would like to re rate this establishment as the management has changed and the service is now exceptional Upon finding my review here on Yelp the new manager of Cutters contacted me immediately curious as to what my previous problems had been and how he could rectify the situation I was completely taken aback by this show of committment and care the manager had heard horror stories from others like mine and wanted to repair the stores reputation as best as he possibly could We were given a cat bed my mother had her eye on free of charge as an apology in addition to a price reduction on a large bag of highly priced cat food The entire staff has been replaced with knowledgeable experts who are amazingly helpful and kind Just yesterday my mom needed to return an opened bag of cat food and they took it back no questions asked for a full refund I will be returning here and though the organic and gourmet cat food is still over priced I will be telling others how the much the place has changed Kudos Cutters 
-eYTuzk6tvALcFnBszykGQ Princeton Honestly I think that if anyone opened a store anywhere in the world where they deep fry their food as much as Haven does you d have a pretty popular fanbase I m proud or should I say not proud to say that I ve had every one of their named sandwiches like the Dirty Sanchez Bloch Big Cat etc Sure what s not to love Its the epitome of a glutton s paradise deep fried steak filled cheese layered eggy 15 inch hoagies that can t be eaten more than two days in a row because they ll cause a heart attack Sure it s intensely satisfying in a way that McDonalds or Burger King tries to emulate that greasy zone where the brain shuts down It s very much like a drug in that respect I think that this place could serve worms if they were sufficiently fried and layered in cheese I have no doubt that people would flock to it wait in lines and rate it highly on sites like Yelp The only reason I don t rate it lower is because well it s good stuff in a I m going to regret this later primeval way that satisfies our carnivore roots For under 10 you can t get a better experience at any other fast food joint But now that I ve had all of their best I usually skip over Haven to some other place in Princeton like George s Roasters next door or the Soupman Go once go twice but don t go after that 
-F-bdkbqz6zilQWfPJyJ0g Princeton It has been said that all human action is driven by desire This being the case there s more action at Sushi Palace than in the latest Terminator flick Here s how it plays out The Sushinator that s you arrive ready to sushinate eat the sushi And you do Insane amounts of it And it only costs you 18 on weeknights All you can eat sushi is the new black these days but this place serves the best I ve tried most of the sushi places in the area up to about 50 person and this one trumps all of them in quality and presentation You can even request your own modifications to the dozens of sashimi sushi and specialty roles Furthermore as one expects in a top notch action context there are futuristic gadgets I recently learned that Sushi Palace has installed a infrared device in the ceiling that measures the angle at which your tea mug is accessed When the angle approaches 45 degrees this is slightly horizontal indicating you ve had oh maybe five to six gulps a staff member arrives to refill your cup with more tea You will never be without tea even for a moment at this place The host is also great the place is hopping especially on weekends but he always has a moment to let you know how the waitlist is looking All I can say is I LL BE BACK 
-F0C0bskJGts_o9P1fUUbQ Princeton This is the ideal meet the parents restaurant in Princeton close to the campus housed in a colonial style brick building right off Palmer Square with a risk averse Italian menu that is sure to please judgy Grandma and nosy adolescent sister alike At least that s the vibe I was picking up at here I think it wants to be an earthy trattoria but it can t help but reflect its conservative clientele The hostess was a bit on the snippy side perhaps because she was hesitant to give up a table for two for this lowly solitary diner on his first evening of his Princeton business trip Nonetheless they seated me at one right next to a senior couple who kept staring at me on my iPhone to alleviate their boredom The crusty bread came quick with a pool of olive oil with a dredge of oregano bits swirling about see photo I first went with the 11 Rucola E Noci which was a good arugula salad mixed with marinated roasted beets goat cheese orange slices and toasted almonds in a cider vinaigrette see photo It was fine nothing outstanding and not quite fresh tasting enough to stand out more in this Californian s memory For my entree I ordered the 19 Garganelli a tube shaped egg pasta which came mixed with spinach Parmesan and sauteed mushrooms see photo Again it was fine nothing wrong with it except maybe a bit paltry in portion considering the price Meanwhile I was watching the pizzettes coming out of their brick oven and thinking that looked pretty good by comparison But that ll have to wait for next time because I have to show Grandma my dorm room and introduce her to my roommate Hey stash my bong away dude FOOD 3 stars hey what s good enough for Grandma AMBIANCE 3 5 stars casual and convivial SERVICE 3 stars everyone looks a little impatient TOTAL 3 stars like I said risk averse I m surprised this is part of the same restaurant group that handles the exceptional Eno Terra in Kingston 
-FjmwkxoE0H8qScdLiyN5Q Princeton Awesome breakfast place Great thing you can look forward to if coming in on redeye from West Coast Although their coffee isn t the best But the pancakes are and that s why you eat there 
-FPHUXM9UJ_514UfVwuY0Q Princeton Fabulous Filet and the crab cocktail a protein lover s delight I ve enjoyed this place since it opened and I have to say it s been consistant I ve always found the service to be wonderful and feel bad for the reviewers that were less than satisfied The ambiance at night is warm and inviting just like a great glass of the red wines they offer Happy hours can be boisterous so if you are looking for quiet chose chose a later hour Outdoor patio is a wonderful spot to people watch while drinking one of the unique beer selections they offer 
-fSEZvHdYCxfipPsAjtONg Princeton i always dismissed this place because 1 i m a vegetarian and 2 since i grew up in the area i have seen many different restaurants pass through this location seasons anyone my family and i went out to dinner here on christmas eve and i was pleasantly surprised although there were few veg things on the menu the waitress had the chef make me grilled tofu skewers with teriyaki sauce over sauteed vegetables and rice YUM i was not too impressed with the two different wines i had the malbec and a cabernet sauvignon but my uncle had better luck with his ketel one martinis he had FOUR my mom thought the chilean sea bass was excellent and everyone loved the wasabi mashed potatoes the owner manager was hanging around and seemed genuinely interested in checking up on tables to make sure they were having a good time overall it s a pretty nice place good decor and it certainly beats all the chains around on route one 
-g8sAvLQ7w-kie_qilyC_Q Princeton I have tried four different flavor however they were all just like cheap supermarket cupcakes Nothing impressive at all Go to Small World and get a red velvet cupcake with your coffee all the best 
-g8uta68awN5D6-WKbU7BA Princeton Unfortunately I fell in love with Ted s photography before I came into contact with him Its a shame that someone with such growing talent can be so unprofessional After a week of trying to get into contact with Ted he finally returned my email At first he seemed nice but still a little new to the field He wasn t entirely unprofessional at this point he was just young After finding out that he had the date of our wedding available he asked my partner and I to tell him a little bit about ourselves I sent out the email and that same day my mother who was planning our wedding called him to finalize the contract and set up an appointment to meet face to face He told her that he would prefer not to talk on the phone and that he would rather do his business via email My mother informed him that she is a wedding planner and would very much like to meet him face to face and also establish a relationship so that she may use him for future clients After a few minutes of him asking her to repeat everything she said and still going on about how he d rather talk via email the conversation ended Even after this we gave him the benefit of the doubt because his work was very good for the price Perhaps he d had a bad day or was under circumstances where he could not talk these things happen right Well i went back to emailing with him like asked and I asked him to send me over a copy of the contract He said he d gladly do that Great things are finally under way That s what i thought until four days later i had not yet received his contract or a response from my email asking about it On the forth day i finally received an email from him saying that he had changed his mind and would not do our wedding Now im pretty sure that he is a homophobe which is a sad story because i have a lot of friends who are also gay getting married and would have loved his work The only good thing i have to say about ted is that his cost to quality ratio is very good Other than that he is unprofessional and homophobic 
-GtSjvKOAQ70HEY1-Ychiw Princeton P F always holds a special place in my heart this was my first classy Asian restaurant At one point in my life I didn t know that Chinese food stretched further then my neighborhood china buffet And then 2 good friends brought me here You could only imagine how I felt when I saw those horse statues out front of the building I give this place 3 stars because I have since indulged in much better establishments particularly ones that are not chains However the food here is generally good Everything has a fresh taste and is presented nicely The service is usually good and the waitstaff puts on a nice little show for you if you tell them that Its your first time PF virgins well get a kick out of what they have to say They also have a pleasing drink list The plum wine PFX and the Plum Collins are a few must trys They even have a long list of Sake if your into that I always get a kick out of dessert so much yummie goodness I usaully have a hard time deciding what little Mini Dessert I m going to choose Come here and enjoy the food and the environment the decor is beautiful 
-GYjoBazy0jggvCwR6Z1tg Princeton The chipotle mayonnaise is outstanding and the beer is QUITE good Honestly some people would find a way to complain even if they had undergone a total complainectomy and six weeks recovery 
-hB5nvDzJyoDpWfhTFvwEw Princeton This is a perfectly nice hotel and a good option in the Princeton area I stayed here for a wedding recently and we received a heavily discounted rate on the room as part of the wedding group I m not sure if I would rate the Westin as favorably if I had paid full price for our room Still it was clean and comfortable with a good shower an important criteria in my book The staff were friendly I was especially pleased with their shuttle service to the surrounding area which is a fantastic option if you don t rent a car as taxi fares definitely add up The Starbucks in the lobby is a nice convenient option since the surrounding amenities at the Forrestal Village are a bit dire 
-hrDWqXXJlNbiRkOfo6WrQ Princeton I had lunch at Teresa s on a weekday in 3 05 It s a light filled and charming restaurant and it seemed very popular The food was delicious the service was excellent and the prices were moderate 
-hxqljjvzYZ35TgzFBgzYQ Princeton Arguably one the best Mexican restaurants in Princeton but still not fantastic by any means Their dishes are overly cheesy and sauced just like they do at the chain restaurants not authentic at all The food is pretty good just NOT authentic If you want authentic try Viva Mexico in Flemington They only take cash and parking is a pain I d rather eat at Taste of Mexico 
-iE21Qemhijsr8dF-iOP1w Princeton This should have 1 5 but I d like to play nice We ve decided that this is spice central for Princeton Thai Mexican Indian We took in a bottle of rum to mix with a diet coke and mango lassi Ordered steak tacos and chicken fajitas with green tomatillo and spicy sauce Well it s Princeton The tacos were deep fried as mini burritos with the unseasoned steak pieces inside Served on top a shredded salad with sour cream infused guacamole much to my dismay as I can t eat sour cream but this was his dish I m glad I noticed that the guac was a little too bright avocados aren t that white so we asked and were told what we thought was the case Bummer Chicken fajitas not the separated variety grilled on one side warm tortillas on the other but fried with everything on top The chicken was good but not Mexican Good cheese too but not Mexican i m really trying here The tomatillo green sauce was very good light fresh hot spice wise The spicy sauce grew on me but using dried spices which were still dry in the sauce bugged me I ve been too spoiled with Chicago and California Mexican salsas The food was good enough not great I couldn t eat the pan fried tortillas as they were greasy before even the peppers chicken and cheese were added fajitas don t have cheese usually It was tasty but I so miss Mexican food that I m entertaining the idea of going to Mexico Chicago or California to get my fix The people were really nice food was delivered to the table It cost us a total of 17 for 2 
-ihwtFyzYAdE57A45GEMaA Princeton I ve come here a couple of times brunch and dinner Service is friendly and the ambiance is great Attire is casual which I absolutely love It doesn t feel stuffy or snooty it s just a relaxing and comfortable environment The food is good and you don t have to pay through the nose for a steak My favorite thing on the menu is their Classic Burger one of the best burgers I ve had It s nice and juicy served with lettuce and tomato on a great bun not your typical soft hamburger bun Oh and don t let me forget the KC fries homemade potato chips that are simply divine 
-IZvuqxekWEvJqDw308daQ Princeton Good quality pasta The sauces are refreshing I like the set up of the store 
-JB-lrdNl6oP28pw5DE3bA Princeton fancier and prettier mall than the others Very small with the popular stores like Victoria Secrets Anthropologie Gap Brookstone and Barnes and Noble The food court has a huge selections of food including my favorite Teriyaki Boys It also has a movie theatre not bad a nice quiet non crowded mall to check out 
-jHC9vDC1XOK3s94BqmRHQ Princeton Yummy I come here with my family all the time every time we visit sometimes for lunch but most of the time for dinner We usually order a bunch of dishes just because there s usually about 10 of us But all the food we order is good I especially like their Nian Gao I can never find any other place that makes it this way in LA The decor is ok It might need a little updating but it s not so bad Enough space for small and large groups I want to eat here again 
-jqGsAn0a-x5k6jOJlbgNw Princeton I live and die by their rib dinner ribs with tender fall off the bone meat with a delicious rib sauce along with amazing fresh out of the fryer sweet potato fries 
-JT3HkMXAaFvSw1MvjED3A Princeton Lobster bisque out of this world Price was extremely reasonable This place is a hidden Jem 
-junSxB4GVUpBtUbf4pddg Princeton This is real Italian wood fired pizza Not a Jersey slice place but artisan pizza using ultra fresh ingredients Very similar to Nomad in Hopewell but not as crazy busy yet We dined on the deck here last night and really enjoyed it all The highlight was the pizza with prosciutto arugula and shaved parmesan It s BYOB so bring your favorite to enjoy Service was a bit of a let down as plates and crusts were left on the table way too long Not a big deal and we look forward to returning again soon 
-JvtnCXjGtYxmUcRQC5N9A Princeton Rooms are huge nice comfy beds However if you get a room here that is at the front of the hotel and you are even slightly prone to waking up during the night you will suffer Trucks that go by on route 1 sound like they are in your room On more than one occasion as a truck went by lamps etc could be heard shaking 
-KJP9tcUEWbm2mQnWvhGSQ Princeton Only white people who don t know anything about real Chinese food would go to this restaurant and call it good 
-Kjr8TxR6WWE2_npknJdWg Princeton The Triumph Brewing Company is an acceptable bar It has good beers they brew themselves and good food all a little expensive Unfortunately it may be the best Princeton has to offer which is a tragedy This place would be great as an alternative to many other good bars but as the best Princeton has it s just not good enough The first thing is that it s crowded I went on a Tuesday night and couldn t find a seat and had to wait half an hour for a table Most good college bars are crowded but the layout of this place doesn t make the crowd feel like a communal experience Its bar area is long and narrow which makes it difficult to mingle The restaurant is broken up into levels so that you feel alone Feeling alone in a large crowd is not easy but Triumph makes it happen There s a good selection of liquor and wine I m a beer man so I went straight for the beer The wheat beer was recommended by people on this site I tried it and found it good The Irish Stout was okay but I m not a stout guy The Irish Red was a little too heavy for me I like Killian s Irish Red but this was darker and heavier The beers were a little expensive more than 6 per Frankly this is a lot for a beer and especially a lot for beers that are just good I would not go out of my way to drink any of these three beers again and if I went back to Triumph I would only order the honey wheat The food was good Much better than the beer I had the vegetarian chili and found it surprisingly hearty I also sampled the roast arctic char and the pumpkin ravioli All were good They were sophisticated dishes cooked well with high quality ingredients Let s be frank though They were the cheapest entrees on the menu and overpriced at that We ordered them because the real dishes were a lot more I don t look for expensive foods at a bar I look for greasy food that goes well with beer However if you want expensive food this place is not bad Overall I liked Triumph okay If I was in Princeton again I would go there Its environment is not good its beer is okay its food is good and everything is slightly overpriced 
-KLSSCBASUgofNpI3zTOaQ Princeton Blueclone Networks are the Best IT Company we have found Always on time and consistently providing excellent service Give the a call 
-KoDDJMsrgGox98KHP5FLg Princeton This place is super deceptive due to the small door and huge area inside with multiple floors The service is a bit slow due to layout and just things take long but oh well I got the pumpkin beer which i was very happy with since it was pretty late in the season Everyone else seemed to be enjoying their beers They had a great deal on the flights and had many options I m not normally a beer person but id come back for beer and probably only that The menu was divided up in appeitizers paninis salads sorta sad looking and real food dinners The appeitizers were calamari which was standard the tuna raw which came out in small pieces probably more for 2 3 people to share and the crab tater tots which were also not enough food For 9 people 3 appeitizers was sadly not remotely enough One of my coworkers got the last salad which was a mix of walnuts apples cranberries and she got grilled chicken on it The fries you can get as a side or with burger was very good esp with the sauce similar to the ones served at TGIF chipotle mayo flavored The Tbone steak was over cooked look a bit dry too and the lamb was often cooked over or very well The Triumph burger was good but not as good as the one at salt creek grill by a long shot I did like how you can put mushrooms cheese good choices and other things with it The sliders also were very small even compared to ruby tuesday free sliders There was a german first on menu under dinner food that was very large portions 5 different types of sausages and sides that looked awesome The prices were reasonable between 9 and 29 tbone steak The hanger steak at 18 was suppose to be pretty good and the salads and burgers were 10 13 dollars with sides

-KXX9-oWf2o4uNXiSrlK6w Princeton I went to Triumph last Thursday with some coworkers after work for dinner I had never been to this Triumph although I have frequented the New Hope location several times It was interesting seeing how each venue had their own unique style I really liked the vaulted ceilings and wide open space We were seated in a booth on the lower level I ordered the Bengal Gold IPA which was excellent Our group started with the Calamari which was quite tasty The batter was light and non greasy and the marinara sauce was better than your typical rendition For my entree I ordered the Fish and Chips I am a Fish and Chip lover and I was very happy with my order The fries were crispy and golden and the fish was flaky and moist Other members of my party had burgers and ribs Every meal looked great and there were no leftovers All in all it was a really fun evening and the food was very satisfying I would definitely recommend grabbing a drink or a meal at Triumph 
-KZIDiL6gd7TLMPY3j-Kog Princeton Authentic and tasty Chinese food Their Shanghai soup dumplings xiao long bao are AMAZING with a thin skin and lots of soup The skin is just thick enough that it won t puncture when you re picking it up but not too thick that it ruins the skin to meat ratio I have eaten plenty of XLB in my lifetime from China to LA and I d say that these rank pretty highly in my book We also got Loofah with gluten Pretty good but some of the loofah si gua didn t seem fresh It had an interesting side taste that I can t exactly pinpoint but it was sill good nonetheless Recommended Bean Curd Skins with mustard greens and soy beans Xue Cai Mao I thought it was fine but my mother wasn t a huge fan The bean curd skins were the kind that you could buy at a Chinese supermarket The dishes were kind of oily but nothing overwhelming and somewhat expected at a Chinese restaurant The service was fine and the decor was actually quite nice perhaps I m just used to hole in the wall Chinese restaurants Unfortunately a bit pricey but from what I ve been gathering that s expected here Pleasant first meal in the Princeton area and I ll probably be back to try the nian gao and chicken with water chestnuts So to sum up in four words GET THE SOUP DUMPLINGS 
-L0FMiYksxprrxc7iPNgWA Princeton Very very adorable shop that sells olive oils and balsamic vinegars belongs right in Palmer Square Along the wall are gorgeous plates that look spanish or turkish I wouldn t buy the plates but it enriches the ambiance All the products oils and vinegars are displayed with descriptions in how to use it and what it taste like Also to taste the oils C C offers fresh soft bread in a canister to taste the olive oils which really hits it home in the sales department I was sold Must have been sourdough because everything tasted good I bought the chipotle olive oil and definitely encourage all you try to this smoky extra virgin olive oil The lime infused and garlic were also nice but not unique enough for my first purchase p Why not a 5 I didn t get a hello when I walked in someone was pierced over a computer I didn t get a do you have certain flavors you like are you looking for oils or vinegar nothing not a word until I picked what oil I wanted took it to the register and she said 12 95 and thank you I m sure they get customers who come in and don t purchase anything and just want to try but I did purchase something and even if I hadn t make the patrons feel comfortable

-LqP7iNkVe3Oo6VW1voDjA Princeton I ve been to a lot of sushi places in my day Many of them have been better than this but many have also been worse I had lunch and sushi with a friend and for the money the food was okay It was definitely nothing to write home about The service was wierd and the ambiance off If you re looking for something nice try one of the other sushi places in town 
-LsgmAAJDKLdu_H9uqNN-A Princeton We made a reservation for dinner on 8 31 and tried elements for the first time we had a gift certificate What a wonderful dining experience The food was fantastic and the chef accommodated and surprised us with an excellent dinner one of us is vegetarian The staff and service were impeccable We also enjoyed four amazing cocktails We particularly loved the Privateer It was extremely generous of the bartender magician to share the recipe ingredients and musings behind this cocktail on his blog We were so taken by this tantalizing drink that we had to find and procure all the fantastic ingredients to make these at our home bar These will tide us over till our next visit and we re very appreciative Can t wait to return for more culinary and cocktail experiences we re fans 
-l_-rp2zqODe9Ycz4aIy-g Princeton After reviewing Grom in New York I wondered what people had to say about Bent Spoon my favorite ice cream spot in the US Bent Spoon is much better than places like Grom despite the hype the long line and the prices 3 50 for a filling small portion of two flavors mainly because unlike Grom and others it is worth the hype the prices are still less than New York prices despite similar rent issues and the lines are not longer than say the line for Magnolia or Grom This is not ice cream you eat a whole pint of in one sitting to fill up there s the cheaper option Halo Pub around the corner for that And this is not where you find American flavors like Oreo cookie or cookie dough or moose tracks This is where you get very rich very tasty unique flavors like heirloom tomato candied ginger Turkish coffee avocado olive oil blood orange chocolate jabenero cardamom as well as some more classic flavors like the double chocolate ice cream or sorbet which tastes just like the ice cream They use local ingredients as much as possible The ice cream is seasonal You get amazing coconut ice cream when the coconuts are good and fresh You get the best chocolate hazelnut ice cream during hazelnut season which tastes like the ice cream version of Nutella As for the crowd well they are townies and students nothing too obnoxious not more than I have experienced in New York for example The serving staff are friendly The owners are very nice friendly and they will remember you Don t forget to try the cookies the cupcakes beats Magnolia in New York any day But I never understood why people liked cupcakes so I would never pay this price for some cupcake anywhere and the jabanero hot chocolate which will turn into thick chocolate guck if you leave it to cool it s that thick and rich 
-M3wRUMbDdGgYRH9XpyCpw Princeton This is my A number one choice for when I need to grab lunch in Princeton Their salads are great they ll make a sandwich how you want it and I ve been pleasantly surprised by their specials Plus the peach almond muffin for dietary reasons it would be better to treat it as a cupcake is amazing 
-mDKbCtnn79kKgV4OPF1yg Princeton Very good very large menu everything was excellent Matza ball soup is very good even has some extra noodles It s not on the menu but I wanted soup and a sandwich but knew I couldn t eat both so I asked for a cup of soup and half sandwich perfect The pickle bar is also fun There is so much more than sandwiches something for everyone A great to go area as well Highly recommend 
-meg1WiwgOsctPPEHHeTaw Princeton I will occasionally stop in for a quick lunch but the thought of the unfriendly staff here usually keeps me driving on by Lucy s food selection is pretty basic salads pasta dishes of course some nice bread

-mlLrSwmof_OGJ1ia_FfCA Princeton This is a mostly glowing review I had gone to another salon in the area for a wedding hair and makeup trial that didn t end up working out I then made an appointment at SydneyAlbert for another trial I asked at the time if I should make placeholder appointments for myself and my bridesmaids on the day of the wedding since by the time the trial rolled around it would only be 3 weeks away they assured me that tehy would have room and I should wait until I knew I was happy with the results Fast forward 3 weeks I got both my hair and my makeup done by Darlene who was absolutely fantastic She s a whiz with both hair and makeup and was able to deal with my issues dark and puffy undereye circles not wanting the usual dark lined smokyeye special etc with ease and grace I looked fantastic and was super enthused Then I made an appointment for myself my two bridesmaids and my mother A day later they called to tell me that they were booked that day and couldn t fit usin at the same time we could all use the same one person Darlene but we d have to block out at least 5 hours for us all to get our hair and makeup done Needless to say I freaked a little bit I didn t go Bridezilla but I did make it clear that there was no way I had a spare 5 hours on my wedding day to spend at the salon waiting for everyone to get done by the same person Luckily I got a hold of the manager who did end up resolving the issue but it did take 2 days before it was all settled and it was a nerve wracking time Happy ending though we all showed up on the day of the wedding and they were ready for us it did run a little late because the earlier appointments hadn t finished at our start times but I can t really complain when all 4 of us walked out of there 2 hours later looking like a million bucks I had Darlene again and she worked her magic exactly like the trial my hair which was styled down held its curl througout the entire day and the makeup did not slide off or run at all I can t remember the names of other stylists but they all did bang up jobs too I think my mom had Dawn I m not sure but if anyone can make my mom happy they re ok in my book So if there s a Dawn too I vouch for her All in all I would go back for sure Just make sure to confirm your appointments 
-mlQbzFu5cpxNfjImehGKA Princeton I am shocked that Iano s doesn t have more reviews GREAT pizza dough thin with the perfect level of chewiness and crispiness Clean and affordable And before visiting Iano s I could not understand why people love cheesesteaks so much Iano s made me a cheesesteak believer yum yum can t wait to go back next weekend 
-NFSA9yl7ChcynPlWzEqHQ Princeton Some weird insane compulsions at this restaurant I attempted to join 4 friends sitting at a table here for an early dinner The place was empty The waitress got offended upset and only said no no no with these huge wide upset eyes I mean just at the QUESTION she became visibly upset They could have said no without being jerks about it right None of us were from Princeton so I guess we didn t know the rules of the sushi place Do you go looking for rules every time you walk into a restaurant I feel bad that people in Princeton have to deal with some crazy people because there s just no other sushi place PS I have many asian including Japanese colleages and friends I ve been to Tokyo I ve eaten at a millions of sushi joints I m part asian I know how to conduct myself respectfully in public These guys are just self indulgently quirky and rude

-On2qKoBU-ZEepcP_8hzMw Princeton Conte s is not a pizzeria It s a bar that serves pizza That s a big distinction so lower those expectations Got them lowered OK then now that your threshold for quality pizza is lower than my self esteem in the men s locker room at my gym I can say this is good bar pizza the kind that goes perfectly with a Hefenweiser with a slice of lemon It s not a student hangout for the Ivy Leaguers Oh no This hole in the wall place is for the rest of Princeton the regular folk And they do come here in droves Coming in on a Tuesday at 6PM with colleagues the place was already nearly packed They already have the little pizza stands at the table to save time The veteran waitress who served us was surly but the beers came pretty quickly followed by two big pizzas one just plain Cheese see photo the other a combination special with lots of goodies on top see photo of a slice It s low maintenance food for a high maintenance conversation Nothing fancy The End FOOD 3 stars good working class pizza for the rest of us AMBIANCE 3 stars just a bar and a crowded one at that SERVICE 2 5 stars Joisey style manners TOTAL 3 stars nothing fancy but solid food to be had 
-ORu7EiC3DfZjeKOVQ5ulQ Princeton I regularly went to get pad thai usually or other stuff here and while they weren t great it was good enough to have for lunch I agree with other people saying it is kind of pricy The service is usually good 
-PALO6MUBB0ZtFFm6D8H1A Princeton I ve been visiting Hoagie Haven since I went to high school at West Windsor Plainsboro South Years later I m still addicted to the place Although I miss the Bengali guys that used to make my food without any gloves on this place is the greatest I wish the current staff spoke better english and were better at taking orders I am a huge fan of the fat cats and make SURE you get the buffalo cheese fries I can t even imagine how much more ridiculous Hoagie Havens business would be if Princeton had more night life Hoagie Haven loyalist for life 
-PEo-bsETZAMZiQMh5Wukg Princeton Sunday lunch Shared mezze sampler that was utterly forgetable baba ganoush red pepper black bean hummus all sadly lacking in flavor Things improved once we moved onto our mains Ricotta Gnocchi was delicious silky light little pillows in a cherry tomato pesto cream sauce The Orecchiette dish was superb with house made pork sausage escarole garlic roasted cherry tomatoes Parmigiano broth Service left something to be desired We arrived 11 50am were told by the tween hostess that it would be 10 minutes before we could be seated A couple came in as we were walking out got seated right away Waiter seemed surprised when I asked him to replace my glass of wine as the one he brought had a ton of floating cork sediment and was half the normal portion Wine leftovers from night before Sloppy 
-PrJ16Dqeoewify5pWzEug Princeton Ummm so my cupcake obsession is in full force I now look up cupcake bakeries wherever I m going ha I know sad but true I happened upon this place in Jersey and I have to say I was so pleasantly surprised by how delectably delicious these little cupcakes are I went in to try one and left with half a dozen The presentation of the cupcakes are so neat and adorable The flavors are fun so far I ve tried the strawberry fields mocha and vanilla with each one I keep saying after every bite mmmmm amazing These definitely rival any nyc cupcake bakery and I think with the going rate these days 2 is more than worth it for these little dreams Oh and by the way the interior has a really fresh and inviting feel to it and the women who helped me was a doll Go here It is probably the best attraction in Plainsboro 
-PVCcuUtebICDthMx_TrQQ Princeton Honestly I went here a second time because someone LOVED and RAVED about this place and it was horrendous The food was incredibly cheesy hello the flavor does not come from cheese alone The prices were HIGH given the type of food given here And no credit card accepted Wtf Bottomline this place parades as a hip cantina style restaurant and because it s in princeton they charge exorbitant prices Drive the extra distance to Jose Tejas in Woodbridge NJ 
-q3vYbT3L5PnFuKyZba_lQ Princeton Wow I ve been an avid Mexican food fan my entire life and have tried pretty much everything in the area including Philly and this place blew them all way I haven t Mexican this good since my trip out to San Diego and Kaliente still beat them out I ordered a shredded steak burrito with tomato rice lettuce onion tomatoes jalapenos refried rice and shredded cheese on a habanero wrap It was the size a small soccer ball and tasted amazing My friend ordered the chicken version on a regular wrap without jalapenos and raved about it This place completely tops the other two Mexican eateries in Princeton Two burritos and a soda was 16 44 and worth every penny I will be back again and again 
-Q7uHGtXaqVcvmdUfbzDuA Princeton Best bagels Ever So effing fresh and delicious it makes me sad there is no place that compares to this fine establishment in Boston Cream cheese is whipped I think so it s light and tasty I also got lox from there once too and once again amazing I should have taken advantage of this place more while I was in high school seriously nothing around me now compares Weird thing about this place is that I ALWAYS see someone I know in there from high school ALWAYS 
-Qjf5pHs-XxWLR1SkYvnxA Princeton Ok Wegman s is a great store Tons of Eye Candy great prepared food some fancy dancy stuff you won t find at the local grocery On that side of the coin they are a 4 or 5 They are however pricey and inconvenient to get to That complex basically has one way in and one way out Be prepared to wait around getting in and out Not my idea of a grocery store I d give them a 1 or 2 So to be fair they are a 3 stars

-QmpmuUAg4UDfCaYLSe-OA Princeton I scan the parking lot frantically There s about 10 SUVs in the parking lot Each huge Each black Each gleaming in the sun They all look the same Crap I hike my pants up and start moving from car to car peering in the windows praying I won t set off any alarms This is what my brother likes to call fun As I try to locate his black Dodge Durango in the Wegman s parking lot my brother is laughing in the front seat the AC on full blast while 90 s jams pump on the radio My sister is not impressed my sister You know she doesn t know what your car looks like my brother Uh I ve had the same car for two years now It s about time she remembers what it looks like I m teaching her an important life lesson A good 10 minutes go by I m about to give up I call them on my phone My clothes are sticky and the ice cream in my shopping cart is beginning to melt My sister finally picks up my sister sigh We re on the right Just walk straight ahead this game is getting really old Me Tell me about it I begin to unload our cart The ten minutes of parking lot frenzy barely phase me because we now have a trunk full of Wegman s groceries Growing up we were a Shoprite house Eugh I hated Shoprite The food never tasted fresh and all of the Shoprite brand stuff was lame Their neon lighting would give me a headache and it was always cart banging swearing chaos But it was close and my mom had this thing against Pennington Market So Shoprite dictated much of my elementary school diet But once college rolled around it was a whole new shopping playing field We graduated to Wegmans Wegmans was and is supermarket genius All those taunts about New Jersey being the armpit of America puhlease have you met Wegmans Wegman s could whoop Safeway Shaw s and could probably upper cut Trader Joe s well maybe not Trader Joe s Trader Joe s is pretty smooth and would probably do a fake out too Wegmans does NJ proud Their main draw is their affordable ready made gourmet items Everything is exceptional Their fruit and vegetables glow and the fish and meat department always have marinade and cooking tips to offer It s foodie utopia not to mention every house wife s dream In fact with a nursery in house and a liquor store next store I have a feeling that most who enter Wegman s don t want to go home Wegman s was my go to spot for Cozy Shack butterscotch pudding fresh olives and angel food cake In between spoonfuls of pudding and smushed angel food cake I d get comfortable on the couch grab a pen and start writing my next grocery list Sniff A salty tear welling up in my eye I miss Wegmans 
-qRjH-lwyt85F905Ced8PQ Princeton I went to Mo C Mo C first time to try out the food I went there around 4PM and the place was nice and quite just the way I like it so I can enjoy my food I ordered the following as I was with 4 other friends Lobster salad Spicy yellow tail roll Sashimi deluxe Toro Yakitori And two other dishes I asked for Chief s special creation of mix rolls and sushi pieces for 3 people First the lobster salad was to die for It has this sweet dressing over the honeydew and lobster made a great combination in the mouth The presentation of the rolls and sashimi were absolutely beautiful that I felt bad to take a bit But I was too hungry by the smell aroma of the Toro Yakitory soooo we down everything fairly quickly The place is cozy and quiet and as it gets dark out the lightening from the window outside looks directly into the sushi bar very nice view Since i ts BYOB we had plenty fun on top of the great food The only thing I don t like is that it s get busy and quick I guess people find this new place fast 
-qtMKUffHsYWDA3cVt00FQ Princeton I was EXTREMELY impressed with this restaurant First of all it was packed which is always a good sign but ample seating so getting seated was not a hassle and did not take more than two minutes I loved the simple menu it was not overwhelming and everything on the menu looked appetizing Now the food was out of this world My girlfriend ordered the lobster macaroni and cheese which was phenomenal and I ordered the chicken dish cannot recall the name that was mind blowing The flavor of the chicken was so delicious and expertly paired on a bed of creamed corn and spinach On top of the wonderful food the atmosphere was great Live jazz on Tuesday nights and a great interior Not too loud so talking is not too difficult and the wine list was more than satisfactory I was very impressed with my experience and will definitely be returning

-sVClsz3zpdp2lmeA_2yXA Princeton Always inconsistent The owner is never around and the staff doesn t seem to care about quality Pizza can be great or just awful with burnt crust I would agree with previous reviewers about the quality of their pita sandwiches The falafel can be very hard at times to simply great other times 
-sz2dYZkrmKBeRqVKwfCFg Princeton I was in Plainsboro for 2 weeks for work at the end of October The first week I stayed at Wyndham and decided to book at the Doubletree the last week since it was cheaper maybe booking a weekend arrival makes a difference I don t think I wanted to stay at the same hotel for 2 weeks anyway I was in Philly for the weekend so on my way back I couldn t find the address of the hotel on my GPS Since I knew it was off Rt 1 I thought I would just drive up and look for it What I didn t realize was that I had to drive further than I thought it was and I was driving in circles for 20 minutes before I finally found the address on my phone s GPS That was a little frustrating but it was partially my fault When I walked in the first thing the front desk attendant said to me was Glad you could finally make it I m guessing I was the last guest to check in that night He finally told me that there was another address I had to input for the GPS Would have been great to mention that on your website But he was very friendly and made my night more calmer He gave me a warm and delicious cookie that I thought was really nice The hotel is very nice There is a small store next to the front desk if you need snacks laundry detergent and anything a traveler would need I was able to score some plastic utensils after when my take out order didn t have any There is a washer and drier on each floor I believe It was only 1 50 to do a load which is reasonably priced The gym is small but with great equipment Individual tvs for each machine and your standard weights The swimming pool was indoors and the water was heated nicely Also music plays throughout the first floor even in the gym and swimming pool My room was very nice and comfortable The bathroom was beautiful and each room has an energy efficient thermostat The Neutrogena bath samples were nice as well Every morning I received USA Today and they even called to check in to see how I was doing I was also able to score a refrigerator for 10 night since I was sick of eating out all the time The location of the hotel is right off Rt 1 South and you can get to Plainsboro and Princeton easily I would definitely stay here again if I have to come back here for work 
-T6PTeXXG4wYLzdmEmpVxQ Princeton This is a good place to have a quick meal The variety is great Don t get misguided by the name this place has much more than cakes There is a good collection of South Indian dosas vadas and the likes My favorite is the sambar vada but is unfortunately available only on weekends The Dosas Idlys Uthappams etc are prepared fresh and are nice hot and very edible Besides the South Indian items there are sandwich varieties and other street food prepared safely away from the streets The wraps paninis etc are quite good as well and very filling In addition there are all kinds of puffs with all kinds of vegetarian and non vegetarian fillings I for myself am a vegetarian and cannot speak for the meaty kind Other things to try those pastries that are single serve This is not a proper sit down restaurant even though there is place to sit The constant crowd movement makes it noisy and cold in winter I would recommend trying this place out there is something for everyone 
-TGOmBlxZW-v3rfyp5TUQg Princeton Best pepperoni pizza of all time the pepperoni is so rich greasy and what dreams are made of I only get around to coming here once or twice a year when visiting the best friend s parents so we always end up getting a large and almost eating it all this is 2 girls were talking about Don t question it s appearance or the way they make you order wait around then sit down and eat That s just the way things are 
-tI8Xs6usOK_TYSnMMDlOw Princeton Very minimally standard Weston Of course they had our reservation wrong when we arrived Luckily the front desk staff were very helpful The rooms were standard fare Luckily they have those beds otherwise it wouldn t be worth it The Forrestal Village is an especially poor example of neo new town planning It is deserted after 5 00pm 
-TnuUqPPl8gvKsdh2b0KDg Princeton Wait time of an hour or more and during that time the stylists spent plenty of time in the back chatting with each other No management to speak of and people just kept walking out frustrated The haircut itself was only ok and for 18 23 it s certainly no bargain Wasn t surprised when the staff asked what Yelp was I will not be going back 
-TR5aFkYoA00jRrQoZmBCw Princeton My name is carved into many tables here I ve been going to PJ s since I was a little kid I love their pancakes and mashed brown 
-u1cEL6lRa2iykQrkJvPww Princeton I love the huge veggie sampler platter Entrees are large so if you can t eat a lot at one sitting be prepared to get the rest in a to go box Service is friendly maybe slightly on the slow side but I think that s because many items are made from scratch rather than just kept under heat lamps in the back The matriarch who presides over the dining room can be a little cranky Definitely recommended 
-u9Kel3UPMaMVOZzEoi3fg Princeton 4 stars because of what the yelp literally says Yay I m a fan It is almost surprising that a city like Princeton small but with a lot of rich people suburbians and a UNIVERSITY seriously doesn t even have a handful of dining options I guess that made the PF Chang an instant success when it first opened a little more than 5 years ago When I first got there from Los Angeles where PF Chang is just a good option I couldn t understand why I had to wait for more than an hour and a half for a table here I rarely reviewed on a franchise and will never do much but wanna write a good review about my experiences here because of the scarcity of dining options at Princeton I think the ambience is great for that price service is usually fine but could be a hit or miss During the numerous visits lunch dinner take outs late nights you name it my favorites were the chicken lettuce wrap mongolian beef dali chicken which I believe is off the menu now orange peeled beef chicken honey crispy chicken shrimp and the last but not the least the chicken noodle soup Ever since my wife bought it for me long time ago I am in love with it I guess my review could well apply for other branches in the US Still in Princeton this sure is a solid option for nice dinner 
-UGSkc5pB4Z4xsPdOAoSEg Princeton The key thing with Carousel is to arrive with the right set of expectations Compare this place to PJ s in your mind and you will be happy with it It s open far longer than merely for breakfast but I only go there for my Sunday breakfast with the fam There s something for everyone on the menu even the most discriminating of young sons who hates nearly everything unless it comes with fries and the omelets are very good Huge menu The decor is much less interesting than the old Carousel but they ve kept a couple of the touches from the old place to give it an explanation of the name which is fine as far as it goes Recently they ve been raising the prices and that better stop or they will price themselves into a whole different set of competition Less greasy than a greasy spoon more comfortable than a diner food for any taste and all at a semi reasonable price That s why I like Carousel 
-uhoJyI_TcWPb-ryNts1bg Princeton I have ordered from Da s several times as I am an employee at the YMCA the organization with which the restaurant shares the facility SInce the cafe is just down the hall from my office it is an easy way to scrounge up lunch or dinner if I forget to bring my own I m hard on Thai restaurants because I became a fan of Thai food while living in Seattle which has an amazing array of Thai options which unfortunately for everyone else has set the bar pretty high The things I ve ordered have been a little hit or miss The western menu is not really worth the time so if you must give them a go go with the Thai infusion menu Usually when I order Thai I go for curries without hesitation since they are my favorite I ve ordered the Panang with wide rice noodles a few times and that s been good The rest of the things I ve ordered from the menu I could take or leave it s fairly generic Though I have to say nothing I ve ordered has ever been from Da herself since she doesn t do the day shift I will herald the Thai Iced Teas because good ones are hard to find and are non existant in Princeton I used to order them regularly from Da s during long work shifts and one of the employees there used to make great big ones for me Since then they ve started making them smaller and smaller so I ve stopped ordering them I ve actually stopped going to Da s altogether because of an unfortunate customer service incident I m a huge stickler for quality service when it comes to food service so I don t really take bad experiences lightly and they will turn me off to places entirely This one involved a staff member refusing to run my credit card under the 10 minimum required I had no cash I was a regular at that point and he absolutely refused to do it and raised his voice to me in the process I ve seen no need to go back since then If you re desperate for a Thai fix in Princeton check it out Da herself is incredibly sweet and takes great pride in her restaurant and abilities as a chef She even offers Thai cooking classes through the cafe if you re interested 
-uIdK6egYB6j2XNQZRKlXg Princeton Great food Good fun Good prices 
-umwNJfp9XeMUH7SjRdQnQ Princeton The varieties of puri and chaat are outstanding here I d avoid the Indian Chinese fusion combinations and go for the rest of the menu This place has the best okra dishes in town in my view and the mango lassi tastes fresher somehow than the same beverage at Mehek Flavor of India and Ganges are my two favorite Indian restaurants in the area They are far better than Masala Grill Mehek and Kalluri Corner all on or right off of Nassau at Princeton University but they don t seem to get as much business as those three due to their locations Whenever I get a chance I ll invite friends to Flavor of India or Ganges and it s always a hit It s not as good as the Indian places in Toronto but this is as good as it gets around here 
-UO-30CndTaDa6CgmbLTmw Princeton The catering sub tray is awesome People loved it 
-UYdB2T1UFhLzFrx1VmXtg Princeton Update I got an email from a stylist at La Jolie who seems very cool He wasn t the one who gave me the terrible experience I had there last time but he apologized for it anyway and wanted to make it right What an awesome guy I already have an appointment elsewhere to get my hair cut tomorrow so I won t be taking him up on his offer but it was definitely appreciated If you are going to check out La Jolie I d recommend trying to get an appointment with him Check out his great reviews from others here If I don t like the cut I get tomorrow I ll definitely try to get an appointment with him next if he can fit me in 
-V6vli_FxT3q2-ITaQJTdQ Princeton Doesn t quite have the magic of the Marketfair location but I m a fan nevertheless Sad that the Marketfair location closed I ve found myself in Forrestal Village a few times recently enjoying this TB It tastes close to the other location but just slightly different Still for less than 10 bucks you can get a delicious fast japanese meal Give it a go don t let the location fool you 
-VfKP3BDEVtjmpisF2QZAQ Princeton I just took a trip to the west coast where froyo is everywhere and cheap Twist is a highly welcome and opportune for me addition to Princeton It s considerably healthier than ice cream or gelato no fat and has all that pro biotic goodness added Of course this doesn t mean I ll be giving up my Bent Spoon or Halo any time soon but Twist offers a relatively guilt free product at a great location I ve since sampled all of the flavors except for vanilla My favorite is the EuroTart followed by Green Tea and then the Original The topping selection is superb There is a great assortment of fresh fruits nuts granola mochi and it s good too and then the unhealthy stuff Prices were definitely resonable more expensive than Cali but muchhhh cheaper than what they rip me off with in DC Twist is open late midnight on weeknights even It seems like a great hangout place for students who are looking for somewhere a little different somewhat off campus that s not Starbucks or Panera Bread Twist also offers free wi fi comfy chairs and there s a tv on that always seems to be playing CNN that seems a bit more DC to me than Princeton but that s not a bad thing Oh And this week they were offering 25 any purchase after 10pm for students Sweet deal I went twice I dock one star because it s simply not as cheap as the froyo I had last week even with a 25 discount Also it s cash only which is kind of annoying since my bank doesn t have an ATM anywhere in NJ and I have to pay a service fee P If I was in the area for more of the year I would definitely be a regular Alas DC beckons tonight BUT for those who will be sticking around check Twist out You will not be disappointed 
-VLCpo_RNrP_wuUXDoiHJg Princeton Yes unfortunately my weekend of sub par experiences and awful bars continues I was on my way home from Trenton this weekend when I got caught in the 100 year flood Ok maybe it wasn t that bad but it was pouring out I was having trouble seeing and I was getting annoyed so I decided I needed a beer I went on my phone and saw what was in the area and the Tap Room looked pretty cool So after parking down the street and sprinting through the pouring rain I arrived The first thing I did was grab some napkins and wiped my face down since I was literally soaked through my shirt Once I was done I put the stack of maybe 5 or 6 napkins down next to me at the bar Pretty reasonable thing to do right So the bartender walks up to me and I try to make some small talk Man its raining out hard I had to stop and get a beer Her response with a cold look was what is this garbage Really Is that really the way you going to start are experience I m not in the mood and I it s not like I brought my trash from home and dumped it on the bar It was a couple of bar napkins I didn t want to let that ruin my whole experience so I tried to move on She asked me what I d like to drink and I wasn t quite sure I asked her if I could try the Weyebacher She responds to me once again with an attitude what do you mean try Most bars let you try a small sample of the beer and if yours doesn t just let me know but I don t need an attitude So to finish my rant I guzzled me beer left exact change and walked out I am a great tipper I worked in a restaurant for 3 years This woman did not deserve a dime of my hard earned money On top of my experience the Tap Room seemed stuffy and unwelcoming I looked at the menu and it was over priced and nothing special I agree with Jessica other then the pictures of famous alumni on the wall this place makes you wish you never stopped 
-vVmGX8vK8MR9Q6QSPlnGA Princeton Yummy bagel croutons Very flavorful and perfectly crunchy 
-VyQY7Y0oTcO-H_Y04z8aA Princeton This restaurant is by far one of the best I ve been to in Princeton and I ve lived here all my life I was lucky enough to partake in one of the Chefs tasting meals at the chefs table where Chef Scott Anderson delighted my friends and I with the most incredible selection of presentations I ve ever had The servers were wonderful and friendly the meal was exquisite Chef Anderson came out personally with each course and the drink menu was just plain awesome If you have any sort of occasion I suggest Elements more on the expensive side but the best meal you ll ever have 
-w7fag31mryOHbpiBE6XqQ Princeton ZOMG This place is AWESOME It s an all you can eat sushi and kitchen items salads soups teriyaki It s only like 18 95 a head their tag line is to Order All You Can Eat But Eat All that You Order They re not into waste and obviously no take home Their sushi rolls are outstanding their butterfly roll is a mango roll with a sweet chili sauce NOM Great dessert roll Anything spicy tuna spicy salmon all nomtastic Points deducted because my husband doesn t eat sushi He ordered chicken teriyaki he said it wasn t very good Sigh It s a BYOB but they also give tea as complimentary Fantastic whenever I visit my friends who live in the area we always try to get out here 
-Wq-Qwd_vk8bzs-yWzxY4A Princeton being european i have to say that the ice cream is overrated but for princeton halo pub is the best and cheapest way to go staff is always patient and polite the milkshakes are great tahitian vanilla is my favourite 
-XBntoBkVe-KNKRgwVxEOQ Princeton People around here seem to LOVE fruity yogurt and I can give some reasons It s COOL to make your own yogurt and the manager is the FRIENDLIEST PERSON EVER However coming from Southern California I would say this is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR ITS QUALITY I thoroughly enjoy Fruity Yogurt until I see the price it s like what 5 6 for a little bit of yogurt toppings Honestly with that price I could get a relatively large pinkberry or red mango yogurt in Southern California in which the consistency quality is a lot better However I still enjoy the variety of flavors but my favorite always stands with plain So now the most important question for those that obviously can t go travel to socal every time they want yogurt Fruity Yogurt or Twist Both are pretty expensive Fruity Yogurt for Boba and Fruity Yogurt for the yogurt but Twist for the toppings That s just my take on it 
-XBujGSwYWD9XbK6idTuPA Princeton Best ice cream within a 6 371km radius Halo Pub is good but Bent Spoon is about as good as it gets 
-xenpapIkGXRCe_zk0kS0Q Princeton OK here is the deal with Pizza Star It s not the best pizza in town that title definitely goes to Old World Pizza over on Nassau street but that place is for fancy Italian plumber gourmands who can t handle the reality of American pizza When it comes to your classic positively dripping with grease pizza with a large surface area that necessitates folding Pizza Star is the place for you in the 08540 When it comes to ordering 900 pizzas for your kid s weekend crayola birthday bash or whatever Pizza Star is the place for you Pizza Star has been the go to pizza place in Princeton for years and you re only going to disappoint your party goers when you bust out weird ass pies from Contes or Mossimos or whatever other non Star spot That is unless you re paying the premium and getting the Old World Pizza but then they re probably going to be uncomfortable what with all that unnecessary extravagance Yay pizza star Also I have heard that they have many other items on their menu that aren t pizza but this may be a myth 
-xfTWSK9WNrScSRj9276rA Princeton As a Restaurant this is a great place to meet friends have a drink stay away from the 17 glasses of wine and then go somewhere else for dinner Prices totally outweigh the quality in actuality the food was equivalent to the Longhorn Steak House just a fancier atmosphere With all the choices in this area don t waste your time here 
-xGme0ftHjQS9Tfqu2Uqmw Princeton Amazing coffee sweets and ever some decent options for a quick lunch the soups in particular are good Always a good atmosphere if you feel like doing some work on the laptop but still want to be around other people 
-Y2XnC5QAphSkWSHKXbFHg Princeton I was a big fan of their flavors except for Kiwi The kiwi flavored yogurt tasted so chemically Boo BUT the mango plain tart lychee and strawberry was very delicious and creamy I actually think this is my favorite yogurt store so far Unfortunately the toppings were mediocre and normal in comparison to the next froyo store but at least they were fresh and delicious If you would like to see the environment and yogurt for yourself watch my video http youtu be AbccIOQQ28A 
-YDCNg_wOJ7NbjSplDp3Aw Princeton I bought some Blue Buffalo Wilderness today It was an OK experience The store is improving its selection every year but customer service is lacking And the shelves are messy 
-YjN3v_rqlm2n8aqPws_Bw Princeton There is not and there will never be a better cupcake than this bakery provides My brother works for the town which is how I originally found this gem I d have cupcakes from shops in Red Bank from Hoboken NYC sugar sunshine takes the cup cake every time My personal favorite is their chocolate chocolate cupcake and also the chocolate cupcake with strawberry buttercream Kudos for sugar sunshine and the no frill beyond delicious cupcakes and treats they provide 
-YNiGCRAXDhS-ppsrHn4hg Princeton Its just ok Its a nice place they run it very well etc but hte food is just ok Definitely a popular place though always very crowded requires reservations etc 
-yqXD4_Tk5IS-iubkJTWwg Princeton Are you kidding fellow yelpers Bad reveiws due to service It s a bakery who cares Are you tipping them No instead you re asking for a brioche and a baguette and then you re on your way The bread and pastries here are excellent and I have no doubt any Frenchman would agree If you re giving this place a bad review you probably belong in your local food store bakery anyway 
-z1wSPoMW9whenkmrj-yYg Princeton I m not certain that whoever is in charge of leasing Princeton commercial properties remembers that we already have four Indian restaurants in town Would it really hurt to change it up a little Despite my misgivings I thought perhaps that Tandoori Bite had something new and exciting to offer that the others didn t Dinner here was more expensive than I imagined on par with Masala Grill prices and appears to specialize in saucy gravy curry based dishes The food comes in 3 spiciness levels mild medium hot I ordered medium and it barely had a kick Kind of disappointing My mutter paneer otherwise tasted fine though had a pronounced layer of grease on top Sits pretty heavy on the stomach Perhaps I should try the lunch buffet So in summary Princeton Indian restaurants are a bit lacking especially compared with the more authentic offerings just a few miles east on Rt 27 Still waiting for the inevitable moment that yet another Indian place opens in Princeton and hopefully that one will actually be good 
-Z9BgifY9HULI5qyS9WNfA Princeton Blew way past my expectations of a burger place Innovative set up and the service was incredible Definitely comming back 
-ZPWnCc8BHDrGhcfPFKSfA Princeton I too have been coming here for years although it s been a long time since the last time Great spot for a casual yet good bite to eat Good burgers and we are fans of the Irish nachos Good beer too

-_VP7A6fVEGMtAp9VSJhaw Princeton This beautiful Greek deli located on Witherspoon has so many delicious choices for lunch dinner I ve sampled many of their fresh selections but the falafel and the hummus stand out as my favorites There are no tables inside but a small counter with stools in the back I usually grab something to take home or eat on a bench nearby You won t be disappointed as everything is fresh and tasty and expensive They cater too 
0-aegivpLuxtQZpLmkW0tg Princeton Decent South Indian food yet the chaat items are nothing too great Everything is overpriced for such a mere bakery What really outrages me is their rude customer service I for one would take my business somewhere else 
0-i0_adKUKM66PfNUC_KXg Princeton We used to come here every now and then but not anymore The last time we were there a few months ago There was an unwelcome visitor came to our table A COCKROACH came to our table I understand this is probably not uncommon at most restaurants but seeing it LIVE is a different story I will not go back again 
0-TcQPqWNkXpy4CGfGEhlQ Princeton I am surprised that this place has gotten such negative reviews I haven t been disappointed the last 2 times I have been here I remember that the Beef house noodles were really good The sesame chicken had a funny taste to it like it wasn t fresh or something was in the batter But like what everyone else said I think you will have a great time if you stick with the noodle dishes 
00cWjqKeOPhADzXscIIEdQ Princeton Bryan is a fantastic stylist and a sweetheart He gave me a sleek update to my basic buzz and cut and transformed two of my friends from plain to office friendly but fun I recommend him for a men s cut especially if you re looking to transform your style Trust his recommendations and you ll be pleased 
00HMm1C27MnUP4IhR7SS8Q Princeton Sushi wise just ok i dont think i d ever go for sashimi or anything but the rolls were fine service was good byo dranks i d go again 
00txJQyKXauO5Enev79DNw Princeton I wonder if the denizens of Princeton are miffed that Yelp s highest rated restaurant in their fair city is this unadorned sandwich shop with a steady stream of undergrads ordering their submarine sammies to transport back to their dorm rooms I had been curious about the place on my last two business trips here but never found the opportunity to go until now I ordered half of a cold hoagie the Provolone Cheese Pressed Ham and Salami see photos What did I think It was exactly what I wanted Speedy service Dirt cheap at just 3 50 Sloppy with all the fixings piling out What I didn t expect and I believe this is the clincher for people is the soft fresh Italian torpedo roll that housed all the ingredients It doesn t look like the bread is baked on the premises but it sure tastes like it The sliced meats are definitely a cut above the machine processed cold cuts Subway appears to use and the oil and vinegar doesn t have a rancid after taste Besides I walked in and out in less than four minutes FOOD 4 stars the secret is in the roll everything else falls into place AMBIANCE 3 stars not sure what to say except the makers wear plastic gloves SERVICE 4 stars not much for chit chat turnover is their goal TOTAL 4 stars hey if I was a Princeton undergrad in the middle of finals and out of Chex Mix and beer this is where I d go too 
01fdHhdVbDVPb93FGgH95g Princeton I wish there were more Lindt stores in this area but they ve all closed I only shop here because the Freehold and Oxford Valley stores are gone On my last visit the women working were busy while there were customers in the store I asked for one of the nicer cellophane bags as I was shopping for a gift and I got a crazy look While in line behind another woman mid transaction I was called to the next register The cashier was upset she had to reboot the second register to allow me to pay for my expensive chocolates Oh the horror I won t support this store anymore they don t deserve the business When I worked across the street and visited regularly I was treated the same The managers are awful here and rude 
01oXDhRCTjbuRuuIgKQqeA Princeton Bagel Hole has the best tasting bagels around seriously No competition in central jersey The place looks dingy but the bagels the sandwiches the rolls the cream cheese everything it s just amazing The price is alright but it s so worth it The bagel are hand made and all the cream cheese are home made too You can call in to make orders making things a lot faster during busy hours You can make weird requests like jelly on a BEC cinnamon bagel and it ends up tasting delicious Very popular spot for high schoolers My favorite is the toasted blueberry bagel If in the mood I d add raisin walnut cream cheese 
01t1DKhyp-Bnogs2aiadDw Princeton I LOVE HOAGIES Even if it will kill me Give me a Sanchez please extra dirty 
02JtpTMu1QOVx-o3LM4D-A Princeton This restaurant is bare and stark from the front but pleasant modern inside We dined in the wine cellar as we were a party of 9 The staff was pleasant and efficient The food was far too ambitious for the kitchen and seasoning was either missing or too heavy handed especially in the overly spicy clams with no other seasoning and the so called foie gras with sauces which overwhelmed the palate Snails in puff pastry tasted as if they had been dumped from the can some bland sauce circling the plate far away from the escargots Wines are quite nice 
02yoYni5VEnlpanbvitc7g Princeton This place should be called Nassau Sushi but for some reason or another Yelp refuses to change the name on this business If I could I d give this place 3 5 stars Mmmm I can only imagine when this place served both bagels AND sushi what a deal Would you like a poppyseed bagel with your fatty tuna Or perhaps sundried tomatos with your yellowtail How about some cream cheese with your eel Apparently the owners realized how unique they were and decided to drop the bagels instead they ve revamped into a place selling Korean and Japanese food I ve been here twice ordering from their Korean menu both times The first time I ordered the Dolsot Bimbimbap sp which is the stone bowl version of the veg meat rice mix The bowl was pretty hot but not hot enough to crisp the rice Quite disappointing actually I had been hoping for something not so soggy The bimbimbap itself was kinda eh as the vegetables couldn t muster a wimper and didn t really add to the flavor of the bowl What I really needed was hot sauce though I can t remember now if I actually got any For the price though I don t think I got a fantastic deal The second time I came here today actually I ordered the Kimchee jigae the kimchee soup mixed with beef and veggies Luckily this dish came out fairly tasty The rice they served was a little on the wetter side I personally prefer drier rice That way I can douse my soup all over my bowl and come with something not completely soggy Fortunately they ve retained the Korean tradition of providing free appetizers Expect some kimchee when you sit down and maybe some sour spinach D I really liked their cucumber ish salad Pros Korean food in Princeton Mmm Korean appetizers Cons A little on the pricey side drop prices a bit and you might get 4 stars Verdict Middling Korean restaurant in Princeton that might satisfy your craving for Korean favs Keep in mind their selection is a little on the weak side and their prices could be a tad lower 
03IZQ2BYe4eRye516SpVVg Princeton Did a month here and I was pleasantly surprised Plenty of cardio equipment weight lifting machines and free weights I never had to wait for anything Plenty of paper towels spray and hand sanitizer to keep everything clean No funky smells Several TVs spread across 5 different channels Staff was very polite and helpful The pool is on the smaller side but I never used it and I don t usually swim as part of my exercise routine so I can t say if that s a big drawback or not Locker rooms the men s room at least are clean and have plenty of lockers The sauna was on the larger side got plenty hot and was very clean I was expecting a bit of a dingy meathead type gym I PICK UP HEAVY THINGS AND PUT THEM BACK DOWN but instead it was a very clean well equipped low pressure gym In the end I didn t join but I still might but the rates were very reasonable based on the facilities 
03Z-Dx7IIkGHbpUx-0Cbjg Princeton Ajihei is probably one of the only authentic Japanese restaurants in Central Jersey It s what you can expect from a real Japanese dining experience small space authentic food and real Japanese green tea The food is beyond doubt the best of its kind in Princeton Other places such as Tomo Ichiban Zen MoC MoC don t even compare Sakura Express is a whole other beast and I assume that people going there know what they re getting into for ridiculously cheap sushi Always served to perfection Ajihei does not take any shortcuts Their ingredients are mostly straight from Japan Ajihei is slightly pricier than other comparable restaurants in Princeton but the quality is beyond comparison For similar sushi anywhere else the price tag would have been much higher I must admit what I am most obsessed about is their tea authentic powered green tea that you can taste the difference of Tea like this is pretty expensive and you won t get it anywhere else The only discount factor for Ajihei is their small space and its associated complications Staff are sometimes so overwhelmed that it s hard to get your tea water refilled or you order processed fast enough during peak hours Long wait times for a table and inability to accommodate large groups are also annoying Bottom Line best quality sushi in Princeton Small space hence long lines during peak hours no reservations accepted 
04cErBTjO1rxF5O4YPL8WA Princeton Very professional Be aware that the price is 2 per supplementary person 
04Clp-Jgs2o-38Rx8tjeSA Princeton We have been here twice Both times we had salads and pizza The first time we recalled really liking the pizza and thinking that the salads were fine The pizza reminded us of the thin crust we ate in Siena This last time the pizza crust was burnt Some people may like that but it overpowered the other flavors The salads were tiny and the chicken had no flavor at all The restaurant feels very cosmopolitan and the wait staff is professional The wait for a table can be extremely long 
04KGBt7Izy6RttrE3jHWCg Princeton Delicious cupcakes The desserts here are made with no preservatives or artificial ingredients it definitely makes a difference We got the following to sample Very Vanilla Vanilla w Vanilla Frosting Classic Combo Vanilla w Choc Frosting Lemon Lovely Coco Loco Strawberry Fields Strawberry w Strawberry Buttercream Mocha Delight Choc w Coffee Buttercream The ones that were my favorites were the Classic Combo I love it when a cupcake place makes a classic cupcake right the vanilla cake was the perfect golden cake or a light angel food cake w the choc frosting being a creamy milk chocolate the Lemon Lovely was just the right amount of tartness not sour at all the Coco Loco was like a heavenly coconut cloud in your mouth I didn t really like the Strawberry Fields or Mocha Delight the cake was a bit dry compared to the delicious vanilla golden cakes of the other cupcakes The frosting they use is amazing it reminds me of Sprinkles cupcakes frosting not too sweet soft the right amount of creaminess I also loved how they were frosted w the perfect swirl on top For 2 a cupcake they were definitely worth it I definitely will go back we also wanted to try their red velvet which they didn t have available when we went They should totally open one of these in NYC 
04rukel7bpug5qivmGCRZA Princeton I liked this place alot They give HUGE portions I actually ate my entire plate on one visit 1 1 2 lbs of ribs My bf was mortified at my piggish eating sooo good I ve also been here just to drink and always had a great time Laid back sometimes crowded Always a great time1 
0595osDe6UXSYDO_K3HqTw Princeton Didn t actually get to eat there even though the menu was very tempting There were 2 customers ahead of me they were together and 1 customer behind me Even though there were 3 people behind the counter no one thought to ask me what I wanted while the 2 ahead of me tried to make up their mind I left as well as the customer behind me 
05Qfj2l1DJfvPmMnrcnUYw Princeton Nice decor outdoor seating The pulled pork sandwich was 14 and bland at best I don t know why but bland seems to be the running theme at most places in Princeton and Witherspoon Grill is no exception update Really good crab cake but rather pricey at 16 To be honest I don t think I ll come back unless my boss is paying again 
06cd-eCZANYXuGhXexgB5w Princeton The ice cream is cheap but not mouth watering On the other hand the coffee is both cheap and excellent You can get a machiato with a donut for 0 90 including tax That s unheard of If you come around 8 30 or 9 in the morning you might see Shirley Tilghman Princeton U president and a regular at Halo Pub 
06nwV1CUZ6SBrIHWCkDZqQ Princeton Lahiere s is closing next month or at least that s what the rumors would have you believe This Princeton institution owned by two succeeding generations of the same family is going extinct So go get your fill of duck and risotto while you still can My favorite part of the restaurant is the bar and the bartender a great character where we ve had dinner many times The Bistro atmosphere makes for a fun evening Lahiere s menu has needed refurbishing for years just like the rooms themselves but the owners have steadily milked the business for cash and I suppose anyone with half a brain would have seen the sale coming long ago It s a shame because the location is tremendous the main room is well sized and it has a liquor license These are the simple prerequisites for success in Princeton A decent chef a good wine list and pleasant decor would top things off nicely making for a place customers would come to again and again but not to be The owners just don e have their hearts in it anymore I guess So say goodbye to this venerable spot the good wines the great staff and the fun bartender 
06RYyw_tZAYACYqpHkLqUA Princeton I ve known this restaurant for years and according to regulars who have been there this restaurant has been around since 1997 Compared to Ivy Garden every Princeton resident who has lived in the area in the past decade knows that Tiger Noodles has stood the test of time while Ivy Garden has shifted ownership multiple times Currently as of this review Ivy Garden doesn t exist anymore and no new restaurants have moved into the place I have been all over the Princeton area for 10 years now and I can confidently say that Tiger Noodles is the best around I ve seen a variety of people come to eat here and whether you re a college student or just a resident looked for some grub this place is affordable beautiful outdoor seating weather permitting and good overall service Seems to be always busy and packed every time I step in Food is very good probably the closest you can get to the real thing in NYC Chinatown The owners of this place also own two more Ya Ya Noodles just off of Route 206 in the Montgomery Shopping Center and another Tiger Noodles in the Windsor Greens Shopping Center off of Route 1 and I ve been to those locations too and both off their own unique experiences too As for service I have never had an issue with the waiters or the managers they are always kind and remember me by name when I stop in I don t particularly understand why this awesome place gets so many negative reviews but I guess haters are gonna hate Must go if you are a newcomer to Princeton NOTE They do NOT take credit cards but there are ATM machines everywhere in downtown Princeton so that s not too bad 
06WKBLy1lyuoJuTQtArOmw Princeton This place is awesome I love that the experiment with flavors heirloom tomato concord grape etc etc and I love that the flavor selection changes throughout the day It makes going here an unpredictable exciting experiment I will say that their flavors are sometimes a little hit or miss and not everything they try to pull off appeals to me but they get a pass on this because you can try anything you want for free before you buy it Further when they nail a flavor they really nail it They make the best pistachio ice cream I have ever had and I am somewhat of an expert on pistachio ice cream and the Bartlett pair and blood orange were awesomely intense This is the one of the must see food destinations in Princeton 
0920hWhDTAICt782aHJn7w Princeton You know the drill when it s time to hit an orchard in the fall cider donuts pumpkin gourd patches apple picking petting zoo farm market kids galore etc And Terhune Orchards has all that in spades The big standout for me WINERY on the premises This should be a must for every orchard If you have kids you ll need a drink And if you don t have kids like myself you ll need to drink even more in order to deal with the little brats Just kidding I love kids So I did the wine tasting of 5 wines for 5 and ended up buying two bottles The Apple Wine something I definitely would not have thought I d ever like as I m more into reds is made using the apple cider from their very own orchard I became an instant convert to dry crisp fruity wines Also bought a bottle of the Front Porch Breeze as a gift for my Mom a very strawberry blush Regretting not having bought a third bottle a medium body red Chambourcin with such a clean finish it left me wanting another sip and then another Other standouts for picking this orchard over any other the farm market is stocked full of organic vegetables and fruit from their 200 acre farm it s much smaller in scale than a few other orchards I ve been to you can cut your own flowers delicious baked pies 
0924CigTgL5T8-qTr0fowA Princeton I come to this place couple times a month although the service is not the best their food is always consistent If you don t want to wait 2 hours on weekends I would recommend showing up at 6 the latest if not you will be waiting for a while for a table I am not sure why they take reservations because they can never honor it on a busy night If you want decent sushi with the right price and lots of selections this place is for you If you are looking for five star services then you should look else where 
094PeGYgc71DjD0ygKCr7g Princeton Great service The food came out with good timing and everything was fresh and delicious We wanted to try out some side dishes and made that our appetizer We had the adult mac cheese and brussel sprouts with andouille Both were great We tried the potato chips which were totally yum as well I had the house salad I know I am boring but it was great and it was huge My bf had the Blackened Tuna sandwich it was tastey but he was expecting something else Over all I would say the quality and service is there The menu isn t very big but the taste it there I would def go back again 
09xXxOYeRrz_r1VnUALscg Princeton Hand and fist above most in the area which considering the amount of disposable income is pretty shocking The environment and decor were quite upscale and hip not a personal favorite but was done well for the style They have a great beer list for a restaurant It s not Eulogy or Monks but had a few good Belgian beers I was not expecting Staff was very attentive and pleasant not overly fawning or on the other side snooty which can be an issue for me as I do not dress to the nines to go out to eat Started with a Pork Belly appetizer that was incredibly moist and a flavorful blend of distractions around it I would go again just for this Had the Muscovy Duck entree which was three styles of duck breast confit sausage with a tiny cassoulet I ordered the breast rare and it came as such which is generally not the case It was tender and savory The confit was delicious and not over dry in the least The sausage was the weak point of the whole meal it was dry though tasty We had no time for dessert as some of the diners had to rush to an event but they brought out a nice plate of petit fours one of which was a fruit jelly my personal weakness Overall I definitely advise dining here if you are looking for a meal you previously would have to travel to Philadelphia to get On a side note we had arrived late and only had forty five minutes for dinner and asked our waitress if that was a problem and she did not in the least seem put out and made sure everything came out in a timely manner We in no way felt rushed or left behind Been back multiple times and just wow this is THE spot to eat in Central NJ There are also two grades of tasting menu one which is just selections off the menu and another which the chef cooks just for you I advise you take the time and have the latter 
0B0UEijYPDd_-37uPTHiYw Princeton Cupcakes are like homemade not to much flare to them but fine by me as some stores which are heavy on the top i e Whole Foods miss the cake to frosting ratio and serve up visual atrocities which I d rather avoid The space is large and mostly empty there are limited cases the staff is pleasant I like it 
0B30ZynPFY_eYk4Bi-F5Gw Princeton It really is a real Amish Market not that marketing bs you usually find in PA The chicken is top quality much better than what you can find in most supermarkets and even some of the better quality markets There s a real flavor to it real nice I haven t had breakfast there yet but it smells heavenly if you go in the morning I ve heard they have great stuff It s like a combination of six or seven different shops almost all run by Amish folks Try the couscous from the bakery I ll wait for someone to try a pretzel and let us know how it is They musst be good the Amish know pretzels A great place all in all Another fine review by S G Whoop whoop whoop 
0b50RxP52uwJTDEZy-U1GA Princeton Some of the best sushi I ve been able to find in the Princeton area Small place with simple decor but excellent cuts of sushi Some of the best eel I ve ever had so if ur an Unagi fan don t let the Market Price scare u off It s worth whatever the market is dictating Loved the tuna handroll always like when u can actually see the fish in a spicy tuna roll I highly recommend this place if ur like me are all about good sushi I had to open my own wine bottle BYO couldn t get take out on valentine s day but I m over it Service was friendly enough for me but place is small RSVP recommended 
0BBiT8OXPrCOnIoLP5GdgQ Princeton this place is overrated it s just buffalo wings If you don t like them you aren t going to like the ones here either Buffalo wing sauce tastes exactly as expected The only difference you may taste is the wings are crispier than usual Sesame noodles are just cold noodles with sesame and cilantro there is nothing special about it and it s certainly not worth mentioning as great would not come again 
0blRj63Nj_Bb_-cvubsaKA Princeton Halo Pub was a staple of my teenage years again i m a fat baby love me some junk food We d go walk into town after school and get yummy homemade ice cream then spend the afternoon sitting around Palmer Square smoking cigarettes and being cool hey we were rebels Go for a cup with some toppings they have TONS of different kinds and are generous with them Damn now I want some ice cream 
0BPuIp6IIemeZAwYAP9SOg Princeton This is a wonderful restaurant The staff is extremely nice and helpful The menu is a little tricky as it s assumed that you know what s in a philly roll for example But outside of that they have a good variety of dishes from sushi to thai to malaysian food so it s really great I ve been here a few times and never been disappointed 
0ccuscuuuN4MpQfpxL_GDA Princeton I am ashamed that I ve lived nearby for so long and only recently made my first visit here Admission is free there is a donation box by the door and the suggested donation is 5 not that the university needs any more money but whatever The ladies at the welcome desk were friendly and helpful The university maintains a small shop near the entrance to the museum as is usually the case with museum shops things are on the pricey side but they do carry some books that look absolutely fascinating I visited the museum specifically for the Architecture as Icon exhibit running through early June 2010 The exhibit was a bit on the small side but they had amazing pieces including a handwritten copy of The Ladder of Divine Ascent by St John Climacus from around 1 000 A D Awesome I was also pleased that the educational literature provided on Eastern Orthodox Christianity and its use of icons seemed to be accurate I am Orthodox and am very used to the propagation of misinformation regarding both the history of icons and their use in Orthodox worship Thankfully this exhibit hits the nail on the head Of course one could make the argument that icons belong in churches and homes where they may be venerated and used as an aid to worship and therefore do not belong in museums but I am very glad that I was given the opportunity to see icons that I would otherwise have never had the chance to view in person I haven t yet explored the other wings of the museum but I ll be back very soon Check it out 
0czRZESrnAenizg_3q7YBA Princeton If you re not sure what to get I recommend starting with the roti canai pronounced chanai appetizer a freshly prepared flat bread which you tear up and dip into a chicken and potato curry I always get the penang char kway teow a seafood dry fried rice noodle contains shrimp and calamari among other things Other favorites the Thai basil noodle a little spicy the mango chicken and the very sweet and flavorful Thai style ice coffee or ice tea 
0d-iyUPAE9BloMrWNvG8Ag Princeton i got my nails did here yesterday i mean it s your typical nail salon the women who do nails speak broken english and there is a heavy chemical smell i got a french manicure and it is chipping already the day after 2 stars because they were not clear on what i had to do i e go wash my hands or put my fingers in the bowl they can speak y know 1 star for not putting a second coat of varnish on and now it s chipping but 1 star because my cuticles have never been so neat 
0dMN_oByLuHDVmLO2QPBjw Princeton Meh sums this place up The food was just meh I love diners and most of the time I can find something I like I went to the Princetonian with my brother and his roomate and we all had breakfast I ordered the challah french toast with two poached eggs The french toast was very bland and I didn t finish it The eggs were fine but the coffee was really terrible like it had been sitting out for some time The service was good but I left wishing we had gone somewhere else For the price they charge it wasn t worth it 
0DYtHRNygrBHENRv1kOaIQ Princeton My initial excitement about the bakery was quickly dashed after my first bite As a baked goods connoisseur I thought these cupcakes tasted as though they were made from one of about three different box mixes The unique flavors advertised seemed like just flavorings added to overly sweet institutional icing Overall a bit too dry and sweet with missed opportunities to actually flavor the cake I love the idea of the bakery it s a shame the cupcakes aren t so good 
0EAOXNkEdel26eORVQXVvg Princeton Love Lucy s they also opened a restaurant in Rocky Hill 113 I think Great sandwiches fresh pasta and sauces large selection of dishes to choose from for take out and reheat for dinner There will be a long line for the lunch crowd the line moves rather quickly and its worth the wait 
0egJXYaVL2OwOQp93ZV4WQ Princeton I was very disappointed especially after seeing the high reviews on Yelp I love going to used CD stores and have been to used CD stores all over the US If this is really one of the best places on the East Coast I m really disappointed The selection was sparse and poorly organized I guess if you don t have many CDs in inventory you don t need to alphabetize them Prices for used CDs for sale were just OK Prices for buying used CDs were ABYSMAL I won t be back 
0fbA5zI7F3H4A6t9v3iHFw Princeton Bent Spoon makes some of the best freshest most creative ice cream I ve ever had They make lots of use of local ingredients in season too Try their Jersey basil ice cream in late summer Feel free to ask for a taste of anything their scoopers are happy to oblige Do I like Thomas Sweet Yes for basic ice cream with stuff blended in Do I like Halo Pub Yes I ll admit I d probably go there instead if I had a hankering for simple chocolate or vanilla The reason Bent Spoon is my favorite is because I never know what they ll dream up next and their flavors aren t found anywhere else I ve had strawberry mascarpone creme fraiche vanilla salt caramel olive oil pear prosecco and more if you like a flavor try it now because it might not be there next time They ve made hundreds of flavors over the years Oh and as for the people arguing price Yeah they re a little pricey It s also hand crafted small batches of artisanal ice cream made with the best ingredients they can get their hands on And it s Princeton There are worse splurges than 3 50 for a small ice cream Treat yourself By the way they don t just do ice cream try the sea salt caramel brownies I know it sounds like I work for them but I don t I m just that loyal and happy a customer Bent Spoon is a don t miss stop in Princeton 
0fgd8BUJR2F2Vsqkuogxkg Princeton We love the atmosphere the great beer and good food here I love the Irish Red Ale with a burger or falafel My husband likes the lamb chops The fish in the fish and chips was a bit too battery for me The restaurant is easy to miss the first time you go but it s next to Panera which is impossible to miss 
0Fgz6nhCEoX4Z1FF55SSaA Princeton The first time I went in here it was because CVS was out of my prescription and I needed it right away they informed me that plainsboro pharmacy right across the street still had some in stock last they heard The moment I stepped in there I was helped by the pharmacist owner it turns out that my insurance needed prior authorization from my dr which is a problem I ve run into frequently with my medication so I ended up having to pay full price WOAH they were at leas 100 cheaper than CVS when I had to pay full price over there The pharmacist had my script ready in about 2 minutes after having to call my health insurance and he even gave me the number that my dr should call to have prior authorization This service and pricing was a thousand times better than I have ever experienced at any CVS From that point on I never looked back and I will continue using Plaisboro Pharmacy as long as I live nearby Futhermore the second time I went in there about a month later the owner saw my face and remembered my name right away They are the best I d highly reccommend that anyone try them out and they wont regret it 
0FVWdJLQ35dHZ9L8iWvkaQ Princeton The workers are very nice Prompt service My only negative comment is the price This is nearly NYC prices in the middle of NJ I ll be taking my business elsewhere 
0G2chAzpxNhS4jc73QadJA Princeton This is just your basic American food place with a bar It s kind of like a TGI Fridays but more expensive Covered in old skool Princeton memorabilia unique forks 3 prongs very medieval looking decent service The portions are large but even still the prices are high for such basic unremarkable food The menu isn t very exciting or exhaustive I ve never gone there because I had a craving for it I ve gone because it s convenient and slightly less expensive than the better restaurants around I ve never been there later in the night for the bar scene though 
0Ga9ioL9Gswv0d9G10Eoug Princeton Expensive place for mediocre Chinese influenced Japanese food We had dinner once at this place and be warned that this is a tale of disappointments The high point of the dinner was walking into the door and noticing the design of the space It s nicely decorated The waitress who came to take our order shortly afterwards was stone faced and slightly impatient To her defense we were ordering one entree to share which understandably can be annoying The miso soup came out after a long wait it was lukewarm and extremely bland It was like having leftover from the night before The salad followed iceberg lettuce with large slabs of ginger dressing Standard fare for cheap sushi places but here Another extremely long wait Close to 50 minutes after we arrived our entree finally came It was doused in sauce another standard thing for really cheap chinese japanese sushi joints but again here For this price 20 Overall this was a sore disappointment Everything including the food is fancily presented but tastes even less than mediocre The cooking of this place reminds me of the late Ichiban Zen where mediocre MSG doused foods rule Bottom Line You re paying for the decor nothing more 
0gbJmc5qSs46aIYKbVwD6w Princeton BEST ICECREAM OF MY LIFE Homemade light creative Worth a drive into Princeton just to taste this icecream 3 words Sweet Basil Icecream Wow 
0GIOpUtE3lQfaPF013I_Qg Princeton Delicious ice cream at a good price 
0GlKO5aVgtI8aERuIfOtjg Princeton 2 5 5 This place is incredibly expensive for incredibly mediocre food The bibimbap is okay but I ve had better Their sushi rice is very vinegary if you like that but their sushi in general is small and again just okay Anything with bulgolgi is overpriced and the meat itself is tough dry and flavorless Plus the amount of rice they give you with entrees is a travesty It s all conical shaped to be cute but it s barely a morsel and they charge you for extra Save your money there are plenty of better options on Nassau 
0glZ2eP1d_Nl3cKOKhgyGA Princeton I tried this place for the first time a couple of years ago while in town I am pretty sure I had ordered either cashew nut chicken or kung pao chicken and I remember it being good So being back in town again I ventured here with a friend for dinner We ordered the Seafood dumplings for starters These were pretty good I ordered iced tea to drink On the first sip it clearly tasted like there was some kind of soap in it I had to cancel that off my order and drink water I noticed on the menu they had Mango chicken Now back near home in Webster TX there is a restaurant called 888 Bistro that has really awesome chinese food The Mango chicken there is incredible and everything I ve tried not to mention the best crab puffs on Earth So assuming that Mango chicken may be somewhat similar here at Tiger Noodles and willing to experiment a bit I ordered it As another reviewer commented some things are apparently better than others The Mango Chicken blew goats Not even close to my beloved 888 My screaming plate of pathetic had skinny little slivers of chicken with about 10 billion hard french fry looking pieces of mango I could have built a fort with these things I ate a third grudgingly and had to stop Might be looking elsewhere for my Chinese fix next time in Princeton 
0gpmQd3RC-EvrR2n8ctdiw Princeton The owner was very sweet but she burned the out of my face on both eyebrows for my eyebrow wax My brows look great except for the giant red burns 
0hASL8-J3DelTzBxS-i9gA Princeton We really enjoyed eating at Teresa s and have made many visits There are many things to choose from but I love to get the salad pizza and a glass of wine Parking can be a challenge and it s often crowded but worth it 
0hjTRY0gAesASO76FRFFhw Princeton Tasty Great Malaysian food 
0hnuZ261HA_6Qv7NTm9cNQ Princeton try the raffaella white pizza roasted garlic mmmm mmmm good my new favorite 
0hQENXaD2WYhvQsmLydQmA Princeton Great place for Chinese food I ve been coming to this place for 3 years now and it never disappoints Very friendly and family owned Definitely a recommended spot one of my usuals 
0hx4aJh6J3cFfV3AM9Ey1w Princeton This place is overpriced and the crowd is all 20 to 30 somethings desperately searching for a good time in the middle of suburbia but I can t help it I love this place This is another example of knowing what to order Skip the high priced fancy sounding stuff and go for the sandwiches burgers and appetizers They re all incredibly tasty and the chipotle mayo that comes with the fries is to die for I almost always get the burger when I m here because it s heavenly Before I was 21 I liked this place a lot less than I do now but having happily turned 21 a couple of years ago I can finally drink here and my rating has definitely gone up The beer is unique and delicious and I love the seasonal beers The variety itself makes coming here a treat My boyfriend won t go here anymore because apparently he saw a roach crawling on the wall while he was at dinner and the management did nothing but look annoyed at him for pointing it out but until I have a bad experience I ll keep my rating as is 
0iD4qELmglvvsOjVDPBN-Q Princeton This place has degraded over time used to be reasonably sized portions and good service we came to Penang for lunch with a group of people the waitresses we FLYING by so that you couldn t even ask for a glass of water the size of dishes that were served would probably not even be enough for a 5 year old let alone too small for adults This was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT and I will definitely Not be returning back anytime soon 
0ID9-Ns77YuJztCSPctrVg Princeton Really enjoyed eating here during my years at Princeton I remember the times when I ate so much food that my friend had to carry me back home on his back I think I ate like 15 gulab jamuns after my monstrous helpings of curry Ahhh Kalluri good memories good times 
0idGxju-fYnot4yRfkodPw Princeton I really really want to like this place more than I do Despite the polished look of the place there are several specific reasons why I am only giving it two stars 1 Prices I understand that the markup on jewelry and watches is going to be huge almost everywhere but this place is on the main drag in Princeton and the prices reflect that It s unnecessary 2 I have a good friend who has been going through absolute hell with these people with regards to a special order They charged his card before they would place the order and then a misinformed salesperson charged his card AGAIN after the order was placed but before he had his merchandise Reversing that second charge was a nightmare and took MONTHS Also my friend s merchandise in this case it was multiple thousands of dollars worth of flatware took over 6 months to arrive and Hamilton was absolutely ABYSMAL about keeping my friend informed about the status of his items It turns out that the items were backordered with the manufacturer so it definitely wasn t Hamilton s fault but it WAS their fault that they never knew what was going on with the order and didn t really seem to care to put in any effort to find out 3 Snooty salespeople Both I and several of my friends have gone in here and been treated like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman The tone of the salespeople changes markedly when they realise that I am actually pretty knowledgeable about my intended purchases AND that I have the funds to pay for them I suppose this actually makes me angrier because it means that their attitude was a conscious thing directed at a customer who they perceived as being beneath them Since this place is on Nassau Street expect to park in a garage if you re unable to find a spot on the street Thankfully there are two garages close by Street spots are metered parking 
0IfXO9BZGyeCWWHdO05gkA Princeton I had a great experience ordering my Mini through Princeton Mini My salesperson Mike T was very knowledgeable about all the options and features of the car and shared feedback he had received from other Mini drivers to help sway me for or against certain options Your mileage may vary but my inquiries were taken seriously from the moment I walked in on a whim until a few weeks later when I actually placed my order and all the way through the closing process They didn t pester me with e mails or voicemails or any other BS I have experienced when car shopping The sales environment is pretty low pressure but still do your homework and know what you do and do not want on your car It s not some magical place where you walk in and get the best deal after snapping your fingers but compared to other dealership experiences it was much more straightforward Although I realize that Princeton Mini is in the business of selling cars so they obviously are working to make sure everything is going smoothly and move inventory I feel like the staff went a bit above and beyond what is normal and I really appreciated that I didn t have to be gruff and demand to be shown and walked through all the features and functions of my new vehicle it was the first thing Mike wanted to do when I arrived to finalize BEFORE talking money etc When I found a non trivial scratch in the paint work it was immediately documented in writing as a free repair The price we had discussed was the price that was presented and all their was no financial beating around the bush No one tried to rush me out the door and send me on my way but the entire process was much quicker than I thought and I began to enjoy my new ride much sooner than anticipated I have not yet had the pleasure displeasure of dealing with their service department yet but I ll update when I do 
0IHDA_l5v3llTflMMocxug Princeton Walking into this establishment you might think you ve stepped into late period Satyajit Ray but as soon as the waiter steward opens his mouth it s clear that you are in fact caught in mid period Jacques Tati The chicken makhni s pretty good but the garlic naan is a disaster you re hustling a bad shell game when you think the customer can t tell the difference between garlic and a goddamned onion Here s the moon Okay now here s sixpence The first time I came here to eat a fat white man strangely trying to impress the woman who was presumably his daughter and who was old and smart looking enough to be embarrassed yelled over to the steward Is the chef in a good mood today before emitting a sustained chortle That s odd I thought Then I read the following on chefmoz org One saturday myself and my daughter apparently different diners than above went for the buffet My daughter is 13 years old She accidentally spilled a few teaspoons of curry on the table cloth The owner the short man with turban came to our table and told us that we don t know how to eat at restaurants and we should pay to get the table cloth cleaned Isn t that reason enough to check this place out Before Chapter 11 of course 
0IoPnhUpy4YSN1lL4jBA-w Princeton Went to tortugas w a friend for dinner Thank god for the company otherwise my 40 tip spent would feel worthless A few things about this joint before i head into my review It seemed like it was BYOB Also NO CARD SO MAKE SURE U BRING CASH My friend and i had no cash so i had to walk over to the deli about 5 min away towards to hospital to grab money from the ATM not cool Chips and salsa acc to their website are NOT BOTTOMLESS The first batch is complimentary So savor the free stuff Their new location is across the street from the old location Street parking Pricey Around over 10 for an appetizer Clean bathroom 2 floors Location Off the beaten path It looks like a real estate building in a residential area Its weird and took a minute for us to realize that this was the location They need a brighter sign actually they need a sign period The restaurant name is written on the door But i guess its good for patrons who want to keep this place a secret not too much the owners Food Not bad but definitely not the best ive ever had Im not a connoisseur of mexican food by any means but NOTHING compares to Jose Tejas Even on its worst day jose tejas i think in woodbridge knocks this place out of the ballpark That being vented appropriately the food was mediocre I got the chicken fajitas They give you three tiny flour tortillas with rice guac sour cream and chicken The chicken are the size of chicken fingers they are not cut up to be served in a fajita so i had to cut it up However it was spiced pretty well i just needed to add salt The rice and beans were good but i didnt like the guac I thought the guac was over processed and dint have enough garlic my brother s guac was better than this It tasted like it came off a shelf i hope not The grilled peppers and onions were really good as well Service just okay I was seated in a heartbeat on a table for 2 While i waited about 10 minutes for my friend to arrive i wasnt rushed at all There were 2 menus chips and salsa waiting for me I tried not to eat the salsa because i read on their website that the firest batch was complementary and the 2nd was about 3 which is the LAMEST THING EVER BTW Oh yea the pico de gallo salsa was too salty for my taste But it tasted fresh Service nothing special BOTTOM LINE You lost me at no bottomless salsa chips oh dear tortugas Get ur act together Also stop being so pricey Just because u are located in Princeton doesn t mean its cool to charge 12 for guac dip that s about 6 at on the border Cost us 41 for 2 entrees 2 sodas OVERPRICED AND OVERRATED My suggestion go to on the border if ur in a rush If you are planning a mexican dinner please please head over to jose tejas they seriously are the best 
0IUEjnmTiJnCXPk21TNoAg Princeton My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary It was an older crowd for a Thursday night Very nice atmosphere for a group of friends or date The food was just OK but generally satisfying The bread was stale and served with a bean dip That was odd Menu was limited Portions were large We ordered the bruschetta to start Bruschetta is pretty easy to make however I wasn t pleased with the way it was prepared no basil Really The corn chowder was really good I ordered my steak rare as I usually do but I guess it was my mistake because it came out raw and mostly inedible for human consumption I probably wouldn t come here again since it didn t really impress me for the price 
0J8m2JNwuCMpbRaHTcYs_A Princeton I wouldn t disagree with reviewers saying this place might have the best pizza in the town of Plainsboro which is a really small town by the way We usually had a late dinner take out of medium or large pizza with chicken wings around 20 bucks total I think they are pretty good The guys working there are pretty nice too 
0jD0EHkfU84S5KMgJzBIaw Princeton Avoid Food is meh and insultingly overpriced if you are any kind of conscious thinking lover of food Service is okay but slow I hear the drinks are very strong and well made but I don t know this personally Wait times can be absolutely retarded even if you have a reservation I d rather go to the food court and eat at Teriyaki Boy no joke 
0JiqK11sA1sDx0FvQkFo_w Princeton My wife works in town so i usually meet her after work at least once a week for dinner We have been visiting La Mezzaluna for quite a while now and are very happy with their food and service Recently my wife has had some dietary restrictions imposed that limit what she can eat being a carnivore myself I never appreciated the challenges people on special diets face when going out to eat The Chef and wait staff have been very accommodating to my wife never flinching when my wife ask to dismantle one of their wonder specials As for me I am a huge fan of the pasta with fresh clams in white wine sauce it is not on the menu but they will happily prepare it for you if you ask My favorite dish home made Gnocchi with shaved Black truffles 
0l3bo3stS76PYIQtDu1Xcg Princeton great decor spacious tasty reasonably priced open late amazing i thought it s a pub with ice cream it s actually a pub which i think is so awesome when i m bored reading in my office i will definitely come hang out at halo and geek out on my laptop i think they have wifi too the only downside is that their ice cream flavors are not so inspiring though numerous the bent spoon has more creative icecream flavor but for some strange reason i still like halo better 
0l6tl6myhVg8Ten6sDbiaw Princeton About 3 miles from Nassau street and Princeton University located in a beautiful forested area it s quiet comfortable and business oriented The Barley s Pub restaurant has very good reasonably priced meals and there s a fancier restaurant adjacent that I did not try out Excellent service comfortable bedding air conditioning that works WiFi is 13 extra but on Sunday the room was a bargain 119 plus tax up to 239 for Monday Very comfortable hotel 
0lE5GDTHwBaBVj7d0Ymnqg Princeton Had good seafood here 
0LgxTBDYzpoQ7UuJdtZQrw Princeton the service was excellent the atmosphere was good enough although too dimly lit the meals were very tasty the pricing was overboard it s simply too expensive like most places in princeton does affluence make people stupid apparently these same people own the fish market that adjoins the restaurant i went in one day and got 1 swordfish steak and 1 cod fillet the guy at the counter told me my total was 48 are they smoking crack in the walk in i told him to unwrap it and put it back on display i went to the shop rite and purchased comparable i swear goods for 23 jersey fresh farm market on rt 1 south in south brunswick by the old j j plant has EXCELLENT quality fresh fish and decent prices 
0lQkDyZ_cwEHqOy1hGJRPA Princeton This puts the super in supermarkets It is the supermarket that all other supermarkets look up to This place has everything you could ever imagine Just think of something Anything Exotic cheeses Fast food chinese They have it Also the best lox imaginable Just thinking about it is making me drool on my computer 
0lwkuYPAFBFb2lIZ-Hht3A Princeton Their lunch buffet is tasty and has a good variety of dishes I like the buffet because you can try a little bit of everything The naan is very good Not the best Indian I ve ever had but certainly a decent stop for lunch when you re craving Indian food 
0lWlIQu9DmVvVkB_qyB9bw Princeton This place has a really great outdoor patio and bar the atmosphere was my favorite part Overall above average food at a reasonable price but the parmesan asparagus side dish was exceptional 
0m9PU1J1Chuu3jglBEjfFg Princeton I recently purchased a road bike from Halters Cycles I looked at many other stores and none gave me any where near the attention and service that I received at Halters Jay made sure that every component of the bike was just right for me I was VERY pleased with my experience there and would recommend this shop to anyone I know looking for a bike or bike accessories 
0mmSIFy7oHYzTbcpYKOZmw Princeton I had Tico s Signature Panini here for lunch one afternoon and enjoyed it thoroughly The steak was deliciously marinated sauteed onions were fresh and zesty and the cheddar cheese was of good quality because the flavor wasn t overbearing I ll definitely stop by again next time I m in town 
0ms6_3EsY2gUH6G3z6mmxw Princeton I adore crave and obsess over the brioche and the challah here I ve tried to expand my repertoire but I only got so far as a pumpkin loaf because challah was sold out and I couldn t walk out with only a brioche before I decided I couldn t part with my yummy eggy buttery breads Get there earlier in the day if you can the selection is much bigger and the bread is fresher Later in the afternoon they stop making the bread continuously and they usually sell out of the popular types I ve tried their sandwiches before and while good I think their fresh bread is a better bargain Seriously if you even think about going to Panera please don t and walk the extra 2 blocks to Witherspoon Bread Company you will not regret it 
0MvxmH7-BpEXEMeEhsV6QA Princeton This is the 4th place I ve tried in Princeton and I finally found a place I m happy with Meghan is GREAT You can also get 10 off if you re a Princeton student 
0n3EyqEh-RXFFTVH0T5SmQ Princeton This is the biggest Panera I have ever been in They even have a private room for events Panera s food is solid and its one my favorite chain places We were here for breakfast we arrived around 10 am and they still had a souffles I have noticed that many other locations always run out of them around 9 30ish The service was great everyone was friendly and the place was super clean Actually this was one of the best meals I ve had in Princeton over my little two day stay there 
0n7K89ftfWicp4m0pZ3hXg Princeton Just because it s a local non chain place doesn t mean it s good Bucks County Coffee Co Such garbage Luckily Small World is one of the good ones I went here a couple times a week more or less for about ten years I probably had everything I was ever going to have many many times The drip coffee and espresso here are superior to Starbucks Anything that uses chocolate powder here is just not worth even comparing to pumps at Starbucks The iced coffee here is way better lest you need a 31 ounce version The credit card thing that s just never going to change I guess I certainly never would have went to Starbucks had SW accepted credit cards But they d probably have to raise their prices to cover the processing fees if they did start taking cards Not to mention the longer lines and increased time waiting around The whole congestion thing and line flow definitely an issue sometimes In general they re just usually so crowded It s definitely super loud in here I don t know how one could study here but people do If you re in Princeton and you like coffee this is the only game in town 
0Ne-Lirvy90q6hai2kr0ww Princeton Best croissont I have ever had including in France Small but rich an absolutely delicious The best time to get them can be a bit unpredictable I am often too early not ready yet or too late sold out Cakes and other assorted pastries are all excellent 
0NFVEQIScslTrOlfupNEBw Princeton Poor service poor food poor decor and expensive I think it stays open because guests at the next door hotel come here without knowing any better 
0nhW8h3JkLJIzzqVEwN0-A Princeton New Jersey Italian Reviewing only the take out sandwiches Surprisingly good We were hungry road tripping and escaping the Turnpike via Rt 1 Pulled in here in the snow following the garish PIZZA sign to the back of the plaza across from the Home Depot It turned out to be a real restaurant in the back where folks were eating lunch but we just got sandwiches to go I had the special prosciutto with cheese and roasted red pepper and my dining partner had something more boring off the normal sub menu Both were good though mine was more flavorful They put the subs in the oven which I didn t expect not being from the area It was very New Jersey You want I should take them out no no I ll wait that s fine Ok here puts sandwich on a paper plate stuffs it in a thin paper bag You come back soon Um ok But seriously the subs were good 
0nHWIdLc-3xoiRFvSqDbYQ Princeton Princeton Garden is one of my favorite movie theaters in NJ While there are only two screens and less than comfortable seating the theatre still ranks pretty high in my book as it offers fantastic movie selections The theater opened its doors back in 1920 and is still going strong today It s located on Nassau Street across from campus The films shown are mostly independent and or foreign films leaving the blockbusters to multiplex cinemas Student ID accepted for a reduced price 
0nTpzk2LMAosG1Jq9QjgNg Princeton This place would ve been 5 stars if it weren t for the existence of the other ice cream place also in Palmer square which to me is heaven This place is great though and has unique offerings aside from regular ice cream love the little ice cream cake slices like carvel I ve cream cake on crack 
0O8BF4FH7pGu4bxZj902Ig Princeton I have been to KC Prime at least a couple dozen times over the past 10 years In my opinion I think that it is on the decline Their menu has not change much or at all in a decade and their specials never change My guess is that they had a good chef a while ago and eventually he left and they kept everything the way it was before he left My wife and I went to KC Prime last night and I was really looking forward to a good steak I ordered their cowboy aged ribeye which has been offered as a special for at least my last five visits It was not very good It was tasteless and very very tough The steak was not worth the 40 dollars that I paid My wife s meal was better but she order their apple desert and it was pretty bad She didn t even really want to eat it In summary the place is in the decline I ll think twice before returning 
0oCiwALfjBxx0GD_b74SGA Princeton I went to Brighter Dental care with a terrible toothache I found out about Brighter from the list of approved in network dental providers on my insurance company s website I came in for a x ray and they told me I needed a root canal However the receptionist couldn t figure out how to bill my insurance so they kicked me out even though I was in a lot of pain Best to avoid this dentist 
0OmL3huDBZpnXBcIzplQUg Princeton They have the best buffalo wings and fries freshcut that I have ever tasted period 
0oSgHaCHm9z_AZMCHvGBIw Princeton The service and quality of the food is going down hill What s going on Also the happy feet behind me was unpleasant on a recent visit Mentioned it to the waiter and he shrugged and went away Switched sides with Jim and 5 minutes later there was another set of happy feet Will never sit at a booth there again first set 20 s 2nd set old professor type 
0Oum_bu8F5bzYyctFJ9Vow Princeton We stopped by this Small World location while visiting friends in Princeton and although the prices made me wince they are understandable I just wish the small were a LITTLE larger for what you end up paying Still the food looked good though we didn t try any of it with adorable little red velvet cupcakes and freshly prepared salads and such The baristas were pleasant and friendly and though there was a long line almost to the door it moved along quickly It was the espresso that was the star of the show though even though I doctored it up by ordering a caramel latte I know I know It s a travesty And I don t even normally ENJOY the really sweet drinks but something about Small World hinted that it would be worth the experience and it was Unlike at larger chains the latte was really well balanced you could taste all of the espresso with just a hint of sweetness and even the milk was of appreciably good quality It was probably one of the best caramel lattes I ve ever had My boyfriend also enjoyed his coffee but he just got the Joe instead of the slow brewed variety also offered which would probably be even better Good thing I don t live in Princeton or my wallet would be a LOT thinner after daily trips here 
0p44cADDU9SkeUTCFYr0IA Princeton First visit to One 53 and we thoroughly enjoyed it Glad I made made reservations for Valentine s day dinner as clearly it was a popular choice Appetizer Salmon Tartare and main courses Yellowfin Tuna Seared Rabbit Loin were excellent Did feel that the cheese plate for dessert was way over priced for what it contained Only other detractor was that our server was not particularly friendly Look forward to another visit 
0pLM0oEjRxaSe2B67DTgmg Princeton I frequent the restaurant side of Cafe Colore every now and then The food is good and the service is fast and friendly during lunch time Today I had the lobster ravioli with mushrooms in a cream sauce I ate every last bite 
0pru5qDW8egK-9N6PrgD8A Princeton Liked the ambiance 
0pS1Z2Gm8mFIKjZwnoxRTQ Princeton Have gone back twice just for their burritos The burritos are great healthy everything is fresh and the black beans are amazing Not sure how they prepare them but they are the best I ve had I have gotten their fresh fruit smoothies too Pretty good Good service as well There is a 10 credit card limit but I have spent less than 10 and they still let me put it on the card 
0ps8jygGbGhaDf1vyIUpOw Princeton Prices are good Especially for dried goods rice beans etc Produce prices can be good but be careful about the freshness Lots of Asian snacks and excellent frozen food section lots of dumplings lots of mochi But the smell of this store is not for the weak at heart It gets especially bad in summer It s still pretty unacceptable in winter though But yeah breath through the mouth target the product pay fast go 
0Q7diiKEONgY6sAPBWuirw Princeton My fiance s friend has his Indian wedding here The food is good the ambiance especially for the reception was pretty good The service people were decent The location is pretty much in the middle of no where so there isn t much to do in the area Overall not too bad 
0QeFExyayyD25sgVPMbeBg Princeton I was Googling this spot bc my bff is meeting me there tonight and low and behold I have been here before for brunch years ago and I the only thing I can remember is that the bread they serve you prior to your meal was pretty good Oh And the decor was pretty modern That s it 
0QkzKulKzf7jdwciib9k6w Princeton Hanan Isaacs came to my rescue in mid January 2012 He listened intently and politely to my description of the situation I found myself in he offered sound and straightforward advice and he followed up by phone and e mail no fewer than four separate times over the course of the next seven days His advice was sound and well thought out his manner was sympathetic professional and authoritarian and I d consult his expertise again for any legal issue His rates are reasonable he knows what he s talking about he has a calming air about him and even thought I d never met the guy before within minutes I felt Like I d known him for years Since meeting with Hanan I ve recommended his services to a former coworker and I d do so again without the slightest hesitation When you re looking for lawyers in Princeton NJ save your time and energy and go straight to Hanan Isaacs 
0QvD9cLFo8zu4yrDPmOOXA Princeton We didn t stay here because of any planned festivities were actually going to visit a relative over the long weekend but couldn t stay at their place due to illness We ended up at this hotel mostly because it seemed to offer the most reasonable rates in a seemingly pricey area but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of our stay Not sure if anyone else has noticed this but it seems to me that a lot of the regular Holiday Inns need to upgrade their facades since quite a few of them look like they re stuck in that very plain 70 s cinderblock style from the outside Fortunately the interior seemed more inviting though it could have used some updated carpeting A nice touch was a large glass container full of fresh apples near the main entrance While the hotel was sparsely occupied we appreciated the peace and quiet We could hear voices in the hallway but not at all hours and the fan while not over loud was enough to muffle them The room was clean and comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was good Fixtures were a little beat up but clean Plenty of towels and toiletries wife was excited that they were from Bath Body Works what s that sound on the Simpsons when somebody snatches something Zoink provided and good quality coffee in room Beds and pillows were comfortable and we enjoyed a restful night The complimentary breakfast wasn t really complimentary came with an additional charge but the nightly rate was so reasonable that tacking on the breakfast charge wasn t a significant increase for us The breakfast buffet items scramble sausage bacon fruit assorted toast pastry were well prepared and hit the spot and kiddo ate for free The morning after the second night after our stay there wasn t enough demand so the buffet was suspended the hotel really was practically empty but the folks there cooked our breakfasts to order for the same price very sweet The business center had an adequate internet connection The gym had standard cardio equipment which was in good shape except for the elliptical machine which had rust on it Strength training equipment came in the form of one set of adjustable dumbbells and bench Hot tub jet spa in good order according to wife All of that said what left the most positive impression was the courteous and attentive service offered by housekeeping the front desk Shuhrat was very conscientious and friendly and server hostess Carla in the Cafe Nicole Thanks to those folks for a comfortable stay For value service and quality this hotel will be at the top of our list for consideration if we ever need accomodation when we visit again Room Tip If you don t want a room with a view of the dumpsters drive around the building once before checking in 
0QvRfPP-G3wu6s8Cy1xLjA Princeton What can I say I have been eating here EVERY SINGLE WEEKDAY for the past 4 years or so L2 Gyu Don IS the best it s not written on the menu but you can ask for a spicy version of it if you like L4 Curry Chicken very good too I get this when I get tired of L2 which is very rare L1 Beef Negimaki is something you should definitely try once when you re in the neighborhood NOTE There is an amazing dish called Curry Chicken Don that is NOT on the menu You have to ask for it 
0r0uoxG5JcOOtxjpYBO9HQ Princeton Pretty average food I suppose the only reason it really have such positive reviews is bc there is a seething of breakfast places in downtown princeton Its definitely on the higher end of prices no where near Normas but still high for what it is Just don t expect anything above diner quality 
0RLZrkoY0-4yQalPF93EkA Princeton I will always have a special place in my heart for this J Crew I used to come here once a week or so for about three months but for good reason I had a class in the same building I swear Heck I still make an effort to stop by whenever I m in town but that s probably mainly because New Jersey does not have sales tax on clothing Excellent selection large store space and friendly staff they tend to always keep things organized not crowded Downstairs women s new seasonal items Upstairs men s items and all sale items Plus the dressing room corridor upstairs actually have windows that overlook Palmer Square natural light Woohoo 
0rpIsi0tABvl2Nun5HlIfg Princeton Came here on a weekend night expecting a crowd considering the place doesn t look abnormally large It s a decent size inside but setup a little awkward with too much open space and a view right into the prep area Either way while every other place in the area was crowded no one was here typically a bad sign in my book Decent selection of food although my boyfriend and I were given menus with two different daily specials on them When we asked they said it was all special so that was a little weird I ordered the mango duck which was incredibly too sweet pretty much all mango syrup and a side of duck The boyfiend s sushi was amazing though Overall I d say just okay Probably best to stick to the sushi 
0RxzWxfWK95pbAIsSTiNng Princeton Wegmans is a real cool supermarket near Princeton They had awesome crab cakes which some buddies and I took home to cook At 8 a piece they were a little steep but they were super good Lots of crab and with a little macaroni salad on the side and some chips the dinner was amazing They had a ton of fresh seafood as well plus they have a solid liquor store off to the side We picked up some Brooklyn Brewery IPA to make the meal perfect 
0S8chSDOyY-CqIbMyAVzVQ Princeton PROS good ambience CONS average food 
0sMCVrTROS_8cNNVTzB7yw Princeton Went here for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend Atmosphere and service are great We were seated outside The food was fresh but not up to our expectations given the reviews The grilled octopus was a disappointment There was no flavor and it was just greasy tasting I am not even sure if they used the proper olive oil since it was lacking in all flavors If you want to know what good grilled octopus is supposed to taste like go to Varka restaurant in Ramsey I suggest the chefs in Princeton make a reservation Also authentic calamari is floured not breaded Overall it was a nice night but I wouldn t go here again 
0ss1AeT5fxDALD23FnrH0g Princeton Decent burger but the chili and pasta fagioli were sub par The gnocchi was drowning in a thick cream sauce The service has to be better than the dolt who drifted back and forth to our table today The vibe is a charming college town feel I wouldn t recommend this place for anything besides pancakes At least the bathroom was clean 
0sws-FV5WRTl37w-cXzvuA Princeton Their cheese slices have never disappointed The fancier ristorante which shares the kitchen also has good food 
0TGXQ2Zq2a_aiq6G78F2Zg Princeton I ve only been here on the weekend for dimsum but haven t had a chance to order off the regular menu The dimsum experience was a bit disappointing as they lacked the traditional carts being pushed around The dimsum dishes were ordered off the menu making it somewhat of a surprise game when the actual dishes came The food overall tasted decent Flavor and authenticity wise I was not too disappointed The quantities and sizes however were a bit on the meager side especially with the sesame cakes being half the size of a golf ball The soy milk was a pleasant addition to the menu but they lacked the option sticky rice as a side The staff was generally friendly but we felt rushed and they gave us the impression that we were taking too long to decide Dimsum is a several hour event Other than that the quality of the food is not bad wish there was more variety and options on the menu I may be back to try the main menu but do not have high expectations 
0TutZ7SzNive5FSFSxw7gQ Princeton Incredibly expensive fresh fish without any clear reason why They re definitely not wasting money on floor space its really difficult so shop here because the public space is so tiny We headed here on a quest for something delectable for a special dinner expecting to pay a bit more than usual but also expecting to be able to discern that we were getting something special for our extra money Even expecting to pay a lot I lost my appetite reading the price signs stuck in the ice among the fillets and steaks We headed to WF which had most of the same offerings at much lower prices and with a lot more detail about each products origins than is provided at Nassau We ended up with a gorgeous Copper River filet which tasted that much sweeter knowing it came at a fair price 
0tW697ty3aT0GjhvoilWPQ Princeton I really enjoyed our lunch here It was a reasonably priced for fine cuisine and you won t leave hungry We had the tuna tartar which was excellent Elbow Macaroni Bolognese and Marinated Lamb Sandwich All were tasty dishes and the atmosphere was very nice The other favorable reviews are spot on 
0uey1jUP7-CU-5amahQBxA Princeton Ganges is great I was somewhat tired of the places in town Princeton where one indian place takes an hour to make your food and another is just so expensive and charges extra for rice and this place is right near my chiropractor so I m passing by once a week at least We ordered a ton of stuff since we had family in visiting and that s a great way to try a place out I was a bit taken aback by the RED colour of the Chicken Tikka Masala but it was YUM The food is noticeably not greasy and all the dishes were good all of the family was happy I recommend this place to all those Princetonians who are fed up with our in town choices Ganges is better faster less greasy and cheaper 
0uMcGBzkkT1BzdnMV27HFg Princeton Fabulous wine shop and a wonderful place to hang out Careful great looking displays The store raises considerably the tone of sophistication and cool in princeton Staff very knowledgeable in an unpretentious and friendly way I m learning a lot about wine and I always meet interesting people at the tastings 
0UTGXd6-4R8v3l99TgTbrQ Princeton Why go to Grease Trucks when you can come here I have never had these types of non cold cut sandwiches before and could honestly say I am fan The sandwich combos are pretty good but pretty unhealthy After I was done I got the same uneasy feeling after finishing a hot pocket I did not find the prices to be too much considering how much you were getting 
0UUBxIM4jWiQF16CIWe4Kw Princeton This is a pretty cool hipster coffee joint It s kind of cramped but I ve always got my joe to go Coffee is solid and much more unique distinct and flat out enjoyable than national brand coffee chains Great stuff 
0uwl-XwDRz1Fl8xZIGiR9g Princeton west coast just can t do hoagies like the east actually they don t even call them hoagies i had the capicola ham salami provolone and the philly steak both were excellent i ve had the real philly steaks in philly and this one can hold its own although i like the ones in philly better you can t really eat inside so we stood outside chomping away unfortunately i won t ever be in the princeton area anytime soon maybe never i ll just pray that my son or daughter goes to princeton 
0V-Bg44QZ33mNUY2Av6ZQA Princeton I ve been here a few times The beer selection is pretty good and the prices are reasonable for Princeton I like the sandwiches and the fruit salad with goat cheese is pretty good The service has been good each time I ve been here and it has a nice ambience 
0V0lBG1uoldin0Vo-LdGCA Princeton Very bad customer service Don t even think of trying to return something as they rarely answer e mails or the phone You have to beg and or threaten to get your money back And even that doesn t alway work Not that any of that matters as the quality of their tunics has gone done down the tubes A shame really 
0VKS3IRk1ZFVt2Kf4lSzJg Princeton Loved the service Main course was tremendous Appetizer promised much but delivered unusual mix of crab meat carpaccio and arugula Fussy presentation for what seemed to be good quality food Thought drinks were overpriced given locale This is not Manhattan but they are charging Manhattan prices 
0vm6YAOIQJboCXUiAH6KSQ Princeton Some 25 years ago when I was just a budding geek the precursor ritual to an all nighter at the E Quad was to pick up a monster hoagie built to be nibbled on till morning Hoagie Haven could probably lay claim to a chunk of every engineering degree awarded at Princeton No visit back here has ever gone hoagie less and yesterday was no exception I had the large pizza cheese steak damn the cholesterol of which half was wolfed down in minutes and the other half took me dang near the rest of the day to finish Their half 3 80 is the same size as a large at any mortal sub shop while their large 6 50 is the equivalent of a party sub or fence post 
0VTEKgq9NtNGpC89nj2YRA Princeton Like Hoagie Haven another institution that survived a quarter century since I schooled here glad to report that there is still plenty of vinyl their new arrivals section is actually larger than Amoeba s their budget CD s actually has non shite I picked up the Gun Club s Fire of Love for 3 99 perhaps my only beef is their lack of 7 used records they ve had the same tired boxes their for ages Doesn t stop me from digging thru till I m bleary eyed tho 
0w6SADnIcM7-KtJD4JLepA Princeton Jeeesh tough crowd These guys butchered the Triumph Not me this place is a little bit of all right It s basically your every day brew pub experience Don t know what i mean OK if your primary goal is to sample all their beers and then some they have a sampler deal which consists of a dozen or so beers in a small portion For me i found them pretty run of the mill home brews nothing special but good One criticism i agree with is slacker staff Man these guys are sampling too much of their own product Food is also nothing extraordinary but not bad 
0WAszex9-SdWuuAqX38TKQ Princeton We go to Chuck s for the wings They are okay I consider them small and dry buy others may use the word crunchy When you don t have many other options you take what you can get 
0wF90JLYC8ygzCpL-zBMTw Princeton Let s start out with an important fact for all its affluence and sophistication Princeton has always been a lousy eating town I don t really know why New Brunswick and Somerville topped it years ago So your choices are surprisingly limited You could do a lot worse then Winberies I used to go fairly often but it had been about a decade since I d been there I was pleasantly surprised The beer list while overpriced is very good Palm Southern Tier Sierra Nevada specialties Founders and more I had a good chicken sandwich which is all you want at times Occasionally I m still chastised for having a chicken sandwich in Rio when I could have had piranha but look it s just a white fish probably like tilapia My cohorts had lobster clubs and turkey clubs The fries were pretty good Service was friendly and fairly efficient I was happy imagine Sisyphus happy That is a solid recommendation 
0wfvQOrB7a8LhRWBEp1pSQ Princeton I just wrote a review for another local ice cream shop so I figured I HAD to write a review about the BEST place around for this tasty summer treat Ah Spring is here Summer is right around the corner In fact according to ForecastFox in my Firexox browser Yeah Go Firefox the temperature here in central New Jersey should reach a whopping 92 degrees today I think I could use some ice cream And there s no better place around for ice cream than Thomas Sweet Ice Cream in Princeton NJ This place is an absolute landmark It is the Crme de la Crme no pun intended of ice cream establishments SERIOUSLY Now I m not that big of a fan of ice cream I can usually take it or leave it I usually leave it But if someone suggested to me that I go to Princeton to get a French Vanilla ice cream with Heath Bars mixed in I surely wouldn t say no The combination of flavors is oh I m simply overcome Anywho the only negative about the place is that it usually is crowded I m talking soup nazi crowded with the line going out the door and some really tense moments at the counter But just like the soup nazi s soup Thomas Sweet Ice Cream is totally worth it 
0WM5SrnNCkkrKQO-_hk2Mw Princeton Very nice posh hotel Really modern nice lounge area downstairs Always fast service and they have an automated wake up call system so you can be assured they won t forget due to human error The 24 hour gym was nice We had a huge block order for a work conference probably over 30 rooms There was some mix up not sure what all the details are where one of my co workers asked for extra rooms which it turns out had already been added to our order This somehow resulted in them resetting the keys to all our rooms so even those of us who had checked in a day early had to come back down to get new keys It was some big mix up that took a lot of time and I m still not sure whether it was our fault or theirs 
0WZiKDNDO-d3cWM2WxMgpw Princeton Larini s was able to fix my car electronics problem within a day It s probably not the cheapest place to take your car but the location for me was awesome as a Princeton student 
0X7PSw3UDrpXwWTyj3W1XQ Princeton Slice between is not Old World pizza but really good yeasty crusty dough thin enough to not be doughy thin crispy pepperoni not greasy sausage sliced like gyros not as fennel like as I prefer Fresh mozzarella basil The veggies could have been cooked longer but it was delivered in 21 minutes to our house estimate was 35 minutes The shop is owned by the same people who own Hoagie Heaven George s and caters to the same crowd hungry students It was like good pizza by the slice which is usually reheated for the customer at the counter I think there are chairs a counter in the window but it s a take away place eat on one of the benches outside Denser more heavily topped than Conte s and not as spiced Also not at all like Pizza Star which has good dough but makes Chuck E Cheese like pizza Different from Massimo s Iano s also with good crust but somehow indelible slices of pizza It s not Italian style like at Teresa s or Osteria Procaccini super thin ample sauce light hand on toppings more like NYC style not as good as John s better than any of the Ray s The guy who answered the phone was excited pleasant We ll definitely get it again 25 for a large pizza veggie with pepperoni sausage mushroom delivered before tip paid with a credit card over the phone There were no red bell peppers as stated and it could have used some garlic We also asked for a menu which they forgot but I can pick one up whenever The website is currently useless and only asks for signups but also lacks a menu 
0xHRm1gdA2bicy3jvu-rtQ Princeton Monday Morning Flower and Balloon Company provides beautiful fresh flower arrangements for every budget Their location in Princeton has a wide variety of flowers so it is easy to choose a bouquet for any occasion I receive a fresh bouquet from them weekly and I am never disappointed with the arrangement and the vases that accompany the flowers The owners Georgianne and Kevin are very friendly and professional Customer service is definitely the number one priority for them I highly recommend them 
0xjkXrwncJ3JoLbGaDl-zA Princeton hidden gem best pizza i ve ever had in the USA the only downside is that it s a small place and they dont take reservations so i guess sometimes you have to wait 
0XkQ7jw_mfDS9ioZoElOYg Princeton Elements of Asia is def one of my fav restaurants when I am home It is probably the best sushi place in town 
0Xw0PV78eslxtUkxn118vA Princeton 3 5 Good food good beer and friendly Been here twice 
0y7o5CJ8e2RQY2yzibB7fg Princeton Meh That s really all I can say about this place We went here because every review says OMGZ BESTWINGSIVEEVERHADZOMG but they weren t They re pretty standard wings kind of one note We also had a fried clam sandwich which was also pretty unremarkable BUT The place is cheap the service is good and if you re looking for a quick bite to eat this place is right up your alley 
0YdHAc_BvxbMJRrHpAiV2w Princeton Excellent pizza the best in the area I have been going to this pizzeria for almost 20 years and I have yet to find a comparable one within at least 25 miles Its appearance is nothing extraordinary it s just a plain bar with small tables However the pizza itself is extraordinary and the service is very friendly They make a wonderful thin crust pizza with a selection of toppings You can expect a wait during dinner time almost every day but any of the regulars would tell you that it is well worth it I wouldn t pay for any other pizza if I were in the central Jersey area 
0yHAQbqZDmUiGQwxQAjiEw Princeton This is a reasonable dive bar It s most singular feature is that it is within walking distance of Princeton campus The beer is cold and cheap It has a junky but useable pool table If you re looking for these features the Ivy Inn will do the job 
0yHyirCwMwfbiEts9tvkcg Princeton My search for a decent and affordable barber shop in Princeton will go on This place is overpriced 29 for a 10 minute haircut the guy has no concept of customer service and the haircut was pretty mediocre No styling at the end no straight razor on the neck in fact nothing out of the ordinary For 29 bucks I expect a few extras All in all a ripoff Avoid at all costs 
0YJKvQsCkwN0m1xIqHHVyg Princeton Some of the best ice cream I ve ever had I can definitely say I ve had at the Bent Spoon My husband and I took a day trip to Princeton this past weekend and the weather was just beautiful We ve heard a lot of good things about the Bent Spoon and we both love ice cream so we decided to stop in Due to the beautiful weather there was already a line out the door Of course this is also due to the fact that the inside of this place is pretty tiny but the small wait was worth it I like the fact that the ingredients are high quality and the flavors are unique and always changing When we were there they had turkish coffee lavender marscapone cashew dark chocolate and creme fraiche to name a few I found it really difficult to decide on what I wanted but I noticed an espresso shake on the menu and that seemed to call my name The guy at the counter asked me what flavor I wanted in the espresso shake and I said hmm that s a good question what would you recommend He suggested chocolate and that was definitely a good call The shake was so good Just the right consistency not too thick not too thin and flavor with the chocolate being the main flavor and the espresso accenting it nicely My husband got a blood orange sorbet and wow that was on point Very prominent blood orange flavor and just all around great quality Yes the prices are a bit higher than your regular ice cream shop but this isn t your regular ice cream shop I suggest that if you are in the area and you like ice cream or sorbet you d be doing yourself a disservice if you did not stop in at the Bent Spoon Give it a try I m sure you won t be disappointed 
0YUEcScel5_OLqdBQEra4g Princeton I always order delivery from Sultan Wok though I ve never actually been there Here s a few key pointers Takes at least 40 minutes for them to prepare and deliver your order meh Minimum 8 delivery charge 15 for credit cards Cheap lunch menu makes me feel like I hit the lotto They have their own car hehe Crispy noodles are pretty stale disappointing The wontons in the soup are GIGANTIC Holy cannoli They did let me substitute my egg roll for a spring roll I wouldn t get sushi from here it s more unauthentic than normal Pad thai is my favorite here Overall it s pretty darn good 
0z5iFEwhbVyDa-JBrPU2QA Princeton To me there is nothing more fun than trying a new restaurant and since I am a fan of Bobby Flay we had to try this new place which opened recently I am always silently inspecting eating establishments and this one looked nice and clean and I was pleased to see that everyone in the kitchen was wearing a nice head covering We ate at about 4 45 PM and there were plenty of available seats Ordering did not take too long and we both had the turkey burger called the L A Burger The avocado relish was very tasty and fresh and we also enjoyed the watercress which sat atop the burger We shared delicious sweet potato fries and were both very happy The only thing we could have wished for was a nice whole wheat bun That would have been a nice touch The music was raucus and much too loud but at a burger place I guess that is what one must expect All in all we enjoyed the meal and look forward to returning for more nice fresh delicious well cooked food 
0ZfGaClarknp17iqJwU_Iw Princeton Lululemon was brought to my awareness by a bike riding enthusiast friend of mine who swore up and down by their tops and bottoms for physical acitvities I ve never been a person who wants to pay more than 20 bucks on stuff I m going to get sweaty in and at that time they were only opened in NYC Now they are open in a great location on Nassau St in Princeton I still have not paid more than 40 bucks for any sort of work out gear but said friend gave my a GC for Christmas so I m looking forward to putting that towards a pair of their crazy awesome leggings for yoga and outdoor running I ve purchase only little items there but as little as the purchase the staff is always friendly They also give your purchase in awesome reusable totes that are great for toting lunch or groceries Each store also focuses on a lot of local outdoor physical activities so on their board table by the door there are plenty of maps business cards and information on all the fun stuff to do in the Princeton area and there are a lot Which brings me to my FAVORITE thing about Lululemon their free Sunday morning yoga sessions My best friend and I make it a point to go every Sunday and we ve discovered a love for yoga through each practice Like the previous reviewer said get there a little early to secure your spot as the place will fill up fast Each week is taught by a local instructor so it s cool because you get exposed to all different ways of instruction and it s a good opportunity if you re looking to attend a class on the regular many of the instructors are from Yoga Above on Nassau or the Princeton Yoga Center on 508 or CanDo fitness at Forrestral They ll often have their class schedules available after class I ve only had one week where I wasn t in love with the instructor but it was free so it was fine 
0zGpYtKFRt8mKisbhBON-Q Princeton If you ever need a haircut go to Pam Pam is magical Since moving to Chicago from Bucks County I ve tried several other hairstylists but none have matched up to Pam So rather than keep rolling the dice hoping for someone to give me a great cut I ve stuck with Pam Yes call me crazy but I only get my hair cut while I m home visiting my family It s not too bad since I visit several times a year but still That attests to how fabulous she is I ve gotten my hair cut all types of ways short short bob trim and all have been great They way you know a good hairstylist is how your hair looks in between haircuts not just right after Pam gives you a cut that you can grow into without any awkward stages A haircut with Pam runs about 70 but it s worth it 
0_tUsFe2EbsBp3_gdyobnw Princeton 10 degrees outside and in need of some comfort Asian food I found Shanghai Park in the area of course on yelp While I had learned to eat soupy dumplings a k a pork buns on the English menu since despite my half Chinese background I can t read the Chinese one at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia CA I had extremely high expectations for Shanghai Park s For 5 95 you get an order of 6 dumplings we opted for 2 The sauce that comes with it is similar to that of soy sauce with vinegar and strips of ginger Our buns weren t that hot when it came out and even when you take a small bite of the steam no steam would arise before sipping out the soup slightly disappointing Also ordered their singapore style noodles also lukewarm and the taste was really nothing special I hear that they have dim sum here on weekends too and I ve been looking for a place to have that in close proximity so I m glad to hear that I ve been trekking to edison and nyc Expect an upcoming update review on their dim sum soon 
10DFkUg4PSv2Mq_T0lym6A Princeton Best value for sushi in Princeton This is where I go when I get hit with that sushi craving but don t feel like breaking the bank They have a casual atmosphere with a TV and high tables You can tell that it s a very community oriented place where the owners remember their customers and are always joking around with them I love the sushi here because they are not cheap with the fish Sometimes if they have extra fish they couldn t fit in the roll they will just lay it out on top of the roll for you Their spicy tuna is much better than at other places I ve tried because they fill it with big chunks of tuna like tartare Although their salad bar is nothing fancy read iceberg lettuce the ginger dressing is SO tasty I always have to get a salad when I come here I think you can get a free salad with every two rolls you order 
10sBiSBbFgFNJIpq0tE-bg Princeton Finally a great space location and food in Princeton Been over a year since we went but I recall apps salads were strangely presented and fresh Can t wait to go back Went back in Jan Sat at the bar and had appetizers Configuration of the bar is great for socializing and meeting our neighbors we rarely see 
10V9mmrcQSy2ApC1Bx8Sgg Princeton Gross Overpriced nasty food and generally apathetic service but hey I d be apathetic if I worked there too If you re really into seafood go someplace else 
11CyrZHLNA4WUC0IquRIYg Princeton Eno Terra is clearly attempting to be a fine restaurant in the Manhattan style It has many excellent points including an excellent wine selection but is a bit overpriced and overall falls short of my expectations I ll start with food My wife and I were celebrating and we each ordered three appetizers or appetizer sized entrees putting appetizer sized entrees on the menu is a plus Our overall reaction was inconsistent Her carpaccio and my tuna tartar were both overwhelmed by the pickled vegetables Her local summer vegetable rissotto was her favorite course but note that the veggies were not IN the risotto they were placed on top A small point but important to risotto fanatics The risotto itself was very nicely done not easy to do My stuffed calamari was spicy and a complex mix of flavors but black olive tapenade was a bit too strong in the mix And the calamari was chewy Perhaps this is a preference but when you ve had melt in your mouth calamari it becomes the standard Final course was a squid squid ink pasta for my wife which she liked a lot Mine was the agnolotti with coppa stuffing This was exceptional The pasta is made fresh and is lucious The coppa filling was complex and satisfying Drenched in oil with pea tendrils on top Magnificent Service was not so great To us the first and potentially most important service check off is that our drinks arrive fast and before our first course The food delivery was so fast it felt rushed which suggests the crass American habit of maximizing table turns We asked several times for the wine and it finally arrived was good but I was upset by then This is a wine restaurant And we sat in the wine bar So pairing wine by the glass with a course shouldn t be hard to do But once again the new selection of wine for the 2nd course arrived well after the food Two strikes The wine portions were generous so we didn t each do pairings for the final course The menu emphasizes locally grown and raised food They even have their own farm The waiter was a bit too chatty and not confident in wine recommendations She recommended discussing wine pairings with one of the owners and we said yes but he never showed up She also told us how wonderful everything was which I find to be a negative Let me come to my own conclusions about the food Yes you can make a recommendation if I ask but don t gush about everything The space is very attractive The wine displays are very nice The bar is nice sized and there are hi tops and a variety of tables The space is bright and older people who have trouble in noisy rooms might find the main dining room a bit too bright There are separate menus for the dining rooms and the wine bar NOTE that in the wine bar you can order from EITHER menu but in the dining room you CANNOT order from the more casual wine bar menu Seems arbitrary and capricious to me We were given the dining room menu in the wine bar and had to ASK for the wine bar menu I knew they offered both because I discussed this during a reservation call and have eaten at several NYC restaurants with two rooms and two menus I can t really comment on the quality of the wine I don t really have an experienced or intuitive wine palate But the selection was large and the prices went from reasonable to expensive Come to your own conclusions They offer free valet parking which gives the place a high class or resort feel So overall we felt rushed the food ranged from ok to excellent it was fairly expensive the service was barely ok and they made too many mistakes But it was worth the visit I would recommend it without hesitation if you love wine if you re concerned about value for the dollar do lunch and go if you want some new flavors but are willing to take a risk that they won t work and can t easily get into NYC 
11MD9aHl2ovBsLraaFbMPg Princeton The staff in this store are knowledgeable friendly and not pushy at all Selection is pretty good for clothes shoes and accessories The staff look at the way you walk to make recommendations for shoes They also have a treadmill to try the shoes Prices are average for specialty running stores 
12qe4wFB1ajB-Aooy0OFeA Princeton Best service ever Came here rather stressed during a rare lunch break but left in a much better mood thanks mostly to the smiling helpful staff Plus the clearance section is wonderful You can t beat getting a down puffer for 99 
13MYCbw0KWF2DmIC4uueig Princeton These people seem quite professional and nice enough But as a vet hospital I m not sure how competent they are They do push for all kinds of tests and vaccinations which most other vets consider unnecessary The way they push for all these things reminds me more of Banfield no offense intended toward Banfield and doesn t give me a whole lot of confidence And it s crazy that whenever we take our dog in for a vaccination it ends up costing us in the upwards of 400 500 I always end up staring at the receipt wondering if there were any mistakes So yes it s a nice looking place with nice smiling people inside And for this you pay an arm and a leg Unfortunately I m completely out of my arms and legs so I ll take my business elsewhere especially considering that this place hasn t given me any reason to think that they re better than other vet hospitals around here 
14a5ufWczhShZ_M-bqMkuA Princeton Definitely not one of my top choices for my shopping in the area The stores are ok and its not too big which makes shopping a little easier Not the greatest selection of stores It has the basics like Macy s JCPenney Sears and Lord Taylor I have never found the staff at the majority of these stores particularly all that friendly or helpful The mall itself is usually relatively clean and the upkeep is decent but it could certainly be better I usually decide to head over to the freehold mall or even bridgewater commons despite the drive for any major shopping 
14KGVUgupT1cEsGrg-F9RQ Princeton Teresa s is a fun bistro It has an energy to it maybe its the tight quarters and the college town atmosphere but it is a fun place for dinner The pizza we had was tasty as were the sausage and beef meatballs Many of the dishes are organic vegetables or farm raised animals which is something you don t often see at these prices There is a long wait on weekends so be prepared However there doesn t seem to ever be a wait at the bar if that is an option 
14LntmIq-Q2hwwQ1N_Q-TQ Princeton Best vegetarian selection One of the finest places to socialize and just love the atmosphere and friendly A must and highly recommended Mexican Restuarant 
14O6_Z6dWhleNIRVXEnhKQ Princeton I can t believe this is the first review of The Dinky Train Two cars long The Dinky takes you from Princeton Junction to Princeton University Just one stop Takes all of 5 minutes The fare is 2 25 if you buy a ticket from the machine 7 25 on board Not knowing this I get on The Dinky with 6 and a 100 bill The really sweet conductor told me to buy a 2 25 ticket from the machine when we arrived and bring it back What a nice older gentleman SF Muni drivers please take note 
14YH89qucxXNTtVPXQowXA Princeton They are mostly famed for their plethora of decently prepared lunch items hot cold that seem to be popular for the I want to eat healthier but I don t have the time to cook myself set But as a health food store I find them to be a huge fail It used to be that they were 1 higher on 5 items but now they are up to 1 higher on 2 items not acceptable in my book Add that to often finding expired items on the shelves and in the refrigerated section as well as consistently being given an attitude when using coupons this place is not for me 
14YZEpAXF98wlApoEkVvQA Princeton The food was amazing My wife says it was the best lobster bisque she s ever had better than the soup she got at McCormick and Smicks a few weeks ago The service was fair and that is pulling the rating down Are they not allowed to pour our wine for us at a BYOB never had to pour my own first glass at any restaurant The fish was beautifully grilled and tasted fantastic 
15Nhs15_c-kKRU9f16jJ1g Princeton Came here for the first time for a friend s birthday last week Food was delicious and for 21 95 worth every penny especially because they let you order SASHIMI I feel like a lot of all you can eat sushi places don t have that option Also their rolls were pretty good especially the butterfly roll Also get the ones with mango don t remember what they re called hahh Minus a star because it was cramped and service was pretty awful 
15ZAtDCwRuikiq0KCbIoEA Princeton Rocky Hill Automotive is now closed Hopefully they can open up again in a more visible location 
16yC1T1FM0UEk5WaGM-Y3A Princeton This store has a good selection of freshwater fish There do not sell any saltwater fish at this store There is a limited selection of freshwater plants The only invertebrates I saw were ghost shrimp The fish staff is very helpful though very slow during busy times There is a 14 day warranty on the fish The fish delivery is on Thursday so Fridays seem to have the best selection of fish 
17b9xXAYVJbf0cnykeGHUg Princeton I m a long time fan of Steak Hoagie The Buffalo Chicken Cheese Steak is the best you ll ever have However I have noticed the cooks are starting to skimp on the meat nowadays and the prices are rising In 2001 I would ve given this place Five stars 
185ASAh8yeBKmNUxju3tGg Princeton I stayed here this past weekend for a friends wedding Very nice hotel the room I had on the 4th floor was spacious Nice bar area downstairs they even had Sams Oktoberfest on tap so that made my stay even better I know hotels charge a lot for food and for small things at the gift shop but this place took it to another level A pack of gum was 2 50 friend calamari was 14 the one thing that was priced correctly was BEER 
18fZxKLjG9bDaKpP9y2EUQ Princeton Located a bit out of the way all the way down Witherspoon close to Princeton Medical Center is this tiny Chinese Malaysian restaurant that surprisingly serves up some of the best Chinese fare in downtown Princeton By best of course in the context of Princeton and its abhorrent lack of good Chinese restaurants I mean good If only Hunan was more centrally located on Nassau St I m sure this place would be buzzing To be honest I think the only reasons why Ivy Garden and Tiger Noodles still exist is because of its proximity to the Equad where the largely international engineering graduate students don t have meal plans and need to find places to eat every day I know this because every day the smell of bad Chinese food wafts through the building around lunchtime I digress Hunan s food is consistently good with few aberrations or atrocities All of the stir fried noodles both on the Chinese and Malaysian menu are pretty decent and I almost always order the eggplant and tofu in special sauce dish But warning Stay away from the pho Even if it s 20 degrees outside and all you want in life is a hot bowl of something True it s only 6 for a giant bowl but it was incredibly bland and slightly offensive in taste The mooshu pork was not my idea to order this was quite salty and the XO sauce that came with it was umm not XO sauce Whatever it was I didn t use it after my first wrap because it just accentuated the saltiness I ve taste tested most of the menu though and in general if you don t try to go for something wacky you ll be alright 
18H17pJeHeIKRHHsU8qg0w Princeton Not sure why this is listed as not being good for kids We took our three little ones for lunch and were surprised delighted to find high chairs and a suitable kids menu The grown up grilled cheese with Brie figs and tomato was delicious We were in from out of town but would definitely go back some day 
18pRCC6x6V7wLz4GknWPxg Princeton I lived in close to and worked at Princeton for seven years In the last two this excellent pastry shop opened up and made Princeton a bit more bearable There are now three good bakeries in Princeton within walking distance of the university Witherspoon Bakery is good for its sandwiches tuna provencal and bread but when it comes to cakes Chez Alice was the authority for many years until this Haitian pastry chef who got his start in New York City way back when broke off from Chez Alice to start his own little pastry shop You ll often find him working on his own You ll have to order a cake a day in advance if you want a particular one otherwise he ll have one or two in store that he makes that day The eclairs are to die for He serves Lavazza coffee The baked goods in the morning are excellent The cakes as I said are to die for I love the Triplets triple mousse the tiramisu and the cassis cakes but really they are all very very delicious The prices are usually the same as Chez Alice I prefer The Little Chef because it is a very small operation and everything tastes a tad bit fresher and better This is a simple no frills kind of cake shop and bakery without the sandwiches and salads that all other bakeries in Princeton seem to be infested with If you visit The Little Chef make sure to check out the largest used record cd dvd store in NJ on the same street Princeton Record Exchange where the prices are not as low as you d like but the selection is always good and if you want to try a very local coffee taste instead of Lavazza check out Small World Coffee on Witherspoon Street 
18yRidrpNmhBiutvbCLtFA Princeton Went to Elements for lunch to celebrate a birthday They had a fairly simple menu priced at 11 per course very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber From the first bite I could tell the food was prepared with fresher ingredients The roasted beets salad and the fluke were prepared beautifully and tasted even better My wife had the Peterson s burger which looked like a slider on steroids The service was very good the decor is lovely and the ambiance other than the cheesy muzak being piped throughout the restaurant was perfect for an intimate lunch Overall I would rate my experience at Elements between 4 5 and 5 stars so I ll give them the benefit of rounding up For a true foodie not a better lunch choice in the Princeton area 
19CpXVRL0OeQPSj5zl2YyA Princeton It is a Princeton institution and definitely a good place to go when you need something quick to grab I often go when I need to take something back to my desk to eat and don t have a lot of time The food is always good but rarely am I wowed and I always end up spending a lot more than I planned as they are quite pricey Service is always excellent and they will customize your order for you 
19E91WDcYYpv-PgB65I-TA Princeton I go here because it s cheaper than Whole Foods and cleaner than Shop Rite Lines are usually pretty long Sweet potatoes are the only thing I eat that Wegmans doesn t carry They have a sizable organic natural section All in all not worth the ridiculous praised heaped on it but where I usually shop It s just a grocery store 
19IS2cU3R0lxmIpeHdSbGw Princeton My favorite restaurant in Princeton Their calamari is fantastic It s a really interesting mix of squid golden raisins pine nuts hearts of celery peperoncino and plum tomatoes I was expecting it to be fried I obviously did not take the time to read its menu description more carefully but I was still pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was I had the Conchiglie Balsalmico pasta as my entr e which was just as amazing There s something about the combination of balsamic and cream that just makes your mouth water 
19w7dWpRR6b6rzZ3zOxjRg Princeton The original store is based out of downtown Princeton This one is closer to the suburbs so they increased the price on everything The food is not too bad but you feel a little ripped off at the end 
1A2TCPIErLUeCYPMwsqjRQ Princeton Came here for some lunch The grounds are spectacular I can see why people come here to study and learn super esoteric things like if a neutron gets it on with a proton maybe they ll let me apply with such similes like that But seriously enter the area and you ll just feel smarter or really really stupid But let s get to the important part the cafeteria The lunch here was insane for a cafeteria style place The pork chop I was given looked like it was made in a real restaurant The variety was quite fantastic sandwiches soups desserts etc I m not sure about the price though my boss paid I would say it wasn t that much At least I hope so Hey why don t you go pay and tell me how much it was Gracias 
1aoo6pnViNkJu3LM9r0tdA Princeton I really love Asian Bistro It s great quality food and good for it s price especially because food around Princeton is SO expensive One of the best deals you can get is the 11 99 two halves meal where you can choose two dishes you get appetizers It s a great deal for those who love variety I ended up getting the General Tso s Chicken and drunken noodles both which were delicious My friend got bulgogi so good as usual and japchae The fried eggroll was not as good so I d sugest getting the steamed dumplings Staff is really friendly If you are a student you get 10 If you tweet about them you get a free drink It s a great deal Definitely coming back There s a great variety of food AND ALSO the website looks amazing O_O 
1aoW6LTFftziOUHD_dixJQ Princeton Great service Got to meet the owner and had a great time Would recommend coming to this place 
1bLSJlViF_p8wjzf-s8g1g Princeton Great atmosphere Cozy bar area Great garlic fries 
1BRsn8knF3wCgmdzM7-EbA Princeton The pizza itself is 3 stars but let me explain this scathing review I decided to get a delivery for a pizza during lunch on relatively unbusy day I called in and told them my address The delivery guy had problems finding my address so I called him and tried guiding him through street by street Instead of listening to me he insisted that he would keep following the numbers which were out of order as I kept telling him and hung up on me I called him back trying to reexplain that the numbers on my street are out of order and he yelled at me and said he only had a certain amount of minutes on his cell phone Thirty minutes later no pizza I called back and he eventually found my house and shoved the pizza in my hands and said something like Stupid people don t know where you live I went to Magma Pizza sometime later that week and spoke to the manager who didn t offer any apology or explanation I ll never ever ever go back there again My biggest problems with this situation are 1 If you re a delivery man you should always have communication available with your customers in case of a problem as such You should not yell at your customer and tell them you only have a limited amount of minutes If you cannot use your cell phone to communicate with your customers as a delivery man you should not be delivering food on the go 2 If you re a delivery man you always treat the customer with respect no matter the situation This specific delivery guy needs a lesson in customer service and flat out integrity I wasn t even rude to him and he treated me with such disregard His behavior just shows what kind of an individual he is and that Magma Pizza hires workers with his character is disconcerting 3 The manager did nothing to remedy the situation He did not apologize or explain his employee s actions He virtually ignored us and then went on to put a pizza in the oven The stupid volcano oven Speaking of which it s not even that special And even though their pizza is actually perfectly fine Nomad and Old World and even Red Moon if I m in the mood for a greasier chunkier slice TRUMP Magma any day ALSO THE PIZZA WAS COLD WHEN IT GOT TO MY HOUSE AFTER THAT DEBACLE COLD PIZZA UGH 
1cR4wBtCbqaebqqA6ivfsg Princeton Good but nothing special Inside is very boring out dated I felt like I was in a Knight s of Columbus hall or something Prices are good 
1CxKOhiH0l8jje0uitCuaA Princeton Bagels are good yes But I get the feeling that a lot of the reviewers here have either been eating really bad bagels their whole lives and stumbled upon some decent ones finally and are thereby glorifying them or I must have been eating somewhere else Many places in Mercer County offer bagels JUST like these and in some cases do it WAY better You guys need to spread your bagel wings and fly some Onion and herb cream cheese IS way killer I will give them that much 
1d6p562lUtXypyl36DGeVQ Princeton Visited April 2009 I stayed at the Nassau Inn across the street from Teresa On a whim because I couldn t really decide on what to eat we went to Teresa s I ordered the Minestrone soup and a cheese pizza pie My boyfriend ordered the pasta integrale EVERYTHING tasted delicious Maybe its just something about Princeton but I love everything about it 
1dc2URY-vxE_IYeHzA9s_A Princeton Great for lunch Had the lump crab cakes with Shitake mushrooms Sauce was extremely good Relative to the quality of food the price is quite reasonable 
1dO8SYXU8N-JnOhx8piTZA Princeton If you aren t willing to spend go to the sale racks Usually you can find good stuff But if you re set on something get it before it s gone or come back often to check the price things go fast if they re pretty 
1dVm4xzFb2svrpS0jWHjZg Princeton 2 10 a slice but amazing pizza the cheese was great It def has the brick oven pizza feel with the crispy to perfection think crust you can eat without it falling apart and high quality ingredients The people are super nice here too 
1EC-d8TTNBe_DOrLxbcyEA Princeton How do you pick a fight with a runner Tell them they need to take a break from running But tis was my reality back on a cold February morning when I found msyelf sitting at Princeton Orthopedics with Dr Stacey Miller Smith delivering the news She s kind warm and listens to the patient She is empathetic and has an honest concern for her patient not always standard care in health services They have MRIs gym rehab services onsite and all appointments were scheduled within days of each other The back office folks billing medical records have always been prompt with requests I was ultimately referred to phyisical therapy but Dr Miller Smith continues to follow up about my progress When I was down and out about my aches and pains Dr Miller Smith and the staff at Princeton Orthopedic made me feel a lot better 
1Emgl7fWSkoT6O2J0Q1n7g Princeton Just had dinner there tonight My friend and I were looking for a relatively affordable restaurant for dinner and settled on this since i had hear great things from another friend Great decision We were promptly seated though there was not enough parking in the lot so we had to park in another nearby store s parking lot though the good service ended there Service was extremely slow and our waiter had a bit of an attitude Thankfully the food was so delicious it more than made up for the bad service I ordered the chicken parmesan with fresh pasta from local fave Lucy s ravioli kitchen It was A mazing just what I needed for the night After dinner we also ordered the chocolate bread pudding It was pretty good I can t rave about it as some others on here have but it was satisfying enough I guess the downfall for me personally was that the chocolate was a little too bitter for my taste and the pudding was a little too dry and not moist enough But delicious nonetheless I will definitely be going back 
1Eo1frlkpAsiNLXxJs1V4g Princeton While the flowers were ok nice the customer service was surprisingly not especially given the previous reviews It took about 10 minutes for me to get assistance even though the store was empty The employee owner had been distracted in a casual conversation with another staff member So when I finally asked for help she appeared as if I had rudely interrupted her conversation Despite the fact that shops should try their best to cater to customers her approach that day did not seem to value that The transaction would have been much more positive had she been even a tad friendly especially since I spent almost 50 in flowers in her shop I was tempted for a moment to not complete the transaction with her but decided it wasn t worth it after all the time I had spent there Plus I try to be cordial with folks in the service industry since I try to always support local businesses However this local business will be one I won t return to again 
1F2ooNIHrat5MuwdYaZRHg Princeton Good fries great fried calamari and great place to kick it What I like about the service here is that the waiters aren t pushy or intrusive even on a busy night 
1F8emYyPMYthRt_NbXX9aA Princeton Last night I tried Soonja s for the first time since the early 1990 s when I was in middle school and came here with my parents I hear it s changed owners since then and as far as I can tell they re doing well My two dining companions and I were eating a quick dinner before catching an 8 o clock show at McCarter Theater which might have had something to do with the packed restaurant early on a Wednesday evening Of us three I was the only one who ordered a Korean meal the seafood bim bim bop and I was very pleased with my choice It was a perfect portion the vegetable and seafood were very fresh and the rice was appropriately steaming hot The spicy sauce that came on the side gave it a nice kick as well The service was also friendly and prompt I look forward to returning again before another twenty years passes 
1Fcj-kea352y0B-FR5HCYA Princeton Ah My friends and I had lunch at this place a lot Seriously I always ended up having spicy pork which I think is the best dish they offer I also like their spicy rice cake Since they at least knew that we were regular we usually got extra kimchi they officially charge for extra for free I think I ve enjoyed eating lunch or dinner here Still I am giving only 3 stars because I heard that kitchen is not that clean from people who used to work there I had no problem from that numerous visits so maybe I m too worried 
1fEjXm9jzILRvqskGP5f2w Princeton My boyfriend and I have eaten here many times and their food is very good Last night we had a reservation for 8 00 but were not seated until 8 30 Five minutes later we ordered our appetizer and did not receive any food until 9 15 By that time we were starving and fairly angry as clients to our left and right who had arrived after us were already being served We were the invisible diners completely ignored by the staff Finally I asked what happened and our waiter said The sushi bar is backed up I looked over and found no one sitting there We are in no hurry to return after being treated so shabbily 
1Fh23_ow2ZVwIltZtolfjA Princeton I would give this place a 3 5 IF there was any other decent place around for middle eastern food but none exists So based on what I had tonight for dinner I ll gladly go back I got a shish kebab sandwich which was quite decent and a rice pudding which was delicious like really really good Other menu items were a bit overpriced but no too much Sandwiches are mostly 8 for their large size which was quite big The entree s were in the 15 20 range and the salads are typically 7 I was surprised that I couldn t have my dinner sandwich there as apparently sandwiches are only available for dine in before 4 PM so I had to take out Still good food Warning no discover plan to bring your visa or mastercard 
1fKuh2nxPJvob8Op-k2XqQ Princeton i ordered this for delivery to princeton for an event and the pizza got here 45 minutes late but to be fair princeton is dark and buildings are not labelled other than that the pizza was alright nothing special really it costs 12 18 pie depending on what toppings go on it i think it is little overpriced for what it is 
1fL-ykzhzk9NFOFGznyLxA Princeton This review is from this april Woops lol But Wow This place was beautiful and awesome and just pretty much mind blowing There was Free dinner every night which was delicious every time And there was beer and wine with dinner too Freaking awesome There was a full kitchen and they even provided Popcorn in the room I loved this place and can NOT wait to go back 
1fNNWgYSPU0EbcUnTFoe2g Princeton I have never written a review but use yelp frequently I would give Can Do Fitness negative stars if that was a possibility They have the worst customer service and management that I have ever experienced It got so bad that I emailed the CEO email address was listed on the website I never received a response PLEASE don t pretend to have good customer service by appearing to have management accessible to the public if you are never going to respond 
1FT-I0yotMBF_dlCIqKT_A Princeton I love the bread here but as someone who does things last minute it bothers me that they close 5 10 minutes early on a regular basis If you happen to show up 5 minutes before closing time the door is likely to be locked and if it s open they ve cleared the shelves and will serve you only with great reluctance So customers show up a little early Witherspoon Bread Company please go by the hours you advertise 
1FUQZbmlkg0sIN5BAn6qZw Princeton Most importantly this is the best coffee shop pretty much anywhere 1 star because the prices are damn near inane it s like 3 bucks for a cookie But just being in here makes you feel good love it 
1FZZsUfd4OnKop3oauk8Iw Princeton Wow What a sandwich This place rivals Ike s in the Castro district in San Francisco with the crazy ingredient combos and melt in your mouth bread except it s cheaper and decidedly more spacious I opted for the Mac Daddy and thanks to other Yelpers only ordered the half size Just enough to leave me full without feeling disgusting Yeah This place isn t for you if you re counting points watching your waist or minding your calories But DAMN it s a nice indulgence Next time I m in Princeton I ll definitely be back 
1G9wWVQx85Veuhif_yggLg Princeton I don t know who said this was like NY pizza Uh no way It was bland and tasteless They use fresh mozzarella slices which is great if you want gourmet pizza but it doesn t give you the real cheese to sauce ratio that a great pizza offers We ordered a whole large pizza so it was made to order But sadly it was very disappointing Also they ONLY take cash What s the deal Princeton Very tiny place with seating for three and a surly manager whose unhappiness comes out in the pizza I say pass I found a better though seemingly highly unlikely place a week later called Candela II in a little strip mall behind Quaker Bridge Road It s in the same place as the Dunkin Donuts This was NYC pizza 
1GDkLYKgurG__AoPSAWgpA Princeton Excellent coffee and pastries Teeming with professors post docs and strollers the Small World location on Nassau St lets you sip your lattes in a markedly calmer and older atmosphere than the original location on Witherspoon Don t plan to spend the day here though as seating is limited and there may not be a place for your laptop 
1Grg2sYtNm4OuQLegGew_g Princeton It is what it is If you like this kind of place you ll love the Ivy If you don t you won t like it 1000 better since the NJ smoking ban I would really give this place a 4 but I m giving it a 5 to counteract the moron who rated the bar badly because he was dumb enough to drink and drive The very nice bartenders will gladly call you a cab I m sure 
1Gwa1-wm6FB3ZoZgR3COnQ Princeton Awesome food The reasons why I am not giving this 5 stars is due to its service Waited 45 minutes for our spring rolls but once the food came wow 
1h08zykYRwjZAaubwQsLZw Princeton I stayed two nights for a work related training event I just wish that I would have known that there was an indoor pool Dang The meals were buffet style and plentiful The staff was nice I was impressed with one particular staff member that carried my heavy overloaded bag I always over pack you go She Ra The hotel provided a mid day snack and beverage spread that was remarkable The lay out of the hotel was nice the grounds were pretty and it was nice and quiet 
1h1NEqYav3eiOpKxlsW_Pg Princeton Triumph is a lot of fun The beer is really good they have an IPA I m in love with and lots of other brews to fit every taste The food is good the beer is better Though they do have a hanger steak entree that I really do like a lot But definitely the best beer in Princeton 
1h2KsMowNW_B0hMHZjsWGw Princeton This place is chock full of incredibly delicious things Almost everything I ve tried here from the tilapia to the pasta to the vegetable sides to the desserts has been delicious Even very simple dishes like pasta with olive oil and garbanzo beans is delicate flavorful and perfectly textured In the fridge at the back of the shop are ready to go takeout items including salads sandwiches pasta fruit and desserts There is a selection of homemade pasta and sauces And then two cases filled with meats pasta salads lasagna veggies and side dishes For selection and flavor I d give it five stars I m taking off one because it s pricey It s hard to go in within spending at least 20 30 This is a great place to pick up a ready made meal when you don t have time or to stock up for a picnic 
1HR4wDIPGg_bv038FA7T7Q Princeton We went to this place as this waitress standing outside was offering free croquettes to us and my hubby was in this mood to try a different cusine We saw the menu outside and it looked good and every item was around 10 15 But what we missed was that it was the lunch menu and for dinner the prices are much higher We went and saw that each dish was over 22 25 We weren t ready to shell out so much for some restaurant that didn t even look that fancy so we just ordered a salad and a dish called 4 cheese crepes SO we don t know what the waitress understood she brought 4 pieces of that item We were 4 of us We were in no mood to pay around 100 bucks So we explained to waitress what happened So the waitress goes and talks to the chef and a bunch of 3 or 4 people are looking at us and whispering some crap We were totally embarrassed Had they been a little understanding and gracious we would have taken the order But their behavior totally irked us off and we are never ever going to this place again They crepes tasted good though 
1I0z7LHziwxeW7YQMXO5pQ Princeton What a waste of a great location Poorly prepared low quality food served by people who couldn t care less Is it that difficult to cook a decent hamburger Why does the menu say home cooked turkey when the stuff on my salad is that shiny gelatinous factory made garbage The entire Nassau Inn experience is incompetent The owners need to get out more The place looks and feels like it s run by people who have been shut in since 1972 
1i9wvVyJn9BTK-8eqwuBOQ Princeton A really lovely place Eating alone is never the most fun but here they have communal tables or you can eat at the bar The initial service wasnt great but the waiter made up for it and I had a really enjoyable evening thumbs up from me 
1Iek-D2wudsh0b7z1zkkCA Princeton I LOVE Jazams I tend to peek in here every so often and it gives me so much joy and I have so much fun looking at the beautiful toys they have to offer I don t have any young kids of my own but I am the proud god momma to two girls under the age of five and proud auntie of another rascal a four year old boy add in the fact that my friends and family are approaching the age that they will all be having children I have much need to buy many a fun toy I like to find really good fun substantial toys those that serve an educational purpose can help with development etc Jazams has such an amazing variety of toys a lot of traditional favorites stuffed animals trains legos and a lot of toys from newer companies that focus on being eco friendly or educational etc They also have tons of art kits creative toys and fun stationary items that I have bought for myself You can find yourself spending a lot of time here last time I was in here a half an hour passed without me noticing So many cute things to look at and so many things that I plan to pick up for the holidays The staff is a lot of fun young kids who are always very helpful 
1IpdCsmeuF-XFVJnf1lL5Q Princeton Their stuff is USUALLY good and service fast but I wouldn t ever eat there again My girlfriend and I both got food poisoning from their gyros I had one and put the other in the fridge 12 hours later I was sick Girlfriend didn t believe me it was the gyro ate the other one and 12 hours later same thing While it used to be my absolute favorite take out place in town George s isn t worth the risk of spending another three days unable to keep food or water down hovering over the toilet 
1is6gt-7pIsTBgLBxUXwvg Princeton Well Ztraders Joe came and disappointed so back to Wholefoods Guess they just rose in stars as they at least are consistent Lines getting a little too long though 
1itpUF7skIb7US-X6codfw Princeton A fun friendly bar right across the street from campus with decent burgers great Wed wine nights and inexpensive happy hour specials The food isn t amazing but it is good for the area and the service is usually decent if it isn t overy crowded which it will get on weekends Definitely worth stopping by if you re in Princeton and want a diverse selection of drinks accompanied by good food of either the lounge or sit down type 
1iXTL5jQh7sBAic1axbWRA Princeton Gimme a Sweet Cream and Reese s Peanut Butter Cup Blend In and watch me go from normal Carrie to super duper happy Carrie in one bite Sure the lines are usually long and the prices are high but it s worth it It s friggin Thomas Sweet and it is delicious You can keep your Blizzards and your McFlurries because this is the only ice cream candy combo that mama wants 
1jDG17wH1SzlAVr5YXLPcw Princeton We went here for New Year s Eve dinner with our in laws and had a fantastic meal I loved the rustic decor from the start and the wine list was very good good selection of domestic and international wines I loved the Jersey Greens salad with local ingredients The venison was good but the vegetables with it were exceptional The braised pork farrotto was also great I will go back in a heartbeat 
1jlQcwQAIXv3x2bKuwj_bw Princeton I recently attended an event where we were served exceptionally good bread When I asked where it was from I was told the Main Street Bakery So though I had passed this place many times I finally made a point of stopping there Yum The bakery selection is amazing and everything I tried was delicious Cookies a raspberry almond bar mini chocolate bunt cakes salads There is also a nice selection of sandwiches soups and kids entrees with some items ready to go in the case Best of all the prices are very reasonable and service is friendly In nice weather there are a few tables outside This is a place I will be returning to for breakfasts lunches and baked goods 
1jmgUth-TPO7sF0nnxhOlA Princeton PREX ARE A BUNCH OF PRICKS i went in to exchange 200 hit records and they only offered me 15 00 OR a store credit of 16 50 for the entire collection i m surprised that their front window is still in tact because I am sure they pull that BS on a lot of people that go in to sell their records F this place 
1Jo7FbL_yiPn0UuFu8VtxQ Princeton Line took 20 mins even though we arrived at 11 45am Grilled cheese had no flavor They dont have a veggi burger on the menu The chipotle and BBP sauces were awful Don t think I ll be going back 
1J_eGG_WzdJPtnNTX2Pvrw Princeton Blue Point Grill has a great atmosphere it really feels like we re at the beach The clam chowder is AMAZING My daughter loves to eat the crunchy oyster crackers that have the slightest hint of saltwater My husband likes both the fried and grilled calamari My son has found interest in the lobsters in the aquarium He also stuffs his pockets with the colorful mints A great family seafood restaurant 
1K27FhMucJ7UsL7fpo9Lpg Princeton Overpriced and not in downtown Princeton Also they have no free Internet on the property A nickel and dime charging hotel for overpriced seen better days hotel Maximum I would pay is 44 per night Priceline 
1k4ayHmVJFmRQbN7XD8jDQ Princeton I haven t been to this Walmart for about a year and a half because in the past I found shopping there to be a pretty unpleasant experience However I was looking for some DVDs and someone recommended that I try Walmart because they have a good variety so I figured I would pay the store a visit Upon entering I immediately realized that there have not been any updates to this store at all It is still difficult to navigate the narrow and crowded isles with a shopping cart The store is still very depressing and a bit disorganized especially if I compare it to Target The displays are not very inviting I wonder if they make it that way on purpose so that we feel that if it is that depressing and dreary we must be saving money I only needed a few items apart from the DVD I was looking for but I noticed that some shelves were a little sparse They were out of the items I was looking for makeup and the granola bars I wish they would improve the food section and sell produce but I guess unless it is a Superstore they don t bother to keep much of a variety of foods I was not impressed with the DVD selection although in fairness I was looking for something that probably has to be ordered online I saw a few salespeople but no one asked if I need help but it was a busy Sunday and that didn t surprise me The checkout lines were very long even the express line but the cashier was pretty cheerful which is why I am giving this 2 stars I wish more people would review this Walmart location and let people know what they think I don t plan on returning anytime soon 
1K5Z0pv-Q2_ZRrlNmVBJPw Princeton Great place to get a sandwich Not for the health conscious Many of the special sandwiches have names that deal with health problems the Heart Stop the Body Bag and the Block just to name a few The bread they use is outstanding and they are not stingy with the sauces I made a special stop with some friends when driving down route 1 and they all agreed that it was the best sandwich they ever had If you go late night be aware that the grill will be turned off exactly at closing time no matter how long you have been there but they will make cold sandwiches until the line is gone 
1k7_2VD7888NPtEvitQclg Princeton Best bagel this side of the Hudson Firm crust and doughy inside great variety of the standards and some innovative but not strange flavors Favorite order Jalapeno Cheddar bagel with veggie cream cheese 
1KEABRQOhZfWHxdSRZ8lJQ Princeton This was our first stop in Princeton U I was pretty amazed by the selection they had in this record shop The great thing about the shop is that they allow you to trade your media for store credit I wish I knew this a few months ago because I donated almost 500 CDs and DVDs I browsed the electronic section and it brought back some old memories The prices are reasonable too I will definitely return with some thought into what I want to purchase next time 
1KivPHaLo3rtySpQf5bQkQ Princeton I thought the shrimp and portabella salad was tasty mixed greens plenty of portabella pieces roasted red peppers black olives and onions mixed with oil and vinegar Could have used a few more shrimp only had 3 4 and less oil but overall I was satisfied It was a little pricey compared to other options 12 but I wasn t in the mood for pizza pasta or panini Fries with my bf s panini were just ok plain and slightly mushy We stopped off of rt 206 in Princeton in search of a non fast food meal after a long drive from NY and ended up here Could have made a worse choice and certainly beat BK or McDonalds 
1Kk5D8sE6fCw-Bd6N8Po7Q Princeton ONION RINGS ARE THE BOMB HERE And so are the cheap drinks 
1KQnad0sLzmdrsgzex9krw Princeton I am downgrading my rating again after coming here today This place has really gone downhill compared to what it was like a year ago They now only give 2 naans and they aren t even fresh anymore Just dry nasty naan An indian buffet that doesn t always give fresh naan is horrible and really indicative of how poor their business is doing The food quality was still okay but the naan really made me regret coming here This place is now the worst out of the 4 indian buffets in Princeton Palace of India doesn t serve fresh naan but at least their delicious tandoori chicken makes up for it Tandoori Bite is by far the best followed by Mehek which is slightly above Palace of India Definitely stay away from this place 
1mZjVB1U2DPjWlOh2-Zn4g Princeton If you have never been to a Hooters then you just don t get it When we arrived this Hooters was located inside a shopping center and wasn t that busy We were greeted by many females with their Hooters popping out I like the idea that we get to pick where we want to sit I don t like the idea that we don t get to pick what girl serves us Our waitress fit the blonde stereotype perfectly You expect to have a good time at Hooters and she didn t bring her A game She also forgot a part of our order I wasn t impressed by her skills or her Hooters The food at Hooters is typical bar food After you eat here you can easily fall into a food coma I did love the buffalo shrimp so much that I had to order another round The loaded tots are good to share and you need to eat then with a fork I do love the fact that you have a roll of paper towels at the table The beer here is alright Our Hooters girl poured us glasses from our pitcher My glass was served with a crack in it This is a huge safety and health hazard The bathroom in the Hooters of Princeton is the dirtiest and most disgusting restaurant bathroom I have ever been in There was even poo on the toilet seat I would definitely try to find another Hooters to visit if you want to see Hooters 
1n-OvM_eRgJy8_goUFJ-mw Princeton This time I had the veggieburger sans sauce It was delicious crisp spicy and firm with fresh lettuce summer tomatoes and hot hot onions that made my nostrils burn I m gonna do that again soon The fries were pretty good too but I left half of them on the plate cause there were too many to be reasonable Also coffee was hot and Samara was incredibly attentive You win PJ s 
1N27iTI3jO_2V5yQIxvhFg Princeton Romeos added a nice outdoor seating area a couple of years ago which is probably its best feature The food in the restaurant section is pretty typical suburban italian fare I m not sure why an Italian restaurant that seems to be run by actual Italian people makes food that seems so dull maybe it s the market they are in Plainsboro isn t exactly Little Italy The pizza side of the restaurant is a little better but still just about average Oh well if you are hungry go to Romeos just don t expect too much 
1n2ZXT6DhGC6-G9ct1syew Princeton I rarely find myself at P F Chang s mainly because I try to eat at more indie spots but every time I find myself dining at one I am always very happy and this location was no exception The wonton soup was stellar I could see heading in for just that and some Sapporo and calling it a day we also had lettuce wraps which were really good but they always are and mongolian beef I am not gonna lie I have had better Mongolian beef but all in all I was a big fan the service was prompt the beer was cold and the food was delish If I am ever in the neighborhood again I would stop back in for sure 
1NixbYrsEckQkb4CmOSymg Princeton They always have what I need However the store is not well lit and half of the shelves are empty They always look like they re just opened and aren t done stocking everything yet but I ve been coming here for a pretty long time and it always looks like that Kind of weird 
1NzBjnRw5g6hxkKfox5jEA Princeton Good if you re in a pinch and in the area and browsing picking out goodies is fun but I wouldn t go out of my way to come here About 750 difference places to pay and only certain items can be paid for at certain registers so the whole experience is kind of long winded and confusing Very visually appealing setup and worth checking out at your leisure 
1ODk_O5GvZTjqs9LcRoVtw Princeton The Sushi here was decent Not the best I have ever had but for the area it is very good I went during the off time between lunch and dinner and therefore didn t have to wait I tried many different rolls and the ones that stood out were the Stacey Roll which I have had before at Kenji Fusion and the Salmon Skin because I have never had any Roll like it before The Stacey mostly because of it s sauce can stack up to Rolls at any Sushi spot But I found everything to be just good The price was reasonable The Decor is very modern and gives the place an upscale feel even though there are some dings and scrapes on the walls I have only tried the Sushi so I can t speak to the other dishes If there was a rating for 2 5 stars I would probably give it that 
1ODX-YUVN-UP53XOusf77A Princeton The falafel sandwiches here are off the wall It s a beautiful grab it and go store with tons of variety I also really dig the wide sampling of interesting drinks and sodas available Absolutely perfect for a quick lunch or picnic takeout 
1OpkgxVDnt6wSaBfW0f-XA Princeton The hot chocolate is so good It s super rich and tastes like basically a melted chocolate bar in a cup that s warm and covered in whipped cream It s a bit overpriced I think one small cup of the hot chocolate is about 3 50 then if you want their homemade marshmallow it s like 50 cents extra or something 
1OQdaznkYrIbr-qR3VAvgA Princeton First time there thought to myself Hope this isn t a bad decision It wasn t however I ordered the pla lard prik white fish lightly fried with coconut chili sauce Very good but not as spicy as I would have liked The service was fast the bill cheap and the water glass full constantly I can see why some reviews are negative but I enjoyed my meal thoroughly 4 stars for great service and solid food 
1OuBl8RODxbxdKSZ0XvX9g Princeton can go toe to toe with anyplace I ve dined at in NYC and for us a neighborhood place which really treats you like it never had a bad dish wine list and cocktails are excellent and extensive Jeff is a miracle for wine selections and hosts tastings too 
1P0_5tZHojME9rIrPUy0CQ Princeton They have lots of options They have pancakes french toast eggs bagels and basically any breakfast food Also a good variety of coffee and drinks I tried the French Toast bagel toasted with cream cheese and it was a little less than 3 00 which I think is pretty pricey for some dough and dairy But when I had the first bite I thoroughly enjoyed it It was a perfect combination of sweet but not too sweet and it complimented the cream cheese and it was was perfectly toasted and a good combination of chewy and soft I usually go to the Bagel Hole in West Windsor but I would highly recommend this place as well Their bagel variety isnt as extensive as the Bagel Hole but they do have the basics Next time I go I will be trying the Super Cinnamon bagel 
1p6o167uNS5cwE35lqqLiA Princeton We love the quality taste and price Only drawback is no indoor seating 
1pbNIXSjp9nof1XU5y8kSQ Princeton Very good price for the quality which is EXCELLENT and stable For example almond Croissant cream puff tea and coffee was 8 The atmosphere of the shop reminds me of the local bakery I used to visit in the Caribbean small simple but clean The pastry and cakes are rich but not as rich as chez alice which is nearby But they are not as light and airy as Japanese cakes if you have a preference for those personally I like them all But I do believe anybody Japanese who remembers how western sweets were in Japan during the early 80 s will NOT be disappointed If you believe American cup cakes reign supreme and beard papa cream puffs are the summit of pastry then this is not the store for you I enjoy a good cup cake occasionally but every time I go to a cup cake store yelp raves about I end up being severely disappointed Don t expect American service or convenience The owner is very quiet in manner and sets his own standards I have never seen him being rude but I have seen American customers slightly annoyed with his quiet manner and insistence on sticking to his schedule of baking to keep things fresh If you are used to suburb style local french bakeries then you will have no problems here note 1 COME EARLY 8 30 9am Just like bakeries in France most of the stuff is gone by noon You can still get macarons and some croissants though 2 the shop does not take credit cards so come prepared with cash 3 I recommend drinking tea here over coffee The coffee has room for improvement the coffee does not live up to the sweets being served 
1Q-4sSlEj4adEKybD70kQA Princeton Love this place very tasty entrees good salads and an excellent choice of good wines The pizza and wine tasting on Mondays is a treat Wait staff is well informed and pleasant 
1qALdt0HzeKnn6mfBOYM1w Princeton My friend and I went to Princeton today and we had simple lunch at Chez Alice Cafe Bakery The staff there were really nice We both ordered the quiche combo So basically it includes a small quiche a pasta salad and a drink For this much food the price was really fair We also got a piece of mango mousse cake which was really fluffy and soft 
1qEm7NiqRjm3ok4Z7A2D-Q Princeton are you guys all mental THIS PLACE SUCKS a few years ago my brother told me we should go eat there because it was really good and has a lot of food at least the second part of that was true my brother and i BOTH got diarrhea before we even left the joint uh oh it is way worse quality than any mcdonald s white castle wendy s etc everything is soooo greasy and the desserts make me want to vomit they had some cloudy white jell o cubes that looked suspicious they were also serving chicken feet i have to admit i tried them bad idea jeans yeah they have a great selection of horrible oily garbage maybe i should try the american food but like at that point why even go to a chinese buffet i agree with the person who said that it was hilarious but the food is definitely so so so bad 
1QfK4bSwsJ1TAxBelMIoXg Princeton I am an easy customer to please I overtip I don t ask for things made special for me I ve done the job so I empathize with those serving me That said my experience here was unfortunate Ordered the Epic Burger it wasn t epic Small with a poor choice of bun and accompanied by I kid you not about 20 fries We sat at the bar and I m sorry to say the bartender had no redeeming qualities You don t have to chat me up just be somewhat friendly pay attention to empty beer glasses in a reasonable amount of time The beer was decent 
1qMhq2uUKMUbfWMZ29kEDg Princeton I pass by this place frequently on my way to Princeton and decided to treat myself during the 4th of July holiday I chose the Fire package which included a 30min private soak 90min full body massage plus an exfoliating back scrub All were amazing and I can t believe it was only 170 I was there for almost 3 hours and my attendant was great Everything is beautifully decorated from the lobby to the locker rooms to the outside soaking tubs I can t wait to come back and try the tubs at night or in the winter I highly recommend this place either for a quick soak in the hot water or for one of their great package deals 
1Qsv-viCLe35xDd8KBxxFQ Princeton The hoagies at Hoagie Haven are the best You don t have to travel to Philly for the perfect hoagie when you have this awesome place in Princeton NJ The hoagie roll they use for their hoagies and hot sandwiches are amazing It is so soft the texture is perfect It s all about the roll and Hoagie Haven is right on the mark They are also very generous with the amount of meat and toppings they put into their sandwiches Their hoagies are not for the faint at heart so be prepared to have your cholesterol checked before you visit this place This is the best sandwich shop in Princeton and probably in NJ They have a huge menu of hoagie subs and hot subs similar to the ones you will see in the grease trucks at Rutgers University These grease hoagies are also popular at Hoagie Haven The lines are long so be prepared to wait but they also close late if your looking for a midnight snack My favorite hoagies are their classic italian hoagie and they have the BEST eggplant parmesan hoagie as well 
1QUbA8MSqr_1i_KTSuciCg Princeton Make sure you don t order the peasant omlette unless you want potatoes with your potatoes you get more sausage in a jimmie dean sandwich and that won t cost you 9 bucks not worth it I really wanted a better experience since I like to support local business but this is not up to par for my standards especially with the price tag 
1QVgDWl9WTr2fgf6wTrIUA Princeton My wife and I went here for lunch We enjoyed the experience and the food While there is a glut of Japanese restaurants in Princeton including Sakura Express Moc Moc Tomo sushi and others the only legitimately Japanese restaurant is Ajihei whose owner is Japanese and worked as a chef for a pricey Manhattan place That being said my wife and I thought this was one of the best places we have been to The atmosphere is cookie cutter tatami fixtures but they accent the place well and give it a peaceful feel The food is generally served in bentou style lunch box settings more elaborate combos including tsukemono traditional sides or yakitori skewers The food is capable for the price I am not sure what Lu Y means by claiming the curry is terrible It s standard Japanese curry They are capable of making a Chicken Katsu correctly unlike Sakura Express or Tomo Sushi 11 as a bento with curry fish and spring rolls a simple salad and miso soup and my wife enjoyed her pick 3 for 12 lunch combo also including the soup and salad 
1rhrmKk6MB_vO_NIU2B09g Princeton Service can be very slow and inattentive The wait for a table can get fairly long as well Atmosphere nothing very special here Clean and neat Price much too high considering the quality of the food and service 20 40 or higher per person Food hit or miss some things are amazing others are sub par 
1rxn8_fmFrKRdzhICeVHHA Princeton Maybe I had too high of an expectation after reading some of the reviews The food is okay but nothing special 
1s0lf1lefUfxqlSwCCo6Hw Princeton the rooms here are really nice but the restaurant is pretty horrible and the temperature can get really low 
---nya_pjxWmNFDFyAcfsA Urbana Another case of the Emperor s New Clothes Someone of the artsy set decided that this relatively good but overpriced fare was great pizza and all the lemmings followed suit Will anyone tell the Emperor he has no clothes The limited hours no delivery and lack of dining area add to the snob appeal Don t be taken in 
-0bpTk8oMn75JyPlFpGRUg Urbana Ambiance is fine and it s what you expect from a campus bar The only thing that I want to say is that the staff can drop the attitude They re working or owning a bar that is in Champaign just bring down your pretentiousness and you ll be fine Don t try to be a cool lounge that s not what college esp U of I is about If you get over that fact and your staff stop being a holes you ll have alot more people going 
-0j63aKFmIcqkGSt8R0bbQ Urbana Ahh good ol Sears Truthfully I hadn t purchased anything from Sears in almost a decade so I m not sure if this review is accurate of the Sears company as a whole or just this Champaign location Within the past several months I had to make two big purchases a dishwasher and a washer dryer Both were purchased on two different visits and I dealt with different sales guys each time They must really pressure their employees on the whole service plan thing because these guys were relentless One even asked why after I d turned down the plan over and over and over Other stores big on service plans such as Best Buy do NOT pressure you THIS much When I refused the plans they actually acted upset hurt angry It was ridiculous Sears does have some good prices though so I guess you have to take the bad with the good 
-0nacVFnlwcWSmRWP8kxHQ Urbana When I decided to order from Fat Sandwich Company at 1 am I expected an extremely unhealthy pile of fried foods stuffed into a roll That s exactly what I got I ordered the Fat MILF mostly because I m immature and anything with bacon on it is probably a winner I was not drunk or high just hungry Plus everything else I wanted was closed and FSC seemed like the best remaining choice As for the sandwich it was delicious It was a really big sandwich and took me quite a while to eat but I savored every bit of it Obviously there are many people who wouldn t enjoy eating a sandwich filled with mozzarella sticks chicken fingers cheesesteak bacon and fries I am not one of those people was amazing As I ate it I felt like I was on Epic Meal Time And that my friends is when I knew I found a winner The only downfall was that it was just warm by the time it got to me Still delicious but it would have been even better if I ate it hot 
-1-LqeEjMy5nKkfFklkvtA Urbana I used to work here and I liked it at the time Now I feel that since it s probably the biggest bar in the downtown area it s like the go to place for a lot of people and just gets way too busy Also I have friends that want to go there ALL THE TIME so I feel like I m kind of burnt out on it But then again if you want to go to a place that will almost always be busy it s right up your alley 
-1sIJLX71taHD-BgbwY64Q Urbana They have some great harder to find packaged items melon bars yes please but they sold us a whole bagful of ROTTEN purple yams What We got home and started preparing them before we figured it out GROSS 
-21ZmNRDog13j5YgiTDw4A Urbana Brittish pub style cool place but like most places in the area it s always the same faces And they re not the prettiest faces 
-3k_SrnUQrHDlbtrBv9wRA Urbana Really filling Got the burger and was super satisfied The beer battered burgers was overkill Super tasty super heavy Decent price for what I got Really filling Got the burger and was super satisfied The beer battered burgers was overkill Super tasty super heavy Decent price for what I got 
-4i2Nliz6rUFMS0kha7Qdw Urbana I used them a few times during my time down here The buses were alright but they get the lowest rating for their terrible customer service It s truly that bad 
-4tpejFnTPGEUUR8uqE5bg Urbana I just walked the 6 mile trail around the park 3 times today This is close to my work so I can go and walk around the park during my lunch Today was a beautiful day to enjoy the weather Hessel park is 26 9 acres with a 6 mile walking trail around it Inside the park are various places to sit and eat a tennis court and a play area for kids In the summertime the play area has a water feature in the playground so the kids can get wet There is also a good mix of shade and sun areas Great place to walk on my lunch I dropped a star because sometimes there are bus loads of high school or middle school kids that take over the trail Depending on the time of day and time of year 
-4ZC1FnsewrAg3PLU6-YJA Urbana Of all restaurants in Chambana this is by far my favorite I used to go several times as week for either lunch or dinner when I was still in the area The food is homemade like which was always a big plus for me I prefer to be on the healthy side and Jerusalem offers that option with the bonus of being cheap And this fact makes it unique in a college town where most people are craving for cheap junk food I would go most frequently for the plate of the day 202 with chicken It is a big tray with an assortment of tasty items So big that sometimes you would end up saving half of it for dinner I can more simply define Jerusalem as tasty tasty tasty Totally love it Ah yes the owner Some people complain about him Well after going for so many times I found out he is a very warm person He might not give you a fake smile the first time you walk into his restaurant but he will give you a genuine smile the fifth time you go there 
-5hYzZRVIUGDt6K6BeWHrw Urbana Great Ice cream is delicious and you can have it any way you want It is a bit pricey but totally worth it They have a prize wheel where you win things I got a free waffle bowl Good location I like to go there after my exams The employees are always so happy too 
-6RpacY4KBQqh_fZrqzNqA Urbana This place is great the owner is the nicest guy as well It s a little hole in the wall place that if you aren t from champaign you prolly would just walk past and think nothing of But everything in here is great from hot dogs to chicken to fries to salad Cheap too Great lunch stop 
-88k4WroAFypTeGFP9kJqA Urbana Having once been a U of I student I didn t understand why people liked Pokey sticks so much We had pizza and pokey sticks over the weekend after a football game and I still done understand the love for pokey sticks Crappy pizza and crappy pokey sticks I can t even say it s because it s cheap becuase it still cost me 25 for 16 pizza and 16 pokey sticks even though I had a buy one get one free coupon I would rather have Papa john s pizza any day of the week and twice on Sundays 
-9MB5ttu0zsyooJ1QDDQrQ Urbana I was blown away by this oasis of fantastic flavor The grilled stuffed pasta was so mind bendingly delicious that I tried to recreate this at home While the description and use of two sauces sounds like it would contradict itself each of the components blend marvelously in your mouth I sampled soups and small bites as well Over all I found the flavors in each dish are well balanced and don t compete for attention There is a certain finesse that s being used in the kitchen to render distinctly memorable flavor profiles The atmosphere was inviting modern and clean The service staff knowledgeable and attentive I wish I had one where I live and will absolutely be back when I find myself in Champaign again 
-9xIezAkBAtDBEZaIeiYoA Urbana Great school There are a lot of different types of people here so its easy to fit in As an electrical engineer its great that I can be at a school that is thoroughly respected for my major but at the same time I have tons of options to go out and have fun Its the perfect mix of academics and college life in my opinion at least for engineers 
-A0bV3UsfVnOEmjuajpfBQ Urbana Amazing New Mexican Restaurant I hadn t heard about Maize just saw it pop up on First and Green where during my 4 years here on campus I ve seen many establishments come and simply disappear Me and my roommate all mexican went to try it highly suspicious that any place around here could actually offer authentic mexican cuisine Boy were we wrong This place is great It does everything right taco quesadillas huaraches and even tortas It s the level of authenticity you might expect from a place like Nuevo Leon I wish they just had more seating and were able to offer a dinner type atmosphere and menu Great lunch and cheap dinner food They are missing a lot of dinner items such as enchiladas mole or pozole However everything they do do they do it right Their salsas are great their tortillas delicious Everything has the perfect amount of grease Seasoning could be better but it s better that they under salt than over salt Definitely try this place out 
-a1s-Y6Y3nsosirGfGp1dw Urbana Pros Cheap huge portions friendly staff Cons This is not the best C U has to offer as far as Mexican food What I ordered First visit enchiladas verdes chicken with a side of beans The salsa verde was bland notably lacking in onion garlic cilantro and salt The chicken was seasoned with a sweet and smoky tomato sauce the smoke flavor overpowered the salsa verde tortillas cheese and cream They use sour cream not Mexican crema which was disappointing The beans were lacking in flavor I don t know if they were canned or if they were boiled in water without onion garlic etc Second visit steak tacos and rice The tacos were so greasy it was as if the meat was deep fried and then they poured two tablespoons of oil in the taco I asked for a flour tortilla expecting hoping for a good flour tortilla unfortunately it wasn t any better than the store bought flour tortillas in the refrigerator section having that unmistakable preservative taste Bottom line Probably fine if you just want nachos and margaritas and don t know good Mexican food but head elsewhere for non Americanized fare 
-atd9oj0AaKxVDzmGP_W_g Urbana Oh Cly s it bills itself as one of the classier bars on campus But don t let that fool you it s just as slimy and gross as Kams or CO s or Gully s The floors are gross the bathrooms are a nightmare and somehow it s classy Probably because the bartenders wear button downs and ties There is always a line at this place and there is always a cover The bartenders think their shit smells like roses and it always smells like puke and stale beer But specials oh the specials allow for a lot of forgiveness on my part Wine night always meant a good time read blacked out drunkenness The themed parties were entertaining And there was absolutely enough room to dance at all times Clientle is attractive mostly naked if they re girls and YOUNG mostly under 21 This is a place to see and be seen It COULD be a really classy place but it isn t 
-b3LdDyO8278QuYEk43KpA Urbana This hidden away small eatery has the best Thai food in town The prices are reasonable and there must be some addictive enzyme they add to the food because I can t seem to get enough of it My favorite dish is the turkey shrimp pad Thai Unfortunately it has ruined my eating pad Thai anywhere else since this is the best 
-Ba__HkKEHCauDrXMYY5NQ Urbana this is what i would call a sweet book shop i have been shopping here since i was a freshman in college 17 years later i still find myself wandering in here when i m in need of a distraction the staff are very helpful and always amaze me when they are able to locate something imagine an old building with a zillion floors nooks and crannies and then piles upon piles of old books everywhere i know it sounds like heaven doesn t it well it is you will walk in searching for something and walk out found 
-bj1macVgiwK0ZWlY0OJZA Urbana Papa Del s is my favorite stuff crust pizza ever Oh man back when I was in school it used to be a real treat to go here Usually if someone was visiting and had a car this was one of the destinations The pizza takes a LONG time to make which is expected But it s SO delicious I live up in Chicago now but I haven t forgotten you Papa Del s 
-bLRTk1jPOsA7BRkIpAV7g Urbana After being a loyal patron for seven years I am done with this place While they still have some great drink selections the service has gotten so bad On a Friday afternoon I was one of six sitting at the bar Two bartenders and 1 2 servers were working and it still took them 20 minutes to take my order With the downtown Champaign scene evolving this kind of situation is unacceptable 
-bVh-5A1dLNg5ioJrfE6GQ Urbana Amazing frozen custard I like to stick to the basics vanilla or chocolate on a waffle cone The stuff is just great 
-BYbZ2tMgvJxd_fGKzWMgQ Urbana Amazing food for the price I love the cucumber salad they start you off with The bento box is also awesome It s great if you want just a little bit of everything and at around 8 it was well worth every penny Their sushi alone is also amazing It feels more like a traditional Japanese restaurant compared to other restaurants in Champaign I ll definitely be back 
-cF-ONUKJHXbNTNniibbWw Urbana So delicious Lemon custard with cold fudge is a favorite 
-cQn_d14-CJxbrKRpoE_Pw Urbana We usually sit at the bar and order up tapas and drinks The bartender never missed a chance to mix us up a mean cocktail of his own creation The food is good and priced right The atmosphere is also wonderful and very unique They also serve brunch which is great 
-d3Hvz2SgQb335VQhINVTA Urbana Excellent Chinese food in the Champaign Urbana area Of course the standard American Chinese food is offered but one should try the authentic Sichuan cuisine or even hot pot Fair prices excellent balance of flavor consistently high standards It worth the trip to Lincoln Square mall to eat at this hidden gem 
-EL79mGaEy4iTs7rM1CdYA Urbana Mock duck yummy vegan dishes Yummy Get them now Eat them now mmmmmmmmm 
-fb3dbtMEBzQBvHg8cDzDw Urbana Probably the largest Asian grocery store in the area They have a huge supply of ramen no not maruchan shakes fist and ingredients Though not as produce centric as Far East they have much more in terms of sauces frozen food and even cooking untensils Don t miss out on grabbing some cuttle fish chips crushed pear juice and some frozen man doo among the many things you can find here but nowhere else 
-fON58IFcx3lgD7ycMu5Ig Urbana Ate here early sep 12 Hadn t been in over a year Why did I wait so long Got the russell burger and it was delish Got chips and salsa instead of fries Very grateful to be able to do something other than fries Our waitress was great and we were served by who I m guessing is the owner Mr Faren You can tell they are committed to having the best burgers in town 
-fVKoB8mRKoLJvTsAE71cw Urbana Mas Amigos is consistently the best place to get Mexican food in C U Their staff are incredibly friendly and the place always feels warm and welcoming whenever I enter I invariably get something with chorizo because 1 They do it well here and 2 I EFFING LOVE CHORIZO AND YOU CANNOT TELL ME ANY DIFFERENT SO THERE When life is hard or you want a moment to celebrate an accomplishment in grad school end of a conference successful presentation glad you survived another week then it is time to pitch in for a pitcher or three of margaritas They are decently sized about the right strength and although a little too sweet still manage to make a fun evening even more fun And if this hasn t convinced you of the joys of Mas Amigos know that it also boasts a view of the wonderfully dubious C U landmark Illini Arcade Yes that s right you can see the wooden fence that obscures the parking lot of the sex emporium known as Illini Arcade whilst you enjoy delicious Mexican food and or watch awesome Spanish language TV I m just saying it makes for a wonderful night Also CHORIZO 
-g20hFwF8oS1XuhIFJng2A Urbana I ve been here only once as of yet and I loved it I love their pizza menu The combinations are interesting or you can make your own and the crust is very good I had a mustard base sauce pizza that was awesome I loved it Nowhere else could I go for this pizza We had three pizzas at the table and I enjoyed all of them very much I think the environment is a lot of fun also The price is fair It s 6 99 for a personal pizza which a good size I m looking forward to coming back 
-g5blxbKP5SPFLfrkIuv5A Urbana Fantastic bbq seitan sandwich Even better than the one offered clover in cambridge ma 
-G9ShgXVcrS-x5kWRMiynQ Urbana In town for a film festival and heard about this place when John Malkovich mentioned being accosted by a drunk girl who had come from here Sounded like our kind of place Loved the atmosphere and music The place has a sort of rustic feel Lots of wood and dark wood colors Nice and quiet on a Saturday afternoon I swear they were playing Tom Waits when we got there a big plus in my opinion Cigar friendly also a plus Just a very comfortable and casual sort of place Service was good My friends wanted shots Despite being a beer oriented bar the bar tender was very friendly and able to cook something up for us Beer selection was excellent about 15 taps and 60 70 bottles all of it well chosen It was a pleasure to try a Great Lakes Blackout Stout on tap Then a nice Goose Island 1800 Demolition Ale served with proper glassware We actually enjoyed it so much we went back the next day If we come back for the same festival next year this will definitely be on the list of places to hit while in town 
-gDq55BhX1JvvsQcLk3xEQ Urbana This is one of the few places that I shop when I come to Champaign The mall is kind of lacking this sort of style so if you re willing to go to campus this is the spot 
-Ge_Vaz-bObDKDlTNBajMA Urbana If you want good pizza in Champaign Papa Del s is the place to go Their Sicilian Pan pizza is some of the best I have ever had They also have half price slices everyday from 3 4 p m Can t beat a deal like that 
-gu_D7OmkNreC_tdzhHsMw Urbana After the Furniture Lounge in downtown Champaign closed I decided to have a look at the one in Urbana last summer While the Champaign location had a basement full of clothing and a few furniture items this one was almost entirely furniture and decorations and seemed a bit more sparse in its inventory While I can t complain about the quality of service or the workers here I can say that it is entirely overpriced While there is a fair selection of interesting stuff I don t feel that the prices they ask for on their furniture are reasonable even factoring in the expensive nature of these vintage stores While I went looking for paintings and other decorations for my apartment I ended up leaving empty handed since I couldn t stomach the prices 
-hepP8WoOSRAXMRnzaSppQ Urbana Cheap Asian food though on the oily side Cravings definitely gets busy during the lunch hours though The owner is a cool guy he knows a ton of Asian languages and dialects Oh yeah don t eat in the restaurant unless you want to go back to class lab smelling like Chinese food 
-hkyRxSAQmxTvqKEPPxLVw Urbana Best BBQ in town Unfortunately everyone knows it so the wait can be pretty long 30 40 min at peak hours But you can get a drink to pass the time My favorite is rib tips with Carolina Red sauce but everything is great here The beer selection is not huge but it is always terrific and they switch it up a lot Service is friendly and the food is usually ready quickly since it s all smoked I eat here at least once a week and am not tired of it yet Good thing since I always take home leftovers 
-iMbiA6M-Ar0PlupTc2YWQ Urbana I love this bar If you ve been here before and had a bad experience I encourage you to try it again The bar has undergone a change in ownership and management a remodel and the hookah and alcohol are now separate The drinks are inexpensive and very strong They aren t joking when they call them Stron Islands They have 2 dart boards and 2 pool tables for the game oriented and new booths for those who aren t My favorite night to go to Green Street is Tuesday They have Outlaw Karaoke the same awesome karaoke DJ who does White Horse Wednesday nights but without the flooded bathrooms Bud and Miller family bottles are only 2 and Mikey and Dan have a whole list of signature drinks if you re not into beer Overall Green Street is a great place to grab a drink any night of the week 
-JSFirBfNXoDTBsB8RAc3w Urbana Siam Terrace is probably second for Thai food in CU And even then it s pretty close Both restaurants have their particular strengths so part of it depends on what you re in the mood for The staff is very friendly although sometimes a little slow if it gets busy I think they have the best pad thai in town To me it has the perfect blend of sweetness nutiness and spice complimented by the fresh bite of the cilantro and crunch of sprouts and shredded carrot It s sweeter than your typical pad thai but it s very well balanced overall Their appetizers are nicely priced and I have enjoyed all of them that I tried I would not recommend the Thom Kha soup here It s a bit too sweet and lacks some of the depth of other versions of this soup I ve had It s not bad by any means but it wasn t what I was looking for in that soup Be bold with spice here It can vary but I find that they tend to be a bit more gentle with the spice overall A big plus for Siam Terrace is its selection of sushi It s decently priced for the most part and everything I ve had is tasty I d definitely recommend their Bakery sushi It s moderately priced and is battered and served with some excellent eel sauce Be careful when you first get it though as it s VERY hot For a drink I recommend trying the coconut juice or Thai Iced Tea Both are refreshing and a great sweet compliment to the spicier dishes 
-KClFfe3QFxQW1WGhPsbeA Urbana It s Pops for Pizza or No Place at All Seriously this is the best pizza you will ever have deep dish that is And yes I ve had Chicago pizza at the institutions and this is still way better Beware though the place is insane on weekends and it takes 45 minutes to bake a pie so call ahead if you think you re going to be bored talking to your table mates for that long I would give Papa Dels 5 stars but the last 3 times I ve been there the service has sucked not the rude sucky but they have jacked up our order every time We want thick they give us thin We wanted pepperoni they give us sausage This last time we asked to see the manager and tried to at least get a free za out of it no free food here owner s policy he says Normally this would piss me off so much I would never go back but the pizza is just so damn good I do anyway Sigh 
-kfzjU_hKjLQxBMVsEyDRQ Urbana Waiter There are pubes in my fruit cup Thought the pineapple tasted fishy No like actual fucking fish It tasted like a fish in my mouth Then I found a pube on my cantaloupe It s been a rough morning Needless to say my therapist is not going to be happy about this See photos 
-KM4MlhbjHLM_pm4FdMhbw Urbana Update Ok I had dinner at the Black Dog The ribs were to die for the beer selection makes me feel like I ve gone to brew heaven and the service was good Now only if they were open on Sundays This place pretty much does what it needs to Great beer selection real lemonaide awesome meat ok service I didn t have a single complaint It beats the pants off of the other bbq places in town for taste and offerings Yum 
-kMXBjx9Xz0aFhdzkNuTAg Urbana I m not going to do too much of an in depth review most of the basics have already been covered below but I must note that their lattes are astounding I never actually had a latte prior to going here but just decided to go for it since they have 2 latte Wednesdays the Carmel Latte here is excellent now it s a mainstay of mine Also great for its obvious proximity to the Psych building even though I ve only taken one class there A little excessive on the Starbuck s bashing though hoorah pretention 
-Ks98RTyJ_afcr1PJ7WZRg Urbana I ve only ordered one dish here but I can t stray from it because it is so amazing MOCK DUCK BASIL Order it eat it love it One of the best vegetarian dishes ever 
-kwdgH7RyLHl10CxOlkDfw Urbana Zorba s burned to the ground March 23 2011 
-LDcT5V5AdQPSImEReJP9g Urbana Came here for my birthday Was greeted at the door by the host and led into the dining room that was dimly lit by candlelight We ordered a couple glasses of pinot noir and were happy with their selection Our appetizer the broiled goat cheese was amazing The grilled bread provided great texture to the meaty pumpkin seed and spice spread and the divine creaminess of the goat cheese Our entrees were the two dinner specials for the evening seared diver scallops and a filet Our scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned The accompanying puree had pieces of bacon which perfectly complemented the entire dish Our filet was a beautiful medium rare piece of meat that just melted in my mouth The bourbon demi glace and gratin brought the dish together into a very enjoyable experience We tried two desserts the molten chocolate cake and the green tea white chocolate mousse I absolutely loved the mousse while my partner preferred the chocolate cake The best part of the rich chocolate cake was the fresh mint ice cream that came with it Overall it was an amazing dinner Go to Radio Maria and order their dinner specials You will not be disappointed 
-lHYAiXWm-LIItx58GCv2A Urbana Best bulgogi around this area 
-lmJOvp1nysp2j0fRSPXOg Urbana Positively horrendous The food is sickening greasy stale and in horrid combinations mozzarella sticks and chicken nuggets and mayonnaise and fries on a donut bun really The tables are never wiped off or cleaned and we had to sit in these gross chairs with used kleenexes tossed everywhere which we grudgingly had to pick up and throw out ourselves My friend used the restroom and reported that her shoes stuck to the floor with every step The entire place was swarming with flies It Was Very Bad 
-lY2W5cajeP2c1d85DFBlw Urbana I have really curly hair and was looking for a place that did the DevaCurl cut and I found it Jake was the person that cut my hair and he was awesome First and foremost he was very knowledgeable about curly hair how to cut it and how to style it He wasn t trying to sell me any product in there just to sell it he actually recommended some super cheap sally s products that he said would do the same thing as some of the expensive stuff He took the time to talk to me about my hair and who I can maintan my curls The salon is very different but I liked It had a very edgy feel to it and the stylists fit in really well with the salon Everyone was very polite and helpful and one stylists brings her little dog in But be prepared because if you don t have treats the dog won t talk to you LOL My hair cut was 40 which to me is not a lot for a good knowledgeable stylist Alot of people have been complaining about the cost and you really get what you pay for when you try to go with a cheaper stylist It is funny how people will pay hundreds of dollars for jeans shoes and purses which people only see every once in a while but when they get their hair cut or colored they want to spend the least amount possible even though people see your hair every day Quit being cheap people and get a good hair cut 
-MmtcAnCv3zpWrImWHZ4qA Urbana I have a few qualms with Luna I want to love it I really do but I just can t The first time I went there was with a large party for Mom s weekend and we had a reservation We ended up waiting an hour to be seated There was no sitting area just a hallway so it was rather uncomfortable When we were finally seated we had a delicious meal Second time I went there was for a date with my boyfriend We are both vegetarians and we had no problems finding enough food to eat We left full and a little tipsy good wine I went for a third time recently with my two roommates and it was a disaster There was hardly anyone at the restaurant but we still had terrible service They seemed understaffed apparently due to rehearsal dinner going on simultaneously I can give some leeway on that but there was no excuse for the kind of neglect we received My friend had a very rare steak that took forever to be sent back We were out of drinks for a very long time and we needed other things that a more attentive waitress would have easily noticed I want to love this place but service is a huge deal for me It s disappointing that Luna can t excel in this because I do think they have some good food 
-myEZHy7h4VBB8LvAnUegg Urbana I went again and my experience was much better the second time around This time I decided to try one of the recommended burgers I think they were called Chef Inspired instead of building my own I had the Hawaiian Pineapple Jalapenos cheese and bbq sauce I think It was much better my burger was a lot less greasy and it stayed together quite well I got the Cajun fries again those were pretty good as well I went again with a large group 7 people and the staff saved a table for us while we were in line That was awesome since it was pretty crowded on a Saturday night Pros Tasty burger A large fry is plenty for 2 people to split Not overloaded on cajun flavor Staff was excellent again I didn t get a milkshake but they looked kinda expensive for the size but supposedly they taste pretty good Cons Fries were alright I had a lot of little pieces in the order I split with a friend Overall I had a much better second experience at Meatheads I would recommend that you try one of the chef inspired burgers I can say that I will come back here again 
-nty1qjoJIzp59Ci_zbM_A Urbana I m so glad we still have a record store in Champaign Great helpful staff If what you re looking for is not in stock they will order it Orders are usually in within the week by my experience They offer a really nice record collection and have great deals sidewalk sales on used CDs Can you find cheaper prices online Sure but buying here shows support to not only Exile but Champaign and the downtown area The town is better for having Exile here let s keep it that way 
-NzGbu46J2s9oDArfVam_A Urbana closed closed closed 
-oN1jB3DFeUyikh29MJBhg Urbana I am sad it has taken me this long to wake up on a Saturday in time to go to the Farmers Market I finally went yesterday and loved it The people were nice there is plenty of parking lots of food to choose from and other vendors like soap candles wood working and the awesome t shirt lady who makes her own designs Seriously go check her booth out Once you go you ll be hooked 
-p7xO7nbPYggBv8y3b3OPQ Urbana I like the beer selection but we went there for a birthday party where I brought a cake and they wanted to charge me a 5 plate fee It was so absurd we had all bought dinner a bottle of wine etc It seems like they don t want groups to converge there I ll go somewhere else next time 
-pHeT5N4-qCw1IFJC7drgg Urbana Ok I have to admit I really wanted to like this place This whole upscale burger joint concept is really growing right now and I kinda dig the idea I ve been here on three occasions hoping that I was just missing something Unfortunately It s just not that good As others have mentioned the staff really seems to try and are friendly The atmosphere is as expected Sort of an industrial modern atmosphere with lots of wood It s a new facility so it s clean and tidy in upkeep Can t fault any of these items But then there s the food Burgers fries drinks and shakes Pretty much that s it There is a selection of theme burgers and a build your own option First time I went I had the basic Cheeseburger It came promptly in a basket with a pile of fries The burger was covered in so many toppings that it was really just a topping sandwich flavored with meat Everything was so greasy and sloppy that you really had to eat it with a knife and fork Meh not my thing But I figured I d give it one more chance and try a build your own next time This wasn t much better There s just no flavor to the burger and it s a sloppy mess to eat I decided to splurge on a shake this time to take with me By the time all was said and done I was out darn near 15 00 Way too expensive for a burger and fries Then about two weeks ago I was late to an appointment and needed a quick lunch As I mentioned I really wanted to like this place so I decided to swing in and give it one more try Ordered a bacon cheeseburger this time Even worse than the first two Size and quality had dropped from the first two times always a bad sign Seems like they are starting to cut corners Again dropping 10 for lunch really isn t going to work Culver s on a good day make a way better burger for quite a bit less There are a couple new places with this theme opening in the next few months around town Let s hope they are an improvement 
-qBQXNiJIpjFEoZbj3ZAbg Urbana This is one of my favorite bars to hang out in Urbana Whenever I feel like listening to some jazz music I would check this place out because many local musicians play here The food here is super CHEAP I think the salmon burger is just 4 and 1lb fries for 2 It is excellent with their black pepper sauce They have specials on other days as well 
-qQbE8qeQFwmlA7vnRxKPQ Urbana One of the nicest coffee shops on campus Seating is haphazard a large number of teeny tiny tables and a few larger tables that would be nice for group work but are typically monopolized by a solitary and grumpy looking person Lighting is good though People here tend towards the quiet so if you come here to chat expect angry looks Can t comment on the coffee I hear it is good but for those of us who don t like coffee this is the place Tea is high quality and the chai is fantastic unlike Royale s Chai which is watered down and awful They also have gelato here but the Crepe Cafe s gelato far surpasses it 
-q_jLt9Gmtekefr_UCJaWA Urbana Like all the reviews say this is a popular place Plan to wait on the curb literally for your table with the rest of the hungry patrons Ordered the platters 3 meat choices and we mixed up the sides Meat was excellent and the highlight was the burnt ends Wow Don t miss them Sweet potato fries were good but I ve had better probably because these ones had cooled down This is a don t miss food destination that should satisfy your BBQ craving 
-r-EuQOcq0FKF8aJuURShw Urbana The Hubster and I decided to do a date night try out Destihl and then go see The Exorcist at the Virginia our date night may not be your definition of romantic but that s neither here nor there I d heard about how crowded Destihl gets around dinnertime and never having been there before I went the AARP route and reserved a table for us at 5 15 to give ample time for slow service this was unnecessary I was surprised to learn that Destihl is cavernous There was absolutely no shortage of tables How does it ever get crowded Who knows In any case we were irritatingly seated near the only large loud party in the entire restaurant Nothing like listening to a bunch of screechy teenagers dressed up for Homecoming say semi racist things and then shush each other on date night We got appetizers and small plate y things to constitute our meal All were finger food all were messy and delicious We tried the cheese curds lightly breaded crunchy thoroughly melty thai chicken wings a nicely spicy slow burn flavorful thick sauced with fabulous peanuts sprinkled over the top and beer boiled shrimp a tad too much seasoning that clung to our fingers and overwhelmed most other flavors not much beer taste but otherwise you know cold shrimp are tasty on their own I tried a pint of their black IPA which I thoroughly enjoyed We also shared their chocolate trio or M nage Trois or whatever they call it which consisted of mexican hot chocolate thick hot nom a chocolate tart delicious filling but with a crust that was absolutely impossible to cut into making it awkward to eat much less share and zanzibar chocolate ice cream heaven I need to try more things to be sure that this is actually a problem but I feel like everything on their menu is too complicated There are SO MANY INGREDIENTS listed on every single menu item Too many seasonings too many flavor combinations Every time I read something I was like Mmm yes yes yes oh no you went too far Our waiter was extremely enthusiastically friendly to the point of making us feel a bit awkward I mean he hung out and chatted I don t harbor ill will against the guy or anything he was really nice but you know I m on a date with my main squeeze please leave Considering all the stuff we got our tab was surprisingly cheap I think we were out for under 30 I waffled between 3 5 and 4 stars but I m feeling generous today 
-R50dceov_qN1YWd32QTDQ Urbana We eat here on a monthly basis and we have had positive experiences every time we eat here The service can be a little bit slow at times but overall they do well The owners also work in the establishment so they always do everything to make sure you are happy The food is good and moderately priced it is worth a trip to check it out 
-RaYs0lOfALHTsLnWd3jcw Urbana Sadly I discovered Kofusion only a couple months before I graduated but once I discovered the place I quickly became a regular Firstly people should recognize the restaurant for what it is Korean fushion food Thus there s a wide variety of sushi my personal favorite hwe dup bap like sashimi salad and a smaller selection of hot but still great scallops anyone entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much If you need a quick sushi fix dollar sushi Sundays 1 roll 1 will definitely satisfy your cravings There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll read little to no raw fish At first I was really disappointed by this but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough Big Roll Coconut Roll that I didn t mind at all and eat about 15 20 worth of sushi anyway Yes I am a sushi whore If you really want good sushi with more raw fish or more interesting combinations Kofusion is still the place to go Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow type rolls and more It s about 1 2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I ve never felt like my rolls weren t worth the cost Finally Kristina is my favorite waitress Maybe she remembered me for my order hwe dup bap seriously try it if you love raw fish it is divine or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well but after just a few weeks of going weekly a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly As a sushi lover it doesn t really get any better than this I m not going to lie Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi I don t find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll i e Big Roll that s the one I had wrapped in soy rice paper For those that don t like sushi because of the seaweed this is a great alternative For those that still love sushi try it anyway it s a great substitution that s worth it to get on its own once in awhile I will forever miss Kofusion now that I m not in the area so please go get the hwe dup bap Big Roll Coconut Roll or even the thai curry for me please 
-rKylh2Qay8w-hXwqhu3UQ Urbana Food is always fast and fresh here And I ve noticed the naan has gotten considerably larger since I last set foot in here in early 2007 But I m not complaining 
-srxCNfukfK-bUWY4yr6yA Urbana This is my favorite place to eat Chinese food on campus Golden Harbor might have a little bit better tasting food but this is about half the price You can t go wrong with any schezuan beef or brocoli and beef Also I would highly recommend the Dry Chili Chicken off the Chinse menu That dish is amazing 
-SWI5A1QRQnpvOz-L5Aipg Urbana Five Star Bubble Tea Ok everyone is right about the food However that is not the prize at Cafe Evo Now listen I recently moved here from Oakland CA The Bay Area knows alot about killer bubble tea with tapioca pearls No one can challenge this But let me tell you something Cafe Evo is the only bubble tea within a two hour drive to Chicago that is worth finding I recommend Banana Taro or Coconut and you have to order it as banana snow with pearls Shake it up before you plunge the straw in and try not to suck it all down in the car before you get back to work I for one have always devoured the whole thing before I can get five minutes back across town Pitiful but incredible Oh and don t expect them to be nice 
-Sy8AbbrGqiaAoRIRUNsWg Urbana Better service but they still need to step up their game 
-szZCfhGmwsRA6xTV6UcVQ Urbana I have been taking my various automobiles to Rick for 16 years and highly recommend him For over two years I suggested it may be time for new brakes before he finally agreed that it was time for new brakes Rick knows his cars he is especially adept with foreign cars His prices may be a bit higher than other shops but his work has always been excellent Rick is not a slick super gregarious guy so as Tim J stated you won t get a warm fuzzy feeling but you will get an honest answer from a nice guy 
-UEpk7rjYp1cNQfAvQUFkg Urbana It is similar to Flat Top Grill which has been a campus favorite for a few years However the atmosphere is better the ingrediants a bit fresher and it is NOT on campus which is huge for us townies It has a more up scale vibe as opposed to Flat Top s college student vibe I do wish they had some sample dishes good sauce mix ideas like Flat Top The lunch is 9 95 Sounds like a lot but the portion was large and if you do smaller portions you can make multiple trips for that price The drink menu looked intriging I think it d be a fun date place Some mentioned not seeing a vegetarian protien I believe I saw Tofu but it was in with the veggies not the meat section We tried the chocolate wantons and I thought they were perfect light and flavorful The waiter also recommended the cheesecake Speaking of the waiter he was incredibly attentive My drink was refilled before I even realized I was low 
-UMCCvkh5-uhMdcSp7CrLg Urbana Came here for my friend s birthday I heard great things about this place so I had high expectations Needless to say I was a bit disappointed The pros the hibachi chef was very entertaining and friendly the food was delicious especially the scallops perfectly seared with a golden brown exterior and tender interior The cons small portions for what you pay for the server didn t seem to know the menu at all seemed really frazzled asked him several questions that he didn t know the answer to had to ask for refills on my drink countless times overcharged my friend s credit card by like 40 wtf Overall the food was decent service was not great not impressed 
-uvgDqykZ0stUWp4uX_r8g Urbana I came here for lunch on Friday It was pretty quiet only a couple other people eating I had the chicken quesadilla and what was supposed to be a carne asada taco with no onions Prices were fairly low and the food came rather quickly First off they messed up my order as the taco wasn t carne asada Then when I sent it back and it returned the meat was carne asada but was covered in onions By this point I was over it so I didn t bother to send it back a third time just didn t eat it I was expecting more from this place because of all of the rave reviews To be honest my quesadilla was really oily on the outside and extremely bland It was missing heat spice anything to liven up the taste Overall I wasn t too impressed and doubt I ll be back It just wasn t all that 
-uYNW9LneTUr61Jnj6Lplw Urbana I m not a BBQ fan but this was amazing I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was fantastic Definitely recommend this place 
-V39tbuyV3_ryuaez2vuFQ Urbana I recently moved to chicago after graduating from u of i this spring I have to admit that i m somewhat in a panic about getting my hair cut in the city Despite the abundance of salons in this area i have grown to LOVE ippatsu over the last few years I have gone to Doug throughout my time going to ippatsu and he is absolutely incredible I have never felt so comfortable with someone cutting my hair I could easily tell him to do whatever he wanted and would not feel nervous for a second I would highly recommend the salon and would suggest going to Doug if you re looking for someone fantastic though i know their other stylists are awesome as well Some might complain about the price but i think 40 is a very small price to pay for a perfect hair cut and the confidence you ll have in your stylist I can easily see myself working in trips back to campus just to get a great haircut I m going to miss it 
-VEwlYs3f_2Ui8yyvVMzmA Urbana First class breakfast served in an interesting and inviting atmosphere Ensconsed in an old building in downtown Urbana Courrier Cafe is definitely a cut above the typical restaurants in U of I s hometown We were pleasantly surprised My wife had the Ham and Scram and a side of pumpkin pancakes that were on special The eggs were well cooked and the ham was really tasty It had the right hint of smokines which I thought was particularly pleasant I had the Spanish omlette which as usually happens in gringo joints was billed as hot by our waitress It was merely low medium Generous shots of hot sauce kicked my dish up to the real heat level for me Delicious coffee and really nice bread that made excellent toast was also provided Attentive service but the restaurant only had ten patrons when we were there right at opening so it may not be representative Not worth a special trip to Champaign Urbana but if you are in town or even passing by a slight detour to patronize it is worth it 
-vgrhW_V4BXbmCN2DTEJpA Urbana Most of the reviews here aren t very fair to this establishment It is what it is and if you don t want a sandwich stuffed with different fried foods then you re in the wrong place I ve been here after drinking and it was great Otherwise I only come here when I am experiencing a particular brand of self loathing in which case it is still pretty good The Fat Sorostitute has been my go to for the past several visits If you come during the day while sober the people that work here will be pretty nice and courteous to you If you come at night while drunk they ll be less so I know I couldn t serve drunk people all night without getting a bit mad so I don t blame them Also I suspect the counter is relatively high to keep drunk people from doing something stupid I think this is funny 
-vT8jBj7-QsnRbwE6XtCHA Urbana It s hella convenient it s open 24 7 it houses a Caribou Coffee with free wi fi it has its own free parking lot items are reasonably priced there are always sales and coupons they have a big liquor section really now what more could a college student ask for With the opening of a County Market at Stoughton there really is no need for me to bum rides from friends to Market Place anymore and I never need to worry about running out of milk or toilet paper Plus clubs and other organizations are always advertising promoting here so there s always someone giving away free food or random goodies P 
-W8-CNDSpXjUFEnKDR1HBA Urbana Jarling s a darling J ust so you know this is my 3 frozen custard place Pretty rockin A vailable seating outside Even in November o R edonkulous amount of items on the menu including a bajillion variations of snowstorms like DQ s blizzard or McD s McFlurry L eery of overblended ice cream treats the only downside to my visit was that my snowstorm started melting before I even got it I f you re reading this Nov 22 is the last day Jarling s is open for this season You re too late o N ever too cold to eat frozen custard Why are you open seasonally G ot daily flavors of vanilla chocolate lemon orange and something else S uper smooth frozen custard 
-wc4lMVEukP2OvGCW5HXGg Urbana A great alternative to Cravings It isn t as busy and you will get your food in under 5 minutes The Chicken Chow Fun is some of the best I ve had 
-wIQP8fI3YmLcplnRRumjw Urbana If you are a crazy U of I fan then you have to have the clothes to go with the attitude yes This is not the cheapest place to get your orange and blue on but they do have quality merchandise and a bit different variety than you see at other bookstores They also curiously enough have books here For classes What The Illini fan to whom I am married is 6 6 so it is hard to find Illini gear for him but they at least have an extended size rack here so he has managed to score a few items over the years They also have such cute baby clothes and as my eldest daughter is due in December let s just say I may have gone a little crazy here last Saturday If you come here to buy your Illini wear you might want to hit their special sales on Mom s Weekend homecoming stuff like that Now I didn t do that this last time but I have in the past Oskee Wow Wow get your orange and blue here 
-WqklnHO9XpmH0_kmgjFfQ Urbana Before I even ordered my food I knew I would love it when The Cooking Channel was on one of the TV s at the bar The green chile burger was quite delicious and went down nicely with a really tastey bottled rootbeer My husband ordered The Russell which I liked even more I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner but don t expect a table at peak hours right away it s quite popular The service was excellent no fuss or finesse and fast There were no weird basement smells nor did I feel like I was in a basement It feels like a pub and burger place 
-XTUUgpNYo8E9OXoBmxX_w Urbana I think this place is pretty great We don t buy everything here but things in bulk are really reasonably priced and for some reason their tofu is the best in town How can any tofu be the best It just is Their prepared foods are all excellent may I recommend the asian peanut noodles You can grab some food and go eat out front with a glorious view of the Lincoln Square parking lot or if you are up for a less exciting view or escaping from inclement weather you can sit inside the mall in the empty hallway It s better than nothing Bring your own bags so you don t have to buy one 
-xxr8UjEFYJ97OSfdglkJw Urbana Comcast is one of the worst companies out there I just canceled my service because I m moving and was told that I d be paying a cancellation fee When signing up for the service I was very explicitly told this would not be the case if I was moving Comcast will lie to you to get their way Awful company full of awful useless people The internet service might work fine but the customer service is horrible and the company should be closed due to their shady practices AVOID comcast at all costs 
-X_T47pqhuc3eaoCkXm-Jw Urbana Burnt ends fresh lemonade and a pulled pork sandwich I m in heaven 
-Y9fm-dV95qoZ_a0oVW7SA Urbana NOM This place has great food hands down I have been here on two occasions now and both times it has made my heart sing The flavors are exquisite You get to pick your own sauce which is great and they ll bring you a sample if you re not sure you re going to enjoy one but you think well maybe Get the burnt ends While everything I ve tried has been good the burnt ends are the best thing on the menu What they did to that meat is beautiful artistic completely wonderful simultaneously sinful and heavenly Go here For sure 
-YgBQuGJGuXJIZRerAGnhw Urbana Carly did a great job on my hair A little bit of funk but still professional for work What I really appreciated was how great she was at telling me about the different products I was using suggesting tips on how to take care of my hair and also not assuming I had the money to buy the expensive stuff Great place in Champaign Urbana for the 20 somethings crowd to go for cuts Very welcoming atmosphere and good music playing too 
-YhnjaKlYvUkht9X3EbMkA Urbana Peking Garden is a wonderful place excellent for its variety of interesting dishes and pleasant atmosphere I throughly enjoyed my chile chicken fried chicken with chile peppers and a fiery hot sauce which was the spiciest dish I have ever had in a Chinese restaurant The meal ended with fortune cookies and a plate of succulent oranges The service was great and the prices weren t bad either I definitely recommend this restaurant 
-yjsQpus-dhrLGmMHk93_w Urbana For its size El Charro packs a punch I ve formerly only eaten in the restaurant here which was always tasty I was a quesadilla fiend for a while and they always delivered figuratively not literally Lately I ve been trying to cook my own Mexican food and the grocery section though small had everything I needed the other day corn husks Valentina chiles de rbol and El Milagro tortillas And walking up to the counter with two huge bags of husks the guy behind the counter started a friendly conversation about different kinds of tamales Awesome 
-YNi9f3PmIHIJzZhNb3PbA Urbana I m always a fan of some good barbeque and since moving to Champaign I ve been hearing tons of good things about this place Fairly certain I also saw it had won some Best Barbeque awards for the area My hopes were high but after trying it I was terribly let down The barbeque this place serves reminds me of very average cafeteria style food I ll say I definitely thought the meat was very good I have tried the chicken pork and beef and it has a nice smoked taste to it Unfortunately everything else that makes the sandwich fails The barbeque sauce perhaps ultimately the most important ingredient pretty much is what ruins the sandwich in my opinion Like a lot of other reviews have said the sauce is unduly sweet and extremely watery It almost tastes like drinking liquid sugar in some regards The bread is not much better Sandwiches are literally served on tiny hoagie rolls like the generic ones you buy at the grocery store for 1 Probably the most generic cheap type of bread anyone can afford Sides were also generally unimpressive Baked beans were nothing special and I also had a potato salad side that seriously had almost NO taste to it It tasted like eating raw potatoes All and all definitely a huge let down for me and very sub par barbeque and sides Really a surprise they keep winning the best Barbeque award for the CU area but I guess there s no other competition Sad to say but this was probably one of the worst barbeques I ve ever had 
-ZG3e6NZxZSd7UYlCE6yPg Urbana Went with a large group for a birthday celebration ended up ordering family style Everything was fantastic especially the stick fried tofu and the pork buns Fantastic place to go with a large group but just make sure to bring cash to split the bill Overall the best Chinese food I ve had bar none A bit on the expensive side but well worth the cost 
-Zi8F8qDvSBn2jXLgl94ag Urbana Bella Mia s new location houses its great fashion finds as well as home decor items Though its styles are generally a bit more mature than what a college student would wear I was able to find a couple pairs of shoes as a college student it still has something for everyone The prices are naturally higher than other chain stores but that should be expected when shopping at a boutique When I visited for my first time the staff was incredibly helpful and multiple women helped me find what i was looking for They offer a great deal of higher end clothing items that are hard to find in the C U area The best part about it for me which isn t advertised is that they offer a student discount of 20 a big deal for a college student 
-ZQZI9fjg8OSQ3puBdPw0Q Urbana Great indian food spiced well and not Americanized The naan is fresh and amazing 
-_GryYqhVWFZkaZuW_ugwg Urbana Food and bubble tea aren t consistent Sometimes it s good and sometimes it s bad 
0-f7i185-WXP71E-r49VHw Urbana Quick Good Cheap Pretty large menu They used to have a location on Green street but it wasn t as popular 
00greMBGiIJ7mQF5rSxSIw Urbana I am really torn apart by the Courier Cafe I will go there and it will be amazing all around then the next time I go I will get awful service For example last night I went there with a group of four for dinner and waited 10 minutes to even get our drinks ordered Once the waiter even comes by he doesn t even say hi and is very unfriendly Throughout the meal we do not get refills and barely see the waiter Then once we get our dinner plates he hands us the checks Talk about being rushed out of a place I guess they don t want to sell desert or after dinner drinks This is unfortunate because the food is great The burger are good value and the friend chicken dinner is one of the best around town The milkshakes are the best I have ever had I will refuse to be a regular customer though after my last experience It is now just a place to go once in a great while or for a shake The only reason they got three stars is because of the food otherwise it would be a one 
01owT4bgiF4kZQjV-h6c7g Urbana We dined alfresco on a Sunday evening in June We were the only people outside It was our own private place Our server was on the ball and attentive but not annoying The manicotti in meat sauce was awesome I will seriously get that every time I go Salad was typical as was the g b Wine was decent and reasonably priced I grew up in a very Italian area and I honestly found this food to be up to par 
02ffV9hsAI7tIemC4EW86Q Urbana Four stars for the win El Toro At last a place where I can watch the Pumas eat some decent food joke in Spanish and even have fried ice cream if I m playing gringo tourist I like it And I don t mind taking midwestern friends here It makes me look edgy cuando yo hablo en espanol con la gente Also the alambres were fantastic 
03f8obd2q8EKZQAGFQONLA Urbana It s a cheap meal but it s still overpriced You re literally getting a dried chunk a ramen just like the ones you see at the supermarket Instead of paying 1 for it you ll pay about 5 It comes with ingredients like bok choy and fish balls but not enough to make up for the inflated price I don t know why the rest of the reviewers are excited I could make this stuff in a second Just go to Am Ko and toss everything into some hot water and start charging people 5 What a business model 
03npOrUQKj4AIvhwl6K2xQ Urbana I am writing strictly about a lunch experience The service was a bit mediocre but the place has a bright and interesting atmosphere The honey turkey wrap was delicious and the portions were quite filling 
03_3cIPdwDK_ixdCQRh_5A Urbana I like custard Jarlings sells custard Therefore I like Jarlings So it s just a standard custard shack except that it s not a shack it s a huge building I m not sure what they are doing with the industrial sized kitchen area I was watching the hustle and bustle behind the counter and the custard machine is wild There s a big pipe slowly crapping out forearm sized ropes of custard into a stainless steel bin Then the workers scoop the custard out of the bin Fascinating I didn t order a baseball helmet sundae but I did notice that they have the helmets of every team That s cool 
04lK95psN_P9gA3ViEOibQ Urbana Hands down the most underrated place on campus Everything they offer is at least good while their gyros are nothing short of amazing for Chambana at least The jazz shows are a nice touch the prices are very reasonable and the staff is always friendly One of my favorite places to spend a break whether it s between classes or during work It doesn t offer enough food on the level of their gyros to warrant a five star rating but it deserves a strong four 
05593cfGxhCmRms5Umag4A Urbana To be fair I do know the folks that run this place BUT I would love Manolo s anyway I think they have a creative menu not standard ingredients in their empanadas and pizza Very large pizza slices and they always make it fresh You can buy their stuff when you are in the Canopy Club too I ve turned several people on to this place and I truly miss it now that I m gone I think it is really affordable and a nice change to the usual pizza and campus food scene 
06rMYMIKxRf8h4Olgog8rA Urbana I ve only eaten at a Taco Bell once since 2005 and it was at this one last year I got food poisoning Awesome 
06YdMcY-c4gW3_06SinleA Urbana Apparently this is THE place to go for custard and I agree Jarlings has the largest flavored custard menu including fan favorites like vanilla chocolate strawberry and I believe orange They also offer a weekly specialty flavor I m still not the biggest frozen custard fan hence the three stars but Jarling s nonetheless is still satisfying They offer sundaes scoops concretes custard with mixed in candy or flavors i e they make a grasshopper concrete Jarling s also has a classic 1950s ice cream drive in spot feel to it There s limited seating inside picnic tables outside a drive thru window ample parking and high school kids in tye dyed t shirts taking your order I also suggest getting a pint or quart to go It s much cheaper than eating an order there 
073eSi-Epn3bY1yJk5U53w Urbana Courier Cafe milkshakes are the BEST IN THE WORLD Seriously their milkshakes are to die for It s awesome because they ll give you one glass plus a metal cup of the stuff that didn t fit in the glass Perfect for sharing or for splurging Every single milkshake I ve had here has been thick creamy and full of hand dipped goodness One of my favorites peanut butter and fudge In terms of food their salad bar is always a good choice fresh and lots of variety and I really like their chicken pesto pita Whatever you order though make sure you get a milkshake 
07JPJWx_mtoLa36joOjeJQ Urbana i go somewhere else now since i am in chicago but the haircuts best in town and they ALL listen to my babbling but the eyebrows i don t think it can compare to anywhere else i ve gone if i tell you who did them it doesn t matter she s now in florida cutting hair in 80 degree weather while i am still freezing my ass off here for the last 24 years of my young life boo it s ok i will be strong 
08D0ZP5263DtTFfGepFfWg Urbana I ve been going to Kopi for a couple years for coffee on occasion but just last Sunday was the first time I got food there Their coffee is always good from the local Columbia Street Roastery if I remember the name correctly They serve it in pint glasses which I always found a bit odd I got a Brie and turkey open face sandwich and pasta salad a dollar extra option for about 7 50 total plus my coffee The sandwich was good and the price wasn t terrible for what I got it also came with fresh fruit This is good easy to prepare food since they don t have a real big kitchen However I would recommend stopping in one day for a light lunch since everything I got was good Only downside was I waited a little bit for the sandwich though they were very busy 
08KhUEGfGna4QQBuha85Aw Urbana I have had far better Greek food at other places and there are better diners but nothing matches the combination of good food and absolutely top notch service that you find at Papa George s Of course This is Papa George s We ain t no chain the owner said when I asked for a small menu substitution I feel if your e going for teh Greek Diner combo you can t go wrong with the American Gyros French fries and if you have room later baklava sundaes ice cream sundaes with baklava crumbs atop them Reflect on how unhealthily delicious that is Sunday brunch is also tasty although perhaps not exceptional Again the service tips it from a 4 star to a 5 star review Additionally they have a happy hour on Thursdays with 2 martinis unfortunately they re about as good as you can expect for 2 Don t fail to check out their weekly 5 lunch specials though THOSE are fantastic Can you tell I have a soft spot for Papa George cuz I do 
09dtLobNps73V3WjF8chkw Urbana Mike Molly s seems like a decent place to grab a drink with friends but it didn t strike me as being anything special I liked sitting outside on a beautiful night and appreciated that I could hear my friends over the music I was also appreciative of the staff member who asked a guy who was being obnoxious and bothering us to leave To me this place was incredibly cheap for the selection and quality of beer they offered but then again I m used to drinking in Chicago and paying for it accordingly And heads up apparently there is a cover charge a whopping 1 on nights without live music Makes up for the cheap beer I guess 
09fiFK_XZy72ORV-fx0kiw Urbana It s a place that is easy to both love and hate On one hand they have some unique academic programs and great professors but you ll probably have to slog through lots sub par classes before you get the good classes Business is one of the better colleges but you wouldn t know if from the lower level classes My least favorite class ever was an upper level econ econ is technically in LAS even though business people spend plenty of time in the department class that was taught by a TA who not only didn t speak very good English but who also gave really harsh tests The first test average was a 64 and there was no curve Grading is harsh here Lots of people repeat classes I also have plenty of bad things to say about accounting and finance classes but it depends on the class I guess LAS is the catch all college that gets shafted a lot Many of my lectures were too big and in auditoriums were literally falling apart Contrast that with the much funded engineering college s glittering shiny collection of brand new giant buildings Oh well ACES my college is a bit of a catch all college as well but some of the majors are quite small I ve had my smallest and favorite classes in ACES For development and other niche economics specialties this is the place to be and undergrads get lots of attention It also has top notch programs in other aggy stuff ranging from food science to animal science I adore most of my professors I have had in this college The only downside is that ACES has tended to attract some less than bright students in the past and has some programs within it in need of reform but I m sure that is true in many UIUC colleges I recommend ACES but only if you are truly interested in the curricula I would note that I skipped all gen eds and a lot of ugly giant lower level classes thanks to APs and placements tests If you can do that it is worth it because the upper level classes are where you can really enjoy academics The lower level classes seem to be purposefully soul crushing with harsh curves unintelligible TAs and professors who just read off powerpoints 101 classes are where learning goes to die I basically did well on them by memorizing lectures off flashcards a sad way to learn if you ask me Don t be afraid to switch classes if you get a bad feeling on the first day I did that a lot and it was worth it for the English speaking TAs I am personally not a fan of the Greek system which welds a little too much power here The drunken anti intellectual environment can be stifling if you don t find a niche Allen Hall is the place to be for anti Greeks hippies outsiders and it has the bonus of small lower level classes often taught by people who actually care Avoid the isolated residence halls like PAR and FAR go six pack only if you are Greek ish and ISR is the place to be for engineers and other assorted people who want to live near the science and engineering buildings Dorm food is a mixed bag it s mostly just inexcusably bad but most people don t seem to notice because they think fries and hot dogs acceptable lunch I like the Chambana area even if it has some minor annoyances Ill kept frat houses and a bizarre lack of on campus grocery stores mar it but otherwise it was easy for me to find restaurants to eat at and assorted drunk free places to hang out However I can think of about ten major cities where I d rather live The weather here is horrible In the summer you scald and in the winter you freeze so pack your snowboots and your short shorts 
09KkJt7SlxuOVRrQRDlSUA Urbana Good Things My Pistachio Passion Fruit cupcake The cupcake was good and all but it was the passion fruit whipped topping adorned with crunchy salty pistachios that pushed it over the edge into Amazingville At 2 50 I m more than sold The Lemongrass Pear cocktail They use Grey Goose vodka which at 7 cocktail is a nice deal It was a wonderful drink refreshing and just a little sugary Very complementary to my cupcake too The plates they use are beyond adorable Meh Things Raspberry Dessert Wine Sounds good but isn t It s like drinking sweetened cough syrup The Mexican Hot Chocolate cupcake was good but wasn t on the same plane of existence as the pistachio cupcake The cake itself tasted like a snickerdoodle cookie and the whipped topping tasted mostly like cinnamon It wasn t bad but I think The Boy was looking more for chocolate and less for cinnamon They had one person working the counter at 8 on a Friday night It was probably about as busy as Cakes on Walnut gets why only one person She was taking orders making drinks getting the cupcakes and just about everything else As a result there was a lot of wait time involved for people in line and tables were not bussed properly The ambiance was a bit iffy It was like trying to be pretentious and indie quirky all at the same time All told though I m a fan Next time I ll skip buying the booze and go next door to the Blind Pig have a lot of beer and then go get some delicious inexpensive cupcakes To go 
09mEv36hFDkyAQgxqRsamw Urbana Barbara altered my wedding dress on somewhat short notice about 5 weeks out She took the sides in at the top for me and it fit perfectly after one visit so I would highly recommend her if you just need something fitted I am quite petite however and even after two visits the dress was too long and the bustle was dragging on the floor and one spot was kind of left out of the bustle party altogether which she was not concerned about even though it looked pretty awful Barbara s response when I tried on the dress for the last time was well you don t have your shoes on and I did all five and half inches of them All night at the wedding reception people kept asking me if I wanted to bustle my dress and I had to reply that it was actually already bustled as myself and others trampled on it in dance mode But at least the top stayed up perfectly and really that is the number one concern I think In conclusion YES for Barbara if you need something taken in If you need a long dress shortened or bustled give yourself enough time for 3 4 visits I am sure she could rock it out had I given her more than two attempts to shorten and bustle 
09UJun3cZzpB-hoiW_3U5w Urbana I spent 2 50 on lunch yesterday and was almost too full to eat dinner that night Got the Thai Mei Doodle only 1 for the grand opening with chicken pickled carrots sprouts and mushrooms At 75 for the chicken topping I wasn t expecting all that much meat but there was tons And super delicious Veggies were super fresh and plentiful as well It was a perfect lunch for a cold day It s tucked away behind Insomnia Cookies so don t miss it 
0A1Rdj2GnkDTFc7DI97PQA Urbana Every time I go they do not disappoint 
0aHksTbYtrvGwkASmb0Wbg Urbana Mia Za s The hell I m pretty sure that when I was in college 03 07 this place was just plain old Za s But that was back in the DAY back when shit was REAL It s true this place has no personality but the food is serviceable and I like building my own pizza salad sandwich pasta dish The pizza crust is super thin and crispy and I like that the salads are ENORMOUS The pasta I could live without I don t know why but it kind of reminded me of pasta they might serve in the dorms GOOD dorm pasta yes but still dorm pasta Maybe that makes sense only in my head 
0ALfpnFVyqVsbh9Com6eKw Urbana What one would consider fine dining especially considering the fact we re talking about Champaign Bacaro s boasts of an extensive wine selection and the best of traditional Italian cuisine We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer and because I wasn t feeling very adventurous chose the oven roasted chicken as my entre Overall I found both these dishes a little too salty maybe the chef was just having an off night The portions are modest but you would probably expect a little more for the price you re paying They did have a decent cheesecake and the check came out with a couple yummy chocolate chip meringues but overall I guess I was a little disappointed In consensus with what many others have said service was very attentive but I felt it was almost to the point of pretentiousness Based on this experience alone I would most likely not recommend Bacaro s nor dine here again but I really don t want to dislike this establishment and would like to come back again sometime in the future and give it another chance Until then I say stick with Radio Maria 
0As3BzJEUkA2YOFUQpkLcg Urbana I am absolutely not a coffee person but I picked up a few bags for my brother last time I was in town While I waited why did I have to wait so long This is why four stars and not five I tried a sample and oh my goodness if I were gonna get hooked on coffee this is the place that could do it Of course I still needed a lot of cream sugar because that s how I roll but I suspect that s exclusively my issue Highly recommended coffee coming from a non coffee drinker My brother the real coffee drinker in the family still has our parents ship it to him periodically now that he s living in LA as well so that s gotta say something 
0BDWDjL_xPlD9vBbREpDmg Urbana It s nice to have a big spacious facility full of reasonably priced fine arts performances If you don t live in the city normally you really need to visit this place because you re not likely to find anywhere where you can find great performances at these prices in your hometown 
0bSeJdmPxCLgHO9fP0wu5w Urbana Escobar s is easily one of my favorite date spots I have been here three times spring fall and winter The ambiance is romantic and cozy although it does get crowded due to the restaurant s popularity and for other good reasons too The servers are really nice and the food is delicious My only qualm is the hostess she has always seemed to be disorganized or overwhelmed every time that we have visited and does not handle it very well Other than that Escobar s is great 
0btxGxpdLnVtgZl_njwo3w Urbana The phone number has been disconnected 
0BvQDUTI74VzwzPJmff4Jw Urbana Second visit Is enjoyable I think due to the unique menu and the ambiance of the old newspaper office Rueben and onion rings are good Wife had the turkey club and both shared the potato skins appetizer All good and will go back as there appears many more items to try 
0bxjHj_Rl3c3z-AvC43Dzg Urbana Been here once for lunch once for dinner and once late night Honestly the crowds were biggest during lunch definitely unusual for a campus bar The food was okay typical bar food but Legend s is better 2 stars for the food drink and party atmosphere 4 stars for the fact that it is CLEAN pretty and well decorated so a 3 over all 
0C9nRqOj0ZGeLxLEzkwtZg Urbana Not bad Got the 1 3 Texas something or another burger with bacon lettuce tomato and grilled onions Portions were huge swimming in grease The fries were alright but not the best crispy but not too much potato The white bread buns were cold with all the other toppings the texture clashed with the grilled burger and crispy toppings I wished they would toast the bun slightly to make it fit It s basically an okay Five Guys says my friend It isn t the best burger around I was hoping for better meat and a big honking patty over two stacked slim slices of meat I gave it three since 11 dollars for the full meal is a lot for just an alright burger I will try it again and recommend it to anyone who wants to try that upscale burger joint 
0Cdn61Ws4QnbEuiJMj_D2Q Urbana My favorite pizza place in the whole wide world I wish they would ship via FedEx I live in California but every time I am in C U I make a bee line for Papa Dels 
0DCfByHB1SvM1bIjiW6E2w Urbana I bought my wedding gown from Ducky s and I just want to thank all of them for helping me have such a wonderful day The sales associate who helped me was extremely friendly and professional and I especially liked how she didn t show me any gowns outside my price range She also took my figure and coloring into consideration and suggested gowns I would not normally have tried In fact she found My Dress for me I wouldn t have tried it on but she told me that it would look beautiful on me and lo and behold she was right I also loved the fact that she didn t pressure me or try to rush me into making a decision Alterations were great too they have a wonderful seamstress there who takes the time to get your measurements right and does everything to perfection My gown fit perfectly on the big day Ducky s has code names for all their wedding gowns so if you re looking for a gown by a specific designer this isn t the place to go because they won t tell you until your dress is bought and paid for I personally couldn t have cared less about who designed my dress so this wasn t an issue for me As with all bridal shops avoid them on weekends as they re packed You will get much better service if you go during the day on a weekday Make sure to make an appointment if you want to try anything on and as with any bridal shop accessories such as veils tiaras shoes guest books etc are all hideously overpriced eBay is a wonderful source for wedding accessories Thank you so much Ducky s for all you did to help make my wedding day special 
0Dcs_JH7He66Gs3tktyL6A Urbana Poorest customer service I ve ever seen in not just the restaurant industry but in any service Manager was unbelievably rude Will never go back next time I m in Champaign and hope nobody else makes the mistake of going here 
0Dl9sLqP3CwKbUgX_WVVTQ Urbana Good atmosphere but the food is overpriced and midiocre I had a collection of appetizers at the bar that were not large enough portions We were ignored by the bartender for quite a long time as well and the place was almost empty 
0DLsB3av7W93u4O9FR_4sw Urbana I am rating the food Not the bar Let s say I take a thin ground beef patty and take a mallet and pound the crap out of it so that it s shape isn t even round any more That is their Backdraft Burger Don t even try to order a medium rare one They are all cooked the same like a fast food joint Was disappointed with their burger As far as the bar environment I would give that three stars 
0DVz4PBO4TCtD2_Tl8jcZw Urbana I wasn t expecting to taste great barbecue in Illinois but Black Dog surprised me I enjoyed the smoked chicken made with local free range chicken I love that Black Dog uses local ingredients The food is delicious the service was great too 
0eIGvk870P2IEKXG3n3iew Urbana It s a chain But I like it Their chicken caesar wrap is only 370 calories and it s pretty filling They serve pizza and paninis too Great for a quick bite Anyway I have to go back and try their other things 
0EL-9OGj0HyRGIZ7wb3WGA Urbana Bacaro is a restaurant that I would reserve for a special occasion or just to treat yourself to something a little different My favorite is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars and for an additional 25 you can get some awesome wines highly recommended The courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing presentation and you won t go home hungry I ve noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste actually they re consistently salty to me but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing sauces and the desserts so delicious the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly I honestly don t know a better way to start the week if you have a bad case of the mondays treat yourself to some bacaro and your spirits will be lifted I have gone several times and enjoyed several of the menu items and a few market nights i hear they re introducing an occasional VEGETARIAN market menu and i have never been disappointed The service is great and they are very attentive Some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation but overall they are a pleasant and fun to talk to group If you ask them a question and they don t know the answer they are probably equally curious to know the answer as well meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef I think you definitely get what you pay for and for a city like champaign bacaro is definitely a lovely gem 
0f0NVjGTScuY8mpV56WZQQ Urbana Jack rules The pastries here are so delicious and sometimes too beautiful to eat but you WILL eat them You are weak Jack is a fastidious baker and expects the best from his staff Very intense guy high standards but with an amazing sense of humor A nice little shop Excellent bread too 
0FdCznOTQNDm-AD8pB0qPw Urbana I agree way nicer decor than the vaguely scummy looking one in Champaign The price is right but the food is extremely hit or miss the fried tofu tends to be leathery and everything I ve ever ordered that came with a non curry sauce has managed to be both bland and cloyingly sweet The curries make up for it but make sure you order it about twice as spicy as you think you should 
0ffY1gUKtAch_uyIwl_mSA Urbana I didnt think that I would find a mexican food place that is this great on my college campus I have been there many times and havent been disappointed once The food is great The service is great they know everything there is to know about their food and they are great at helping you choose your meal Service is fast If you are ever in champaign Maize is a must 
0FQwVXYGZO-M1CSt0dLc0A Urbana I was hesitant to come here but it is super close to my fiance s work so we decided to go I ordered a side salad and my fiance and I split an appetizer of nachos They were really salty and just well not good My salad was fine but I had asked the waitress to put the dressing on the side and instead it was slathered everywhere We also split a burger which was decent but very very heavy I think I maybe had 3 bites of it My partner also ordered a drink special a Long Island Iced Tea that came back to us blue They said it was the Illini special though I have no idea how seeing how our colors are orange and blue and not light bluish green Bottom Line Save your money and support a local restaurant instead 
0fYiVIZTdL1-qT9LykehbQ Urbana Great selection of bulk goods some interesting Illinois based cheeses not just the yummy ones from Prairie Fruits Farm good deli case 
0Gg-EE0lINSY01GB23psNg Urbana This is CU s top notch coffee shop They have delicious hot and cold drinks and wonderfully fresh pastries If you want to get some hardcore studying done this place has good study seatings outlets galore and a diverse enough menu to provide sustenance Though I am an undergrad myself the distance from campus means there aren t too many of my kind here and it s probably better that way 
0H0V6Oqrag1TBbns-Kytxg Urbana From the very thoughtful and extensive beer list to great decor and a staff second to none Quality delivers This is a place where you can sit at the bar with a friend when it is slow and quietly converse or move to a table with a group when the night gets going Middle aged couples on nights out sit next to early twenty somethings who never went home and mellowed thirty somethings de stressing from work There are darts there is Pac Man there is a library with Nabokov tomes Simply put This place is Quality 
0hnG1Zxkmgrv-SiLPwloaQ Urbana Just tried the Prairie Fire restaurant this evening I went thinking that it would be TGI Prairie Fire occupies the same space where TGI Friday s used to be Since I was already there I ook a quick peak at the menu before deciding to sit down Compared to TGI the number of menu items are very limited it seemed decent enough and so a friend and I decided to give it a whirl I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla as an appetizer Pretty average nothing really to rave about But I figured that you couldn t get too fancy with a quesadilla For the main course I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and my friend ordered the Southwest Chicken Cajun Pasta The bed of rice with the Teriyaki Chicken was okay but what was supposed to be Teriyaki Chicken was grilled chicken sans teriyaki sauce Not even the smallest hint of Teriyaki When I requested a side of teriyaki sauce apparently they didn t have any and only used a marinade Anyway I was not at all pleased with the Teriyaki Chicken I would give it a 0 5 stars My friend ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta This was also nothing to rave about I can make better at home Food wise it was a pretty lackluster experience Not worth the 45 Prices didn t really make up for the lack of quality either The one star is for the fairly decent service 
0I16FnUEGV442FsbaYBdhg Urbana I d give it 4 stars for the margaritas and the service Our server was really nice and attentive The food though has much to be desired Last night we went there and I got chicken tacos They were so horrible that I only took one bite My friend got the same thing and she also didn t eat more than one bite They were that bad The chicken tasted like it was canned The chips are good and the salsa isn t too bad either They re generous with the chips and keep them coming good thing too since that s what I ate for dinner since my tacos stunk Good place to go if you re just looking for ritas and chips 
0i1IVqxLtKleDOCixWwmVw Urbana The over baking issues seem for the most part to be resolved Yay Their only remaining fault as I see it is that they don t have the best sandwich selection and rarely have meatless sandwiches They used to make this amazing egg salad sandwich that was wonderfully flavored with the perfect amount of fresh dill but I haven t seen it in over a year If they bring that back and start making the fresh mozzarella and pesto sandwiches more often I ll happily up them to five stars Man I hope the folks at Mirabelle are reading this 
0i3R0d5ZLLIPF6GghfudIA Urbana I go to this library to study This is a great library because it s big it has a lot of tables and it s QUIET I hate going to study at libraries that have disrespectfully loud people who go there 
0ibGwodYjhhCXpZCR3iAoQ Urbana The first time I ate here I wasn t too impressed but when I ate here the other day I was blown away The beef stroganoff crepe was out of this world the taste of red wine and mushrooms was ever so slight yet in perfect proportion to the overall taste And the coffee was probably the most delicious cup of joe I ve ever had The mrs loves the baguette french toast and the bloody marys are outstanding as well The smoked salt that is used to flavor the butter is also spectacular There is an amazing amount of flavor packed into each grain of salt Very cool Overall I highly recommend Carmon s for breakfast 
0iIWyxnfrl5XhzxBPgjQpQ Urbana I am pretentious and I love pretension Carmon s offers pretension and delicious taste all at once I came in for brunch this morning and loved the atmosphere the overdone fin de siecle details and the crepes I had a delightful buckweat crepe filled with eggs and bacon that was far more classy than a savoury breakfasty thing had any right being I was also incredibly nervous as I was sitting with a Harvard professor and talking about Woodrow Wilson or perhaps just from the very strong double espresso they whipped up here Speaking of coffee if you get a chance order a cup of regular filter coffee They ll pour you a refill from a ginormous metal coffee urn that looks like it was filched from Scheherezade s palace No seriously it does Or from Toulouse LaTrec at least the John Leguizamo version Well worth a trip for brunch 
0ImO0vrAJL8_tm9vuC4-Rg Urbana I love the daily specials I eat here every time I can which isn t often because they are only open for weekday lunches I think Such delicious food and definitely a worthwhile place to give my 5 for lunch too 
0iS2uSyryVQ30Ij82idX4g Urbana 20 000 watts of awesome Note This review only applies to August 2006 May 2007 Whatever may have transpired at this establishment before or after that time has not been taken into consideration This time period is considered by the majority of scholars to be the Golden Era of Kams This review also applies to the lesser known Koms 
0iTD1eGrc_Wk-DC7smoeGA Urbana First off the food was fine Nothing I can t get at the other two made to order burrito places nearby but good But in a world with so many burrito choices I won t be going back to Pancheros The service was kind of slow but they did just open so we ll give them a pass They didn t have enough food prepared which forced us to wait while they made small quantities that they were bound to run out of again soon They said that s what happens when you cook fresh I dunno maybe I m in the minority here but I don t really mind if my cooked veggies sit in a warming pan for a few hours Another thing about the food they are VERY skimpy on the scoops I ve never noticed this at Chipotle or Q doba both of those places ladle it on like they re fattening you up for market But this place was seriously measuring out very scant scoops of rice beans cheese everything I got a burrito bowl and it was maybe half full And yet I paid the same price as my husband who got a burrito which has a tortilla that the bowl doesn t include What s up with that The parking here pretty much sucks if the place is at all busy and you enter through the Jimmy Johns drive up lane so have fun maneuvering around the cars waiting in line The shared building with Jimmy Johns is just odd the signs for entering and exiting the parking lot only say Jimmy Johns so it makes it seem like this place is a little tacked on Nope won t be back 
0jABGiuImcNxjzc3vAIwbQ Urbana I hope the pig is not too blind and can see its way to friendlier service Roll into this place from down the street a tad where friendly humans are behind the bar without a tude and you might get the same bummer I have most times I visit Someone else used the term pompous and I can second that Surly would work too And it doesn t have to be crowded for you to be invisible as you wistfully look at the beers wanting to grab another so you can head back to one of the cool hide away tables with your friends What everyone else is saying about great beer selection cool pub appearance sans the warm human hospitality coziness lack of flat scream teevees etc that s all true The place has a lot going for it But my two cents to the staff if you hate people maybe bartending is not your gig Oh yea when I have my change sitting on the bar next to my beer don t slide by to grab it like a snake grabbing an egg then slither off to stand arms crossed staring at the wall Maybe that was your tip maybe that was what I was going to use for my next beer Sheesh That s not pub manners no ma am 
0jALHCBseiEy0rFy-OW6dw Urbana I am not a HUGE fan of smoked foods Most of my experiences with smoked meats ended up leaving an ash tray taste in the mouth or really dry meat But at Black Dog I LOVED IT My husband cleared his plate faster then I have ever seen and said straight away that his food was the BEST smoked pulled pork he had ever had I had the beef brisket and damn it was good Can t beat the price tag I mean really If I remember correctly our bill was less then 15 
0jw0-HRQr2vA2-vjwghsjg Urbana super modern feel yet still very comfortable my friend was having her wedding ceremony reception at this hotel and the front desk was more than willing to accommodate a few of us that were in the wedding party for an early check in the rooms were clean and the beds were super comfortable with the standard hotel amenities the shower design is a little funny in some of the rooms there is no door just a glass window that covers half of the shower space luckily the shower head is one of those waterfall types so you don t have to worry about water getting all over the bathroom they have free wi fi and they also give you vouchers for free coffee and snacks at the cafe downstairs one thing that would make it better would be 24hr room service overall it was a fantastic stay if i ever find myself in champaign again i wouldn t hesitate to stay here 
0kEPMEjCXXlDMzkQ_Xdbdw Urbana This place is awful The only thing that bamba s has is that it is open late enough that if you are drunk you may eat it Just NEVER during the day I got massive food poisoning from here The only reason it gets two stars is because it really is a part of campus nostalgia Everyone knows bambas 
0kHVu5I-woG58zod3_JKyA Urbana My favorite Indian restaurant The food is fantastic and the service is great 
0kl4wPxs1pMddshecXxkag Urbana Wow this place has really changed now they occupy two spaces instead of one One space is for formal dining while the other is more casual and laid back We sat across a huge purple bar The menu was much different than I remembered Instead of entrees like half chickens with grilled plantains etc they offered Tapas which we didn t mind at all In fact we love Tapas The best Tapas we ordered was the vegetarian paella I wished the paella was served on a big platter like in Spain but it was just in a tiny side dish which I understand is part of the whole Tapas mentality but still I wished they d offer it on the menu as a main dish The margarita I ordered was spot on Not to strong not to watered down And their prices are extremely reasonable We spent 47 00 without tip for six tapas two margaritas and one dessert which we shared I still love Radio Maria s but I like the decor on the older side better 
0Kn1D6f80JbeHTiGnduflw Urbana After a long work day my friend J and I needed some booze and sustenance and she came up with yet another Champaign winner Interior is stylish minimal and dark Our booth was large and comfy Our waiter was knowledgeable and just friendly enough Can quickly become pricey if you stay a while and dive into the small plates and drinks I was overwhelmed by the drink menu and ended up going with my old standby the dirty Martini My first one with organic corn vodka which made for a smooth sipping drink Loved it J tried two different drinks so I got to try them too over the course of our dinner both of which were delicious and pleasantly spiked with liquor We tried two different apps the Beer Battered Bacon and the House Olives our 2nd choice when we were told they d just run out of the deviled eggs The bacon was not greasy at all and the maple chipotle drizzle was the perfect topper The olives were meh just not necessary and I don t think my opinion was swayed too much by the fact that I really really wanted those deviled eggs Next up a la carte soup I went with the Beer Cheddar soup which was close to great with discernible beer and cheese flavors J chose the soup du jour Cream of Asparagus excellent fresh asparagus flavor here Both soups were wonderfully creamy Bowls were decent sized for 5 My entree was a Thai shrimp and noodle dish I m a sucker for coconut curry sauces Nice amount of shrimp but no noticeable spice to the dish A bit of a disappointment J s beer brined double pork chop was an amazing dish not to mention huge Perfectly pink pork We parked in a nearby parking garage as the lot across the street was full I would return and try everything new other than my Martini 
0kr30u-okifEGetnjNeWGg Urbana We went for an early Saturday night dinner drawn in by new fine dining in the area which is limited and the promise of local farm to table style We are huge fans of many local farm efforts which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall and now Big Grove Tavern First the food from a foodie perspective Fresh product well selected and well cared for The flavors of the natural food are highlighted The preparation is often minimally invasive The technique is classic French The flavor profile is quiet My partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder For example the deviled eggs a pre starter have yolks mixed with peas We would suggest adding an acid note perhaps a pickle It was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks a feature at BGT The flavor of the night was white truffle oil and you could taste the oil That was a real win For starters my partner had the chili and cornbread and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb I think mine was better really delicious with rich deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through The farmstyle whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch The cornbread was a bit too refined it needed more crust and less cake more corn flavor and less cafe baked good sweetness The chili was savory but mild no real taste of chilis The entree and dessert courses were both very good especially dessert My partner had the short ribs which were beautifully medium rare not a hint over or under I had the roast chicken with dumplings which was amazingly good Crisp skin moist and flavorful meat with a delicious herb broth under Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still not at all cooked out The portions seemed just right not too much and not too little For dessert my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme Both were really superb refined flavorful rich balanced Nothing fussy just satisfaction in every bite with very good coffee on the side they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery a fine choice The food is not bold Or experimental Or imaginative But it is good very good much better I thought in terms of technique than Carmon s Bistro It s clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending People who don t necessarily like a chi chi dining experience will enjoy the food and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless Second the decor and atmosphere I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for although the dark colors dominate a little too much despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options BGT has a chic young vibe somewhere between casual and serious Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling black wire cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area outdoor party lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks one off note the planks have lumber yard stamps which may be a bit too low end for what they were going for fairly inexpensive light wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs if a bit flimsy and booth upholstery I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior There s seating outside too if you re a smoker or don t mind getting it second hand Third cost Yes yes it s on the expensive side BGT is fine dining not family dining I won t be eating here every night either Of course any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree rather than getting the whole shebang I d guess for dinner that this would run you 20 25 tops But if you have a deeper pocket that night the whole shebang here could run you 100 with tip for two and you still won t feel cheated The value is here given the quality of experience Fourth service BGT has a young eager service staff They took good care of us and every other table I could see From beginning to end we enjoyed our time here 
0LBiCH6ScF9_8KjkvSplhQ Urbana One of my fave go to places after a night out on Green St Sometimes waiting in line was even more fun than going out made friends in line saw people throwing up passing out getting in fights Never go in the daytime though the only respectable time to go is when the bars close and you re craving Mexican food Two words SUPER NACHOS Steak is the best They put a bunch of toppings on there it s well worth the money to get the super nachos YUM The best part is the CHEESE it s this delicious white melty cheese they plop on top If it weren t for the cheese we would never go to La Bamba s 
0LmegR3OkJdGKACd0vGvUw Urbana Like much in life you get out of UIUC what you put in Can you have a mediocre education with annoying poor TAs never talk to a prof never leave the dorm I guess so but that wouldn t be much fun I earned a BA and an MS from UIUC Yes the grad level is a whole different world from the undergrad but I still got a lot out of my undergrad experience I learned to have confidence and stand out from a crowd learned a lot had great experiences even learned from some bad ones met the love of my life and managed to pay off my student loans way before my private school friends had made a dent Champaign Urbana you either love it or you don t It isn t Chicago and it isn t the suburbs I m still here so obviously I love it It isn t for everyone but then again I tried living up north and that wasn t for me Don t know if people thinking about college will read this review but if so give UIUC a good solid look It can be big and faceless if you let it but that s a challenge for you to overcome and learn how to be an adult an academic aw heck I m sounding all schmaltzy Good school Go 
0mN1Gms9tD-Zo1QLm6gmqw Urbana After about two slices your stomach is going to be tapped but you ll still reach for a third slice Be careful over eating here is commonplace This is really good Chicago style pizza especially being so far away from Chicago Has a crisp crust soft gooey melty cheese flavorful sauce tender meat Definitely the place to get your pizza fix 
0n7M9z_CIEpu0KQi4WyOcQ Urbana People come here for the bubble tea and hotpot Those are OK but the rest of the food is wildly inconsistent A lot of the food I ve ordered has had an off taste The bubble tea and hotpot would make up for it but they are also quite rude here They won t explain basic things and there have been many instances of people I know getting kicked out because they had finished their food when there were tables free 
0N7nrpO4cNGBYbDp7Ap1YA Urbana My date secured us a reservation here for Valentines Day Pretentious Server was snooty bar man was snooty The patrons also the same Crammed seating It was crazy expensive I understand local farm products different menus blah blah blah but in Central Illinois Seriously 28 for a chicken leg No thank you The prices were a turnoff and the food was OK maybe we picked the wrong dishes The whole time my date and I were staring at this couple that did the at the time 98 person tasting menu one YOUNG lady and a very old man and they were a riot so I guess we had fun watching them Other then that Meh 
0nNaLuBxGOnhgSNFMD181w Urbana After reading the other reviews I was excited to try the DevaCut with Jake but I was pretty much afraid to walk through the door of this place In truth the experience was great The salon is full of a number of young hip looking people but no one seemed mean or rude and I am about plain jane as they get I think hip ness is more a sign of the fact they are continuing to learn their craft and stay up on current trends Jake is super nice and approachable as other reviews mentioned He did talk to me as he styled my hair about what I could do to achieve the same style at home He also talked to me about how curly hair is different than straight hair and needs to be treated differently He seemed very knowledgable He said that he and two of his fellow stylists Doug and Rebecca actually trained with the author of Curly Girl and co owner of the Devachan salon From the cut I walked out of there with it s apparent that Jake knows his stuff I actually have a haircut that I can manage on my own without any complex styling routine My hair looks great has nice volume and frames my face better Most importantly it works with and accentuates my naturally curly hair If you have curly hair I absolutely recommend the DevaCut If you can get it with Jake at Ippatsu even better It s seriously one of the best hair cuts I have ever had P S I HATE to spend money especially on haircuts I believe the extra expense if worth every penny 
0omRADihiWW18egGN_3vxw Urbana This is a place that is fun to go to if you just left the bars and have the munchies The food is okay oily not that great tasting either The employees seem a little disgruntled I have seen people bring work here and eat I don t actually understand why It needs to be a lot brighter for me to come here 
0osa4GRW8rUbUF5gFDE0kQ Urbana If it s possible to have fantasies about food It would certainly involve Pokey Stix I have been hooked to this place since 2004 For all the damage its done to my arteries and heart I still make a point to make a pit stop when I cross Champaign Urbana The Pepperoni Rolls are are gooey with love and awesomeness but those pokey stix are the crack that keep me coming back Please expand to Chicago We have enough fat college kids here that will keep you in business for centuries I heart Gumby s 
0pMMYvmTJlA4AK05TTv0_w Urbana Ursa did a fabulous job fixing a horrible hair cut that I got at another salon in the area She was friendly and kind and was able to turn my vague instructions into a flattering hair cut in record time I will definitely return 
0PmuB9Gh8HBuyn2K-QCEKg Urbana This place is only good for picking up dumb underage girls Not worth it 
0q0B8Vo1vEl-1EgPsESuUQ Urbana I like the layout of CPL Only concern is that the internet is awful I also got yelled at for sitting cross legged on the chairs The tables are nice I love sitting next to the big glass windows because the natural light is really nice 
0Q9zwx6DUlB6htkliT5eNw Urbana Yes this is ramen Instant ramen But it is OH SO SATISFYING Seriously I come here at least once every 1 2 weeks I crave it Long run and need electrolytes RAMEN cure Itsy bitsy hangover RAMEN cure Monday RAMEN cure The pre configured combos are the way to go here you get 4 5 toppings appropriately styled for 5 and there are many vegetarian options The portions are great massive even and the staff is super friendly Recently they released bing su shaved ice desserts that are also super tasty and refreshing with fresh fruit and mochi red bean condensed milk etc if you are into it love love love 
0QHCY_55TFHHvyumEMpDew Urbana Good stuff Pricey by normal pizza standards 
0R0qfaNGEHYfki56mOsAjQ Urbana Ever since I visited a friend at U of I and we went here I can t stop raving about it I loved the variety of self served frozen yogurt huge machines lined against a wall From different cheesecake flavors to the simplest vanilla The amount of different toppings was also insane Everything tasted sooo good mmmmm The prices were also pretty good especially compared to other yogurt shops The atmosphere in the place is also great There is lounge type seating upstairs with tables and couches and egg shaped chairs Too bad I haven t been able to find such a good frozen yogurt place where I live 
0RNrLk6LtfqsOnI2LbgdSw Urbana People there are very friendly and helpful They teach me how to develop films and print them If you want to learn how to do black and white film photography talk to them 
0RQ-dmROUjQv_34ELskTNg Urbana The food was quickly served and service was nice but the food was a little eh Had Pad Thai eh and Pad Kee Mao spicy but lacked significant protein Easy spot close to campus but there are probably better Thai places around the area 
0S1sTYd4c16LHPfy3wgc5A Urbana I love Monicals and you can t beat the family deal Formidwextern pizza Monicals is hands down my favorite 
0sB7VB3IZpJiHTRpPRfMFg Urbana I went with a Chinese friend who ordered in Chinese When one of the dishes arrived and she didn t like the look of it she then shouted a lot at the waiter in Chinese After that the food was exceptional Easily the best Chinese food I ve had in Central Illinois I admit that s a low standard However I ve never been able to recreate this experience And how I ve tried I ended up asking my Chinese friend to write me a note in Chinese ordering these same dishes from the Chinese menu I show the crumpled and worn note to the waiter when I go by myself But the food is never as good I expect it was the shouting Now that my friend has moved away I expect it will never be that good again Without my friend to help us this is a mediocre place 
0SN9Lgp0q6i1vcGmK9A1Xg Urbana This library and the two Champaign Public libraries are awesome But whereas the main Champaign library is modern Urbana is in a historical building with lots of charm There is always plenty of staff to help The reference librarian is always helpful But by far this place has the best children s library I ve ever been too It is isolated from the rest of the library has lots of games puzzles and educational toys for kids and the staff for the children are very well selected for the department They put on so many great programs They also except donated books I find the quiet room on the main floor to be exactly that I have never gone there to study though so can t rate it on how it fairs for distractions in that realm Has a coffee shop Participates in e book lending 
0SnXNhHbogELJ8tPZyOjdg Urbana i don t know why but i wasn t expecting this place to be any good i guess maybe because i m a die hard bombay grill fan and didn t expect it to be up to that standard well i was 110 wrong i had a chicken tikka masala chana masala combo and it was absolutely delicious the staff was extremely helpful and polite and the outdoor seating was really nice on a sunny day this place deserves a big thumbs up yum 
0sR8OgwAiBzriRyM0W1sEQ Urbana Oh Firehaus I really wish you were better but with your normally absentminded waitresses and bartenders who on weekend nights are stuck up how can I really I think that you re tolerable on Mondays when I can kind of hear myself think the bartenders are the new ones and not completely jaded and I can drink cuervo silver margaritas for 3 But Firehaus my experience with you is generally bad The lines are ridiculous the music is overwhelmingly loud my friend s credit card got closed out to the wrong person and had someone else s drinks on it and his last name is not Smith or Jones or anything common What You did to get on my last nerve Once I was there and a seasoned bartender dipped a glass in the ice bin and it came up broken which means there was glass in the ice bin I pointed it out and so he got another glass and dipped it back in the same ice bin with glass in it Gross Their food is OK but overrated Bah Firehaus I will definitely not miss you when I move away 
0sSSTqlFyJWx2poxukHVNA Urbana Noodles and Company is an okay place for lunch and by okay I mean not that great It s located on campus which makes it an easy destination for lunch They serve Asian style noodles Italian pasta and American pasta think macaroni and cheese etc They also have soups and salads You get to pick your size regular or small and can add ingredients such as meat if you like I tried a couple of the Asian noodle dishes they were alright but really not too impressive I wouldn t mind so much if they were a dollar or two cheaper 
0svlJAQuN7UcbSf-c5kIfw Urbana Tried this place around 5 30 on a weeknight and it was not at all busy It did start getting busier towards the end of the meal but our service was good Luckily for me I had not been highly anticipating the opening of Destihl The beers were good enough There were about a dozen to choose from so if you drink beer at all you should be able to find one you like The night we went in we were given free 2oz samples of as many of the beers as we wanted to try I tried the Belgian Strawberry Blonde and Raspberry Wheat Champaign Blond and Frankengluten good flavors but none will be appearing on my all time favorites list The Frankengluten was interesting and worth a try if you are adventurous Our waiter was nice and attentive enough but could not properly give drink recommendations since he was not old enough to drink I thought this strange since clearly patrons are going to want to know about the beer The food I had the brie and portabello sandwich with chips The chips were average and the sandwich was bland That s honestly about the best I can say My dinner partner said his steak salad was excellent and it looked fresh and crisp but I can t vouch for the taste We split the beer battered asparagus and that was by far my favorite item I will probably go back at some point for another try The pizza and a desserts sounded like they may have potential Second visit 8 27 11 Finally tried the pizza pesto and goat cheese and still really no change in my review Nice wait staff but the food does not overly impress You do receive a large quantity of food for the price Although for me quantity does not trump quality 
0SzF2s9PDqpwHNiIxNJqFQ Urbana Thursday 2 any pint and they have two brothers and dead guy on tap Yesssss Also their fries are probably the best on Green St and their burgers ain t too shabby either The only thing I can t understand is the ridiculously long line to get in after 9pm especially after the second bar opened inside ohwell grad students go early 
0T4G8mjQNsJVXpVPBSWGCw Urbana Their cookies are ok for the only cookie delivery place in town But it should NOT take over an hour to get half a dozen cookies delivered to you Ever 
0T4zs45jK373Vha4TyYS7A Urbana Finally finally finally after years of trying mediocre fiestas toros haciendas and even chipoltes there is finally a place in Champaign Urbana to get delicious tacos Amazing corn tortillas made daily fresh ingredients chile de arbol and salsa de molcajete are more than enough reason to support this business In addition to the food I had the fish tacos a bargain at 2 75 and the most expensive taco on the menu the staff was super friendly and the 6 stool eatery made for an informal yet enjoyable dining experience Check it out you won t be disappointed 
0TdEosetwPrd4YPuujxUvg Urbana Looking for an omelet using my Yelp Mobile application I ended up at Radio Maria I was hoping Sam s Cafe was open with a more diverse breakfast menu but to no avail I would head to the trendy read odd Radio Maria Not Maria s Radio because who has a radio now a days I don t even have an Pod so I am one to talk about technological advances We were seated on a Saturday afternoon during the beginning of Restaurant Week in Champaign They were setting up all along the street for a big festival so I figured we should get somewhere quick before all the drunks show up haha There is a dining room which is where we were and a bar tapas area Seems really trendy hipster and urbanized You re definitely not in the suburbs of Chicago anymore I went with the Greek omelet that comes with house potatoes and beer bread to which I got fruit instead of the potatoes I also got a grilled plantain That s a banana almost different genus species for all you biology nerds out there Total for two people was under 20 Waitress was great refilling my water but she had too much lipstick on and didn t really seemed pleased to see me which was disappointing because most people love to see a short quirky medium skinned Yelp Elite member Not Ashley who was our server Oh well Will I go back Probably not but this makes the grade I used that pun because I am a teacher who teaches things to people hahaha TURN DOWN THE DAMN RADIO MARIA 
0tjtUCW5vJId1ok5jk1H5g Urbana There s something about this place that makes me like it more than I should Maybe because it s open until 3am most nights Or maybe because I simply have bad taste Either way you can t deny the thin crust pizza here It s cheap good and will fill you up which in the case of thin crust is a rarity I m giving this place four stars because every time I ve ever ordered from this place delivery or takeout the people working are usually slammed but still manage to be prompt and courteous 
0tWrL6If_OTRaEyUiRzAtw Urbana This place reminds me of this insane NYC spice store with every spice in the world It s overwhelming Aisle after aisle of spices All kinds of rices jams etc I bought some Greek mountain tea that I ve been wanting to try This store should be in Chicago or one like it If you are driving by Champaign this place is worth a pit stop It s always fun to just look at food crap 
0TxXfnVX8Wz_QBftgcOaNg Urbana Took my family to Kamakura to celebrate my wife s birthday Our food was very tasty our chef was very personable and entertaining We had a great meal and I m looking forward to going back Highly recommended 
0uFpIgQVx713eOQW22lJ4w Urbana My fiance and I never would have heard about Maize if it was not for an article about them written in the DI This very small hole in the wall restaurant is truly a hidden gem The tastefully decorated building is very small and has limited seating which honestly suits the quiet intimate atmosphere perfectly if parking or seating is a problem you may want to show up during off hours such as after 1pm or before noon perhaps We visited during break when campus was empty and had no issues The owner was very friendly chatting with customers and explaining the different items to us and offering his recommendations The portions are very inexpensive 2 4 on average and on the small size so that you may mix and match different items My fiance and I each ordered 2 chicken tacos and then shared 2 quesadillas one filled with pumpkin blossom and one with huitlacoche We had never had either filling and they were AMAZING The corn tortillas are all homemade a little thicker than usual and really good We were also offered free tortilla chips which were also thicker than normal perhaps made in house Very good with two delicious homemade salsas and lime A delicious and filling meal for two for just over 10 not bad at all In short this place offered some of the best Mexican food I ve ever tried It is extremely authentic and much lighter than the more stereotypical heavy refried beans sour cream cheddar cheese oil drenched Americanized Mexican fare We will be returning next week to bring a large order home to my fiance s family in town 
0UFsGBg30kqR9gI8xl9esA Urbana Love the atmosphere An awesome place for getting into a great conversation with someone The shake is very customizable u can mix different flavors you will find your favorite after some good digging and experimentation 
0UPxosi6pfg1128nKL49Aw Urbana Spoon House is a great place for lunch I love the Mex Asian fusion bugolgi burritos as well as the the traditional options on the menu The food isn t the best Korean food I ve eaten but it sure hits the spot when I m craving some bi bim bop If you have never tried Korean food Spoon House it s a great place to start The menu is full of popular Korean dishes and if you re not feeling adventurous the burritos and tacos are a great alternative 
0V3TTWedPdmuCqcOtRaolg Urbana Among all the Southern style BBQ places around campus Li l Porgy s is by far the most authentic and flavorful Frequent promotions made it hard not to go to Porgy s for at least some of our weekdays Their southern sweet tea is wonderful In comparison to the other Porgy s by the Original Pancake House I ve always thought this one to have a stronger smoky flavor 
0vdh9mnFmQEQ-bv1n38esg Urbana The food is alright but it s probably only worth the price if you get the discount with student id have a coupon for half off or have a coupon for a free stir fry Have been there a few times in the last few months because I had a coupon for a free stir fry and the service was terrible each time The waiter forgot to bring water drinks to the table several times after walking by and reassuring us that he ll be right back with water The waiter never came to check up on us throughout the meal to see if we needed anything and we needed more water at several points As for my food the last time it was not that great The sauce combo that i made was not good and i should have had one of the servers mix my sauces make your own sauces can really be hit or miss Finally when we asked for our check it took our waiter another 20 minutes to bring it then another 10 to bring a carry out box Overall the stir fry is decent but i would recommend having a server prepare your sauce mixture whenever I prepare it it never comes out quite right and prepare yourself for not so great service because the servers are mostly college students who are working for mediocre tips 
0VfioGn8htha1hPEawb2dQ Urbana Once upon a time this place was good but I can t say that s true any longer I believe that the tapas area is a good bar but not so much a good restaurant Go to Cafe Luna for better and cheaper food I used to enjoy the other restaurant They still have good free chips and salsa that you eat while you wait for your food The actual stuff on the menu is not so good Also they haven t changed the menu in the last half year Everything on it right now seems Spanish inspired and some of the things aren t so inspiring to eat UPDATE I went here for drinks the other night I am not a big fan of their table set up even though the bar was pretty cool I think they must not have very good bartender s working here on the weekend It took like five minutes for them to figure out how to make a rum and diet Coke And it didn t even taste right It was like vanilla rum or vanilla Coke But to their credit I heard they have good mojitos 
0VhavmG379gBYVE5-2Cenw Urbana I love Lil Porgy s sauce I don t like spicy foods but their mix sauce is just right I almost always get their chicken sandwich with mild sauce and a cup of the mix sauce Their sandwiches come with an order of fries They also offer potato salad pickle spears and a few other sides I can t remember right now Definately worth a try if you like barbeque 
0vm21DGu4FbW8sZv4l3m9w Urbana There are several restaurants here in Chambana that want to be like the Big Grove but this place is the real deal So happy to see it open We tried a little bit of everything last night and it was all very good as described midwestern classics nicely prepared with a twist or two We started with cocktails and bar bites split a salad main courses and dessert Our favorites were the cucumber y patio pounder cocktail tater tots and amazing sweet potato waffles Overall too I was most impressed with all of the vegetables which when they were cooked were cooked to crunchy perfection and beautifully balanced with spices and sauces It s ironic then that the one weak spot on the menu is veggies I m a mostly veggie eater and it s always a bit depressing to see only one vegetarian main dish the complex and creamy macaroni and cheese which can be made without bacon I m confident that vegetarians could put together a good meal from sides and salads and the lovely whitefish works for pescetarians like me But the chef is clearly talented and so I d love to see the menu rounded out with a few interesting pure veggie options Either way I know that we ll be back to explore further Next time we ll have to be early enough for my husband to try the burger 
0vpCPVMFLtM-idLGZUwlkA Urbana Cakes on Walnut is a interesting place fun to grab a snack in the afternoon with friends as well as a great date nite stop The decor is really visually interesting with high ceilings spacious seating and cupcake bar seating as well but plenty of room to move around What is brilliant about this little place is the gimmick great cupcakes and alcohol They have a different assortment of cupcakes everyday and I have yet to try anything I didn t love but also did not surprise me The Red Velvets are one of their classics but the Coconut and Pistachio are spontaneous and amazing Ideally you should always try anything seasonally related A great perk to the cupcakes is the serving sizes they have a regular and a petite size of each flavor This allows you to either try multiple flavors if you cannot decide but have a threshold for sugar as well adjust according to your appetite They have a wide selection of wines red and white bottled beer and coffee type drinks to go with the cupcakes depending on what kind of evening you are having Located on a street filled with nice restaurants and bars this is a great place to go at nights end or if you just need an afternoon pick me up I highly recommend Cakes on Walnut NOTE Every year this bakery releases a fund raising calendar in collaboration with other local merchants for a few dollars The girls who work there pose with the baked goods and are dressed by local retailers Also like many of the cafes in the area they sponsor local artists by hanging art on their walls for sale Both are really good ways to support the local professional arts community in Champaign 
0vQnAwe9p1kDzr16jHoDMg Urbana I have eaten here a few times and never been overly impressed with this place Last night I ate here and ordered the Tomato and Pesto grilled cheese Huge mistake My grilled cheese came out with one slice of hard dried to the bread cheese on two huge pieces of Texas toast It was so dry I had to ask for marinara sauce to dip it in just to choke it down So not worth it flavorless and disgusting Kinda like how I feel about everything else I have ordered there OK for drinks but avoid the food Oh and don t bother complaining to the GM Andy He could care less Way to keep customers 
0wolXt7OH2gCJtc536T9aA Urbana You ve got to be kidding me As I write this every single review is five stars Let s get a grip here Early in the season this market is a small gathering of people selling root vegetables in an empty lot Plenty of parking Bailey B writes That s one way to put it It s fine if you need beets The produce is often better and always cheaper at Meijer but it isn t local The produce is sometimes better at the Food Co Op but more expensive 
0Wyb1Ko341-mHn_Wn2v9GQ Urbana Overall Mike and Molly s is a great place to go have a beer and not get hassled Prices are good and there s an excellent scotch whisky selection as well It does in fact have the best beer garden by a long shot in C U The problem is many nights there s some horrible local music show blasting in that self same beer garden that you have to pay cover for when it s empty it s a great place to sit and talk and unwind Your mileage may vary depending on how much you like local music People label this place a dive bar and it is but on the other hand it s very clean the bathrooms are actually usable unlike the Pig and the crowd is not going to disgustingly hit on your significant other and will leave you alone to relax if you want That said this bar does have a weakness if you spend an entire evening settled in at the bar it s the last gasp stop for local hipsters to hook up It s can be quiet all night but around 12 o clock the hipsters start pouring in looking for hookups It s strange and offputting and also makes the place reek of desperation Oh well that s not M M s fault and I can forgive it for that 
0xoBmGQ2bmXBhYpy7hCByw Urbana Lunch Buffet Awesome Much better deal than 1 sushi They had korean glass noodles red curry egg rolls tempuras some kind of soup and 3 sushi rolls and probably more stuff that I left out The food was all good 
0xOH5Belmro0J8rxJ_pR0Q Urbana This is a true neighborhood bar Quaint divey but great atmosphere Friendly staff cheap beer with some decent varieties on tap Since it s relatively small it s nice that it s an over 21 crowd Great location a campus town secret 
0xruzaILlZ3npueBEWQyjA Urbana This place has the best cookies and customer service Their staff is so nice and accommodating Their cookies all varieties are absolutely amazing I live in Chicago and have been to many bakeries and nothing compares to the Cookie Jar in Champaign My favorite is the sugar cookie with icing If you like any type of cookies desserts you NEED to check out the Cookie Jar 
0XT4_MyGISNRhcVfbnbldw Urbana I really liked this place It was recommended to me by some friends and when I walked up at 6 30pm on a Monday night by the number of people sitting outside I thought no way would I get a seat to study Low and behold as I open the door great music floods my ears fabulous decorations and air conditioning And open tables I order a house coffee to start off with and after I taste it I am horrified at what I ve been drinking out of my Mr Coffee in the mornings I grab a table next to a wall and next to the place where the cook the food And right over the air conditioning vent I really don t study well when I m hot so the air conditioning was a huge plus The food smelled great the lighting was perfect it wasn t too loud with people talking but the soft background noise helped me to focus and study I tried the pesto turkey panini which was fabulous And they wear gloves when they make your sandwhiches And cute garnishes And the coffee was reasonably price I always think paying over 5 for a sandwhich is a little too much but you re paying for wifi and atmosphere as well and supporting a local busines so I suppose it s worth it Overall I plan to spend many a weeknight there studying and drinking coffee although I may have to switch to decaf because I was up way too late after that Okay not all tables and chairs are created equal I ended up sitting at a very uncomfortable table Now if I was just there hanging out with friends and playing a game or something I probably wouldn t have cared But I was trying to read and study and sometimes I fidget or sit cross legged on the chair but the table had these panels on it that made it too short to do either And the tables that look out the glass front window are great to people watch but once it gets dark the lighting is pretty low To visit and chat no problem But studying towards the back would be better Luckily someone left and I grabbed a different table But still great coffee music and good place to go I still definitely recommend I was here the other night and maybe it was a fluke last time but there was plenty of lighting by the tables in the front by the windows Just FYI And I still love their turkey panini I prefer their house coffee to their Coffee of the Day I still haven t found a Coffee of the Day that I prefer to their house coffee 
0XXWMIsjs7q9ARt8Gwutng Urbana Fair is stretching it The ribeye was a low grade supermarket cut Not on my list to revisit in the future 
0yeeY75fpWHDN4ipaCULHg Urbana I have to agree with what previous reviewers have written the food is sub par especially considering the price I have yet to try the sushi there but I have had the cali rolls which came with the box they were precisely what I had expected This place is alright when you need a large pile of food and you re at everitt and you also need to run through the rain and you d like to limit your distance to about one street crossing sarku is right up your alley 
0yfhjNhTBWXUcTZHiASWyw Urbana Great one of a kind furniture and accessories The owners are friendly and helpful and have a good eye for interesting items I m not sure what to call the store vitage y mostly mid century 50s 70s pieces We ve scored some outstanding pieces at really good prices Even if you don t need anything this is a fun store to browse and you always feel welcome 
0YmeVm3y5HnT8oj1hoX5Iw Urbana Update time So if you look at the sign outside you ll notice that the name is split up so it has FU above the word BAR Yes This bar gives a big ol FU to its patrons Came here Friday night for a weekend of visiting my old haunts and catching up with some friends The night started off well enough the front bar was closed but we were all chilling and having some good convos and such in the back Then a bunch of other people rolled in filling up the half of the bar we weren t using That s cool Not cool When the bartender is obviously friends with that half I mean sure serve your friends But how do you not even TURN AROUND I m feeling like an idiot waving my money when you can t even do something as simple as scanning the bar I d never experienced anything like it I ve waited a long time for a drink but when you don t even TURN AROUND how will I ever get served You deserve the angry as hell note I wrote on my receipt as I closed my tab and Fubar deserves less than the one star I m giving it 
0z2ZFYfhxRDyMkqms3RtMQ Urbana I went here to get a nice piece of costume jewelry for my mother for her birthday They had a bunch of fairly classy stuff and the helpful clerk that assisted me was trained to ask the right questions to narrow down my search I went here first then ventured to other DT Champaign stores to examine the alternative possibilities They were all closed This is the only jewelry store in DT Champaign open past 5 00pm although Spritz s say they re open till 5 15 they closed and locked the door early that day So I went with the nice piece from Christopher s which they wrapped up nice with a bow and a biz card from the artist and my mom loved it 
0zcZmN0END6mS6ZsOJ3IZQ Urbana I just had my first visit to Spoon House and I really enjoyed my experience The owner came out from behind the counter and explained everything very well I asked for his recommendation on what to order as it was my first time I had the Beef Bulgogi quesadilla and I thought it was very tasty I mentioned to the owner that I like spicy food and he brought me out a piece of the spicy pork quesadilla on the house which was also very tasty One reviewer mentioned they didn t have Kimchi but when I was there they had little styrofoam containers with Kimchi sitting to the right on the counter for free I had some and also thought this was tasty as well It s super clean and very nice on the inside I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu and will recommend it to other people 
0zyzANFZzBjpQpxakiyOUQ Urbana This is the best way to get to and from Chicago from Champaign If you book long enough ahead of time you can ride for 13 each way If you wait until the last minute you are going to pay 36 which is still less than the private busses If you are going to Chicago the Amtrak drops you at Union Station which is really convenient to take the Metra out to the burbs Blue Line to O Hare Orange to Midway el to wherever 3 block walk or busses and trolley a free bus to wherever else It is true that the train can run late just like the private busses but it is extremely rare for this to occur on the early morning trains I actually prefer it to driving as I can do work on the train read a book or sleep Trains are much more spacious than buses or planes and have plugs for laptops etc no WiFi yet You can even walk around and use a human sized bathroom In the car all that I can do is sit eat and get older You can also drink on the train cafe car has beer but you can also BYOB Just sayin Also if you are feeling awesome check out the Rockstar Ride departs Friday Saturday nights from Champaign at 7 59pm arriving downtown Chicago at 10 45pm Departs from Chicago on Saturday Sunday morning at 8 15am A night to never remember 
1-hvYmaH1fiU-VX9pGLQNA Urbana I absolultely LOVE gyros so this is a no brainer for me I feel like this place is a staple of quick delicious campus food It s pretty much a total hole in the wall but it s totally Illini everything about the decor just screams it Not to mention the gyros are bomb Go if you haven t already 
109hZIMcRM23pe99hA9OxA Urbana I really really wanted to have a good experience at McKinley However since I ve been on campus since Fall 2008 I ve only ventured to McKinley about five times Of those five times I ve only left there feeling better on ONE occasion and even that had its major downfalls I came in right at 8 AM one morning this past September with a piercing persistent migraine in which I was seen promptly by a doctor I was then injected with two different medications in both of my hips and I was not told what the medications were even after asking to have copies of the information so I could forward it to my doctor at home A nurse told me we do not disclose that information to our patients Excuse me but if I was just treated with heavy medication I believe I have the right to know what it was called especially if I could have a negative reaction to it later on I also went into McKinley TWICE this past February for a severe hacking dry cough and was only given the run of the mill cough syrup which didn t do me any good The doctors told me I simply had a cold but after about a month and a half of coughing my lungs out I went to a real doctor at home and was told I had bronchitis and was given antibiotics and REAL cough syrup that worked McKinley HATES giving out antibiotics for some reason since every ailment you have must be a cold or just a cough My advice avoid this place and go home for the weekend to be treated by real doctors who actually want you to get better 
10g1MapRrho0mnE0eaw0HA Urbana I ve just got into the whole tapas craze and figured if my friends enjoy V Picasso I bet I will too Clearly I was delusional V Picasso formerly the office bar in Urbana is a wannabe tapas bar The only thing I enjoyed out of my meal was the complimentary olives the waitress brought us Everything on the menu that my bf and I ordered was unappetizing and the majority of their menu doesn t have any creative vegetarian options I ve been told that their sangria is great but to go just for the sangria would make no sense not to mention everything is overly priced Also let me add by saying around 8 oclock they ran out of the chocolate cake that I had been eying so much on the menu Well if our waitress hadn t forgotten part of our tapas maybe we would have ordered the chocolate cake in time for them not to run out Sorry but they were not attentive at all and took their sweet time bringing out our food I do understand it is tapas and therefore should take longer but seriously Overall I left the restaurant still hungry after ordering plenty of tapas and my bf left just as hungry with a lighter wallet I am considering going one more time just to make sure this wasn t a one time accident they had but for the price tag I think I ll be headed over to Luna for my tapas fix these days 
10qXGAozKr0pZb3AnbkHLA Urbana It s good But there s so much hype about it that I expected more Indoor seating would be nice on a hot summer day The whole establishment screams of Midwest country homemade ice cream custard whatever 
10yHjsF1BEhGcxbrAVJjvw Urbana McDonalds is generally McDonalds The food here is fine but service atmosphere is lacking They seem to have some sketchy clientele almost saw a fight break out here once Also they have very strict BBQ sauce quotas Unless you buy mcnuggets or chicken selects they make you pay for any bbq sauce you want 0 25 pack I think it s sort of ridiculous that you can t get free bbq sauce with your chicken sandwich 
11zaCMoN7s8qGo1Qp591IQ Urbana Think relaxing comfortable and pleasant you have come to the right place I have been to Emerald City numerous times and always have a great time A relaxing upscale lounge that is a welcome addition to Champaign The owners and staff are extremely attentive and accommodating As hard as they DO try and would love to have the time for a conversation with each and every person who walks through their door they DO have a business to run too If they don t come talk to you then go talk to them Wonderful martinis beer selection and excellent light food menu is fab I recommend the Fontina Great live entertainment most nights we enjoyed Candy Foster last night and it was one of the best crowds ever It was like being in a beautiful upscale comfy living room i e a lounge and having a great band play just for you The patio area is a huge plus and perfect this fall with the addition of the stone Firebowls Come to ECL you will not be disappointed 
12CJYDSsuinH9h8F-hAD4g Urbana Yeah This place is yummy In every way The burger was excellent made us want another one Fries were great My chicken liver P t was soooooo good with jelly and the bread was divine My Mac n cheese was good and smoky a little dry but could tell it was individually made and good Bartender Lisa was enthusiastic and attentive Can t wait to come back and eat Might have to get back in here tomorrow Lol 
13BnVwzhlhekMZEukeFe4Q Urbana I can see this would be a good group experience the setting of the tables lined walls with cozy booths and private areas for larger groups seemed appealing The food however was underwhelming What was ordered Bento lunch box teryaki chicken and sushi Spicy tuna was TERRIBLE Yes I like the American version with the spicy mayo but this was far from and there was some sort of spicy pepper mixture on top of the tiniest rolls i ve ever seen The taste was lacking and the rice seemed a bit stale The guest I was with had a beef veggie bowl and it was bland served in nothing more then a standard brown gravy with little taste Best item on the menu iced tea Don t waste your time The price may be decent but the food lacks the same feeling 
14-ouiQAL1U1sRvCchyPpw Urbana Sure Sherman has it s issues The rooms are no bigger than prison cells and the design of the bathroom doors allows your roommate to walk into your room at any time I really love the location and after living here for two years realized that I don t need that much space The staff are incredibly friendly and are good people This includes the RD RAs housing staff maintenance staff and building service workers I wish there was a dining hall because eating at IT sucks 
14TBnOWDTuZ6HxPcxeoY0Q Urbana Never again This is a terrible place for anybody looking to enjoy themselves If having fun is not your thing check out Fat City My second time here confirmed in spades the general feeling of badness I got the first visit The first time a year ago was a weekend night and they had a lot of people All the garbage that comes with a large half and half campusy crowd was there that time They had keg service outside in a busted little shed plastic cups long lines beer foam splashing all over and a full compliment of asshats Inside the place doesn t look that bad They have dark wood accents a selection of booths tables and a long bar They have 2 nice pool tables a shuffle puck table you dont have to pay for the machine to keep score there s an app for that now a new golden tee and a couple of other games that looked playable The second time I went was a Tuesday night I realize Tuesday is a polarizing night for bars but I am solidly in the camp of lovers of bars on the empty side A group of grad students I run with had called ahead letting the place know we would be coming en masse Many of this crew refused to come I surmise based upon how terrible this bar is So we had about 80 less people there than we warned them about ahead of time So the service was great right Nope The worst I ve experienced in Champaign Urbana Drinks took literally 20 minutes One bartender with ADHD had a system for remembering what everybody had was running around like a chicken with his head cut off The guy was really trying but he did not do his job efficiently at all he would ask you what you wanted listen to the very first thing you said then turn away and get right on it before you were done talking He would then stop preparing your drink order mid way to take care of somebody else and their extended family He would then serve up your drink and act like you were the jerk because you wanted two additional drinks Those three drinks will cost you 9 plus 20 35 minutes of your life This system led to a half dozen or more people at any given time stuck in the purgatory between ordering a drink s receiving said drink s and paying for same The music system sucks A really muddy sound that makes old standards hardly understandishable and the bar artificially loud In the nearly empty bar described above it was hard to hear even those near to you and doubly hard to communicate with the bartender It was easier to hear elsewhere but they must put the speakers over the bar so the bartender can t hear complaints The food sucks Terrible selection of boring pub grub standards of BBQ d meat fried meat crappy frozen crinkle cut fries On Tuesday they have 2 00 margaritas that are TERRIBLE Bottom shelf tequila plus too much bottom shelf margarita mix over ice no blend option Oh yeah there is an old guy sitting at the end of the bar talking loudly to himself The aforementioned sound quality makes this even creepier as only occasional strains of his soliloquy find their way through the muddy garbage music they play here Classic Rawk 2 steps below NOW I really thought about giving this place 2 stars for the following reasons 4 bottles of good beers like Rogue Dead Guy and Bell s Oberon and a shuffle puck table new Golden Tee Pre Yelping the place in my head I was resigned to give them 2 stars as a recognition of such efforts even if they were not reflected in positive results Then my buddy got his Blue Moon draft in a plastic cup 
16utaPhG3y8VFfZF-Kp2BQ Urbana One of the most magical places on earth and certainly my favorite place in Champaign Urbana If you re into crafting DIYing or just tend to MacGyver your way through life this is definitely the place for you There is always something new and awesome to discover here whether you re looking for a specific item or tool to complete a project or are open to being inspired by whatever they happen to have in stock that day you surely won t be disappointed I can also strongly recommend volunteering here if you have a bit of free time to spare It is so satisfying to help sort through organize their donations and a lot of fun to see all the cool stuff that comes in everyday 
16V1wIyra8dBoawxuezd2w Urbana Moving here from California I was expecting there to be nothing asian in Illinois This small market was a huge surprise to me As soon as I walked in it reminded me of the asian markets in San Jose California The only thing that I can think of that this place does not have is fresh sea food However it wouldn t be fair for me to deduct a star entirely because of this I deduct a star because of the lack of anything fresh Fresh vegetable section is very limited Fresh anything is very limited If you need anything in a can bottle or rice sack this place has 
16x8SW5KTDRjyasR2Q16ag Urbana Been here so many times It became one of my to go joint every time I go home from my clinicals Love their Pad thai and Pho The Pho is a little different in this place its has more flavor in it than any other pho I ve tasted probably because of the celery Yes celery Best thai ice tea in town hands down I enjoy their Mongolian beef and Tom Yum soup as well I love the service they serve their food pretty quick The only thing I m concern about is the tray area is a tad filthy and they could ve clean the area more often than leave plates their for some time But who gives a damn they got the best food ever 
17NtaSBMfUsKGYyy63Wpdg Urbana This isn t the world s greatest pizza but it s what Pizza Hut s pizza used to taste like back in the 80s before they started being bad It s greasy buttery crunchy and tasty I know that doesn t say much for those who never knew what good Pizza Hut used to taste like but it was very nostalgic to me Theyhave hand tossed sicilian pan this is what i had and deep They have a lunch special of two slices and a drink for 5 They have either pepperoni sausageor cheese and unfortunately they won t add any extra toppings to it grrr There s only one bench in there so there s no dining in Another grrr It wouldn t be my first choice for lunch in that area but s a decent alternative if you re craving for a quick greasy lunch 
183DscUUgfOrgIvDIYyHKQ Urbana You know what there s not to like about Bentley s NOTHING It s a neighborhood bar if there ever was one And while it s right on the edge of downtown it s still in my neighborhood I got a 20 oz pint of Dark Horse Scotty Karate Scotch Ale incredible by the way for 4 75 It was only mildly crowded for 10pm on a Saturday night and there was pretty good free music playing It s not even a dive bar It s actually kind of pretty I can t wait to come here all the time and do a two block drunken stumble back home after having spent 15 or less 
18yb800gfKQkqNWlf46_Vw Urbana MAKE CUPCAKES NOT WAR That s what the employee s shirt said I wanted it Cakes is open at 7 am every morning The interior has trendy hardwood floors and white tables and chairs Note you can also get Capogiro gelato and cocktails here The Aztec chocolate cupcake had decent choc cake and some red hot cinnamon chili taste to the frosting which was marshmallow fluff like in texture The cake in the cinnamon blood orange cinnamon flavored and margarita lime flavored cupcakes was okay but the frosting on both had a waxy almost foamy texture Not my cup of tea or cup of cake I didn t finish the frosting and I NEVER never finish the frosting 
19PjtTdRpoz-VyyRPGOyvw Urbana This is by far the best Mexican in town And that said it is also one of the cheapest places to eat I know it is near campus but it is sooooooo good and I recommend it to all I eat there at least once a week and I have yet to be anything but happy 
1aabcMlwVBmkOgZwo-2jdA Urbana I ve eaten at a lot of great places in my absence so prepare for a string of gushing reviews Despite being extremely busy on a home game day our group of 4 was able to score outdoor seating pretty much right away Our waitress was nice and as attentive as she could be for having to wait on 10 tables at once You could tell the cafe was going for more of an old school thing with it s antique register wooden everything menu items etc For brunch on such a gorgeous late summer day my friends and I knew we HAD to sit outside I can definitely see myself coming back to relax with a newspaper book and a sandwich Plus I hear their milkshakes are pretty good so I guess I ll have to try that out as well Did I mention their portions here are pretty much huge My friend and I split their Dagwood and Desert Dippers healthy right and were STUFFED afterwords The quality of the food itself wasn t anything special but it still hits the spot when you haven t had anything to eat all day like us I ll be back here for sure 
1abeApkseFIPYRLonCPh2A Urbana This is one of those restaurants that makes me wish I lived in Champaign Urbana again Even though it s been open for years I didn t go until recently We went for a brunch and the food was amazing My wife had the french toast and something eggy Probably an omelet The french toast was fabulous I don t know what kind of bread they use but it s perfect She was able to taste some of the egg used but I just tasted lovely golden syrup and cinnamon The cuban was served on a fresh baguette The meat was terrific and so was the bread The american fries I think that we each got with the meal were perfectly cooked and seasoned The decor is very cool nice artwork hangs on the walls and because it s downtown it s close to Cowboy Monkey The Art Theatre and The Virginia theatre VERY highly recommended 
1AOHwZUIRWCnFhCLV-fKrw Urbana They serve excellent Tong Yum noodle soup 
1B-J5wByoL6QC927GTjeFg Urbana First of all I really miss Gillian s That place was awesome Aside from that I ate here once with my boyfriend Initially I really liked the interior and we were greeted immediately However we did make the mistake of coming here during Graduation weekend so it was packed and the menu was limited We didn t wait that long surprisingly and the food was pretty good but I really want to come back when it s not packed full of students and their families so I can try the rest of the menu and hopefully give this place another star or two 
1bKNP-JfZX2cDqxcxaa-Hg Urbana I think it goes without saying that this is my opinion but a burger from Farren s is the best burger available in CU no contest Fries are nothing special but if yr looking for tasty fries you prolly know where to go Courier Esquire Wonderdogs I stick with the chips that come with the burger Friendly staff sorry to hear the other young lady found it to be too friendly but I would suggest it s better than the alternative I guarantee that it s meant to make sure you are happy with your meal more like when yr here yr family than olive garden could ever be The best burger around period Nice selection of good salads too 
1BRgh6Wgh0v_vNveaJShBA Urbana The Bread Company is one of the best restaurants in C U If you think that the reason why they are selling out of different entrees at dinner is because of poor planning it is obvious that you have never worked in the restaurant industry Dishes sell out at the Bread Company because they are popular duh There is no way to predict what will sell what night and if you are upset that dishes are out of stock you should be showing up earlier to insure that they still have their full night s supply As for the service being poor it s true the servers are mostly college kids that could give two shakes about their job but the food is so incredible it just doesn t matter to me The head chef Daniel is honest to God a pure genius when it comes to creating new dishes and I never order off of anything but the specials menu Trust me when I say trust Dan with your dinner If he has a hand in creating it it s bound to be amazing 
1BW--n7SRAtRqKE8rHMl7w Urbana Great salad bar and service but everything else is terrible Do not waste your money 
1CLE0burI_36WAC17NmpCg Urbana Wow I used to think that the Burger here was one of the best ever not anymore I was in Champaign last week on a Wednesday evening Murphy s was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm I ordered a Mega Bacon Cheeseburger and fries Sat at the bar and had to ask the bartender if he could please wipe off the bar in front of me because it was all messy you would have thought I called him mother a dirty name Service here was terrible The burger Much smaller than I remember The fries barely edible they were like eating balsa wood that had been deep fried All in all a terrible meal I won t be returning not with all the other places in town now where you can get some good eats 
1cVSDvzumyyxDoWKf-LXxA Urbana This place is really cool but it s also really overwhelming I give it five stars for the awesome stuff they have in there It was kind of like walking through a museum I give it one star for the organization quality of some of the things they were selling At some point my friend and I observed an old nail kit that was obviously well used and pretty gross Things like that should just be thrown away That comes out to about three stars right So if you like looking at buying old interesting possessions this is a place for you unless you get overwhelmed by small spaces and clutter easily If that is the case stay away from here 
1DCPH7cgmKtQi5QFuAW1-g Urbana Visited the first time a few weeks ago I got the Bento Box chicken teriyaki for dinner It was a LOT of food I don t for CA rolls so I passed that to my bf Everything else was great though The BF got their chirashi and he thought it was great He has been back and said it was good on his second visit 
1ddGgTuA0FjA-u19f7N1lA Urbana Have eaten here MANY times over the years from when it was just a panini joint to just the other day I think this place s most inventive time was its best time about 3 years ago maybe a little more Food items are less adventurous and price point has increased with time That said the desserts under their pastry chef of the last year or two have been TOPS Service I have always found to be very good and knowledgeable esp about wine I am curious to see how the metamorphosis of the former Persimmon Grocery into a mozzarella bar is CU ready wine lounge private dining salon will go 
1dj0fMMeUs-WE1Q-8xpGAw Urbana This is likely the best Mexican restaurant in town I ate once at one of Rick Bayless restaurants I was sitting in one and ordered off the menu of the other Yes weird He s the go to guy on Mexican cuisine in the US competed on Iron Chef etc I enjoyed my meal at Mas Amigos more My wife ordered the Steak with poblanos It was perfectly cooked tender and flavorful The poblano chilis were beautiful I ordered the Chicken enchiladas with mol sauce I am a big sucker for a good mol and this was a great mol The chef makes the sauce on the premises with dozens of ingredients It is complex and flavorful Mmm Just thinking about it I almost forgot that the sauce was served with some fabulous chicken enchiladas tender tortillas wrapped around moist and tender shredded chicken These are the enchiladas and sauce that the others in town should aspire to be one day The chips are also made on the premises They aren t exactly low fat but they knock Chevy s chips to a far distant second Likewise the salsas In addition to the dish of fresh salsa we were served two made here bottled plastic squeeze bottles salsas a red smoky and firey and a green that reminded me of summertime I used to think that the beans and rice at a Mexican restaurant were a very optional part of the meal Not here Both are surprisingly tasty and of very good texture Although pretty full by the end of the main course we are suckers for a good Flan We were not disappointed Texture and flavor were spot on The service was friendly and attentive This place is doing so much right they really deserve to succeed We will definitely be returning here often 
1dMAY4jp5URVM-fmejt2aQ Urbana This place USED to be fantastic and the only reason I m giving it two stars instead of one is out of reverence for the memory of what it used to be When The Great Impasta was in downtown Champaign a few years ago it was always top notch and I never had any complaints But since they ve moved to Lincoln Square Mall in Urbana It s been consistently bad I went there a year ago and swore I d never go back But I caved a while back and returned Again it was awful The pasta was overcooked and the alfredo sauce tasted like it came out of a can At least when I went a year ago even though the food sucked the service was very good But last time both the food AND service sucked And the price For me and my wife two entrees and a bottle of wine over 70 freaking dollars Seriously I should have stayed home and had Chef Boyardee Talk about flushing your money down the toilet And I m not sure what they were doing with their decor but they had pictures that looked like they had been printed out on an ink jet printer taped with scotch tape to the wall in every booth WTF This time I really am never going back I m afraid Urbana is where restaurants go to die 
1EarGnDwEvfn8WET2EnYVA Urbana I find myself in Champaign for a quick 3 hour meeting and I remember a coworker is an U of I grad He must know where I should go eat and he texts me back saying Zas Papa Dells and Geovantis He wasn t sure if Zas was still around and I wasn t in a deep dish mood One look at Yelp mobile and all I see are written down are Chicken Fingers Chicken fingers and chicken fingers So I come word to wise if you think you are hungry for 12 fast food size Chicken strips order 5 here They re that big If they had better beer on tap and buffalo sauce this would be 5 stars You re almost there Geos I wonder how many people come in late night stoned with the munchies 
1ECHenFxMWE_5RznAjeTdg Urbana I have been using the Illini Tech Center since they opened Their service is quick and the techs really know their stuff My son went to college in Missouri where they supposedly have the best campus Apple center in the country When his hard drive failed it took them over a week to swap it out for a new one It was very impersonal In contrast I have had many hard drive failures over the past few years on my various computers and the Illini Tech Center usually fixes the problem within a day or two if the part is in stock The online tech appointment tool is useful and I have never had to wait for service nor to get my questions answered I recommend this place most highly The only negative would be that parking is expensive and difficult to find 
1epIOppWv-Ig5JUfsCAJyQ Urbana Two friends and I lunch occasionally and are always faced with big crowds here on campus One suggested Clybourne No big lunch crowd made me wonder about the food and service Well both were great Lots to choose from on the menu and the service is quick and friendly Have been back several times and tried different menu items and always enjoyed Try the Irish Nachos Quite good I remember when Coslow s was around and they had them Clybourne s are excellent 
1ESY4mybk3H9-Zayg8hF9g Urbana The chic decor dim lights and cozy booths set the intimate mood at Boltini Lounge There are also additional seating areas in the back to accommodate larger groups but especially during busier hours I think that smaller groups work best I love the menu s variety of selection to choose from My personal favorites include the crab cakes liar s club the sriracha sauce is absolutely delish meat a balls and grilled cheese that you can dip into shots of the yummiest tomato vodka soup The drinks are a little pricey but are always really good and stiff you ll get your money s worth The male servers during my first two visits to Boltini were exceptional They were knowledgeable hospitable and professional During my last visit however we had a female server and although she was polite she was very curt and seemed impatient for us to quickly order eat and pay as if it were a full house in reality we were one of only two tables during that early dinner hour Overall I would recommend Boltini The prices are reasonable and the food is pretty great If the good service was more consistent across the staff I would be more keen to give Boltini a straight 5 stars 
1f53tLGxPt30FTnvq842cg Urbana This place was poppin We had to park in the Dallas and Co Parking lot cause the Parking Lot was full The entire structure is pretty cool they ve been pretty successful with an attempt to Go Adobe Overall the food though wasn t that great I guess I might just have really high expectations for mexican food because I love it I ordered their Mexican Combo Dinner and got a beef tamale chile con queso chorizo enchilada and the enchilada was my fave 
1F5L5Tr9rlwawfTvyg8qRQ Urbana Another establishment I frequented quite a bit while the U of I I loved creating my own pasta dish with fresh veggies and delicious sauces fresh parmesan and a HUGE piece of garlic bread It was very reasonably priced and the upstairs dining area is very nice I took my parents here many times during moms and dads weekends and they also fell in love with Za s you cannot go wrong It does get SUPER crowded during lunchtime so go at an off time if you want to just waltz right in I need to go back and visit just to get me some Za s 
1fD3BSKaFen3Zj-SuXwn2A Urbana I am a student at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science and I went here with a friend of mine who grew up in Champaign He couldn t believe the changes It s a beautiful building with plenty of space and friendly staff We were able to easily reserve a room so that we could do his fantasy football draft All of the natural light and comfortable chairs really create a space that is extremely inviting I m required to volunteer somewhere for a class of mine and I chose this library if only to spend more time here Now if only I could get a library card I just have to prove I live here hm 
1fEAUbsDd8x3uV6IDsYGKQ Urbana With a very reasonable price list and a very varied menu it really is hard to get tired of this place Whenever lunch brings me to campus town I usually eat here There are discounts available for students that bring it down to the poor grad student budgetary range and the option to take home a bowl makes it an even better deal If you re new to this restaurant though be sure to either go with an experienced friend or tell the wait staff you re new there are a few insider tricks in preparing your food that you won t learn other wise One of the best is to always ALWAYS put the blue stick for bread in with your stir fry 
1FyNHVxez6IQBBn-2ZZjgA Urbana Ok I am a food snob from Los Angeles Just moved here and to be totally honest I think the food here is so plain Yes you have a lot of great steak places and American food but things such as Sushi there is NO good places I have tried each and every one and Indian are hard to come by We first went to Basmati and honestly I thought we were doomed There was no flavor and most dishes seemed to be watered down NOW we were driving near campus and we drove by Bombay and I am more then happy we stopped As for the other poster whos friends said its over spiced have you tried real Indian food This is tame in comparison The food is just right and always served fresh and hot The semosas are great and served with the best sauces We love the Gobi Aloo and chicken masala we will be back to try other dishes Bottom line other then the lackluster decor and sometimes dirty looking floors this place was a sweet treat for those of us who are used to some variety 
1GDpAdGg1DDOkigYFeRy_g Urbana I love KCPA The venue is awesome for just about everything I attend the symphony series the chamber music series and the ballet I ve enjoyed some of the greats in music and dance there The staff and volunteers are cordial and efficient I also attend the Salon series that showcases rising young talent who have earned prestigious awards This is a fun series The seating is limited and on the stage up close and personal with the artist Prior to the performance champagne and finger foods are served The food is exquisite After the performance coffee and truffles or petit fours are served It s a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon The Promenade shop offers an array of esoteric items ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime Intermezzo offers some tasty sweets and savories and a yummy Jamaican coffee blend Only complaint here is that they only have one cashier which slows things down especially during intermissions I do remember fondly the old Intermezzo that had an even wider array of decadent sweets to delight the palate and destroy the waistline And then there is the Stage 5 Bar I have sampled several of their wine offerings and can only say that I have never been able to go beyond one sip I have abandoned further attempts with the wine and moved on to my old standby cocktail the Black Russian There is a young lady who frequently tends bar there who makes the best Black Russian I ve yet to try the food platters at Stage 5 although I have seen them Meager portions It seems however that they are always out of the one s I want I am a contributor to KCPA and urge others to do likewise This great venue brings in a wealth of fine entertainment one would only expect to find in big cities For a fancy night out a romantic evening a family outing or whatever KCPA is a good place to be The Godfather highly recommends it 
1GfTXm4lQCDnqsbHZENeMg Urbana The food is excellent I ve been there for both lunch and dinner My only complaint is the noise level can be loud They have done some things to quiet it down though like adding in tapestries Salads are excellent as are the soups and well everything Their guacamole is really good but hard to get at in the tall thin glass they serve it in 
1gtlqhzYezYjIbzlmwuOJg Urbana So let me get this straight I love comics A lot I ve been collecting them for years all while pretending not to be a heinous nerd with little success That said I completely forgot that it was free comic book day this saturday until a friend called me Startled I didnt know where I was going to go to obtain some comicky goodness but the friend told me about G Mart Oh My Thor G Mart is truly the speakeasy of comic book stores as its hidden in the bowels of an unassuming building on Main St in Champaign Once you make it through the winding corridors you find to your delight an unassuming little space filled with amazing nerdy guys and occasionally ladies shooting the shit talkin comics and being nerds I have missed this A lot On Saturday they had free pizza for comic book day And storm troopers And a guy dressed up as Iron Man I am all about this store particularly as we had a 30 minute conversation on the lack of black people in comic nerd culture Hells to the mothereffin yes 
1HBrqwCkkUQYiFJn4yWo3g Urbana How have i not reviewed Mandarin Wok yet I m a U of I alumni and this was the go to place for chinese peeps who wanted authentic yummy chinese food I know it sounds strange that a school in the middle of corn fields could have excellent chinese food but then again it s an engineering school so you know what that means The fried tofu is SO GOOD here I came back 9 years later for a reunion and the fried tofu was still amazing here If possible order off the mandarin menu and not the english menu or at least say you want the chinese style and not american style dishes yes they make it both ways I live in the bay area now and i still say this is one of the best chinese restaurants I ve had and especially for the midwest Definitely better than most places in Chicago 
1Hvlqjv9JJfEYDEtd6Ut-g Urbana I am not Chinese but my boyfriend is and he says this place is close to what his family makes so I believe him That said I ve had a lot of great food here Chen do chili chicken eggplant beef ho fun stir fried bok choy and a fried melon dish are a few of my favorites At first it can be confusing to order and I ve seen a lot of people look overwhelmed by the menu and people milling about the counter I say DON T WALK OUT Ask the lady at the register daughter of chef and she can help you Highly recommend 
1HxP3VwFZ9oHFS4Ovn035g Urbana Hey look it s a cute little cupcake bar It will be interesting to see if this is a success The atmosphere is pleasant but still looks a little unfinished At first glance the menu is expensive 2 50 for a small cupcake and 5 lavender soda However it s about the same price as a beer at the Blind Pig and unlike with the beer I can go to work after eating the cupcake The beautifully decorated cupcakes I tried green tea and salted caramel were good but not quite fantastic I suspect they are still tweaking their recipe The soda I tried was more like sparkling water with a hint of lavender so it didn t really satisfy my craving for that flowery taste and I don t think it was worth 5 My friends did get tea though which came in a beautiful clear teapot with a votive underneath that illuminated the table I noticed that it s open late so it might be a good late night snack for after you hit up the nearby hipster bars 
1IEfmmMPehvt5UGbX9JwTA Urbana There s a lot to like about Kessler Optical Dr Kessler himself is phenomenal the office is comfortable and they have mimosas on Saturdays Still there are some things about the way they do business that leave a bad taste in my mouth First as a new patient you re going to be asked to fill out an EXTENSIVE medical history everything from mental disorders present in your grandparents to what birth control you re on They wanted a more thorough medical history than my general practitioner has I opted to leave a lot of this blank it s okay to tell your eye doctor they re asking for too much info Second buried in the pile of new patient paperwork is a sheet that informs you that their standard yearly eye exam involves three additional components all of which your insurance won t cover and you ll need to pay for out of pocket taking your blood pressure a blood sugar test and a more extensive eye exam I realize that diabetes is a leading cause of blindness but my GP does my bloodwork every year and I m not paying 40 to have it done again The sheet is drawn up without an option that says I decline all three of these services so I had to write that in myself Be warned if you are the sort to fly through your new patient paperwork signing everything in sight you ll be saddled with about 60 of extra services not covered by your insurance Third every time I have left a message on their machine during business hours they haven t called me back on that business day Fourth they re training a new receptionist god I hope she is new and although she s incredibly sweet both times I was checking out I had to wait 10 20 minutes just to get my receipt worked out This meant my entire eye visit took nearly two hours and popping in to pick up my contacts took half an hour I was told there were several emergencies on the day I had my initial appointment which is why it took so long so perhaps this isn t usually the case Fifth my contacts came with a rebate and despite reassuring me that they had given me everything necessary to send in the rebate when I got home I realized they had not I now have to go back out to Kessler a THIRD time in order to get the correct itemized receipt for my rebate Dr Kessler and the other medical staff are fantastic so I m considering giving this another shot but to be frank I don t care how suave or chic the wait room is I want my optometrist visits to be prompt painless and I don t want them to try to squeeze me for extra money by pushing unnecessary services 
1iEIsYFh7csBxzU_cXygug Urbana Eric s got some points I m sure it is good for Campustown to have more stores but it s somewhat nauseating to have left prepackaged hipsterdom on the West Coast and legit hipsterness as well only to run smack into its most bottom line corporate cousin 2 000 miles away It s terrifyingly expensive and annoyingly mass marketed I like many of the things in UO but I m not buying them for 50 when I could find them other places for 5 And when they have all the soul and uniqueness of a suburban mini mansion 
1IIx_UCrS_Ij98D69P_o-A Urbana Overall this place could be good but is just a disappointment They have a great selection of vegetables meats sauces and other ingredients but even when following their recipes the food isn t that great It was extremely salty and just not very impressive I think that the grill maybe got my food mixed up with someone else s food maybe it just wasn t good Overall it was edible but I would never go back for the price I paid for salty mediocre stir fry 
1iLQRVqe6Mh1xI3MKLRaKg Urbana Circles is a GREAT place to find that one of a kind piece Well made fabrics that will last many years with amazing style I love that I know I won t be walking down the street and see 8 people in the same piece of clothing like items you find at the mall Also a great 50 off rack shoe area that I can always find good deals at Thanks Circles 
1Iobyi_7BkFON25Oegs0aw Urbana Love their subs Cheap and top shelf ingredients 
1Iuiw1ZcRV2PkCj5RqPltg Urbana I finally got to try this place yesterday after allowing my curiosity to linger for nearly a whole Spring semester I love cajun spices flavors but this was only okay for me I ordered the Drunken Chicken bowl and while the flavors were pretty good I think I was looking for a little more heat However the portions were generous and if you re looking for something quick dirty this is a satisfying alternative to your typical fast food chains I ll be coming back to try some of the other items on the menu 
1jeOOnRgltiUQ-f6Pdtw_Q Urbana When there were no restaurants in downtown Urbana the Courier was a go to place The food was never spectacular and even the burgers which were a draw back then now when there are other possibilities for having a burger are actually quite greasy and fatty The airplane fan is very nice but can t carry the weight of diner food that isn t even really good diner food The shakes phosphates and sundaes are worth a trip and the cherry pie is nice too Breakfasts do have their fans but in my experience the home fries are always dry the eggs often overcooked or tepid and the it s not worth the wait on a weekend 
1Jt7F0Ckwt2Bs8zxROf8Sw Urbana Can t really state how much I love this place Hang out here a couple times a week as it is where my group of friends have always gone here On weeknights the place is pretty clear perfect for kicking a few back with some friends You often see people bring in laptops to do work over a beer or two It s generally quiet enough for that during the week On weekends it s certainly busier and louder but not unpalatable Music isn t absolutely blasted you can still have a conversation with the person next to you If you are here for food try the Irish nachos Absolutely brilliant 
1j_VVCjq518ou93df2YgvQ Urbana They have this dish called the diner stack wow hashbrowns two eggs sausage patty and gravy all on top of each other I also got a biscuit to go with it I am pretty sure this might be one of the worst possible things to eat health wise but damn was it good I dont think I had lunch that day since it was such a huge meal and great hangover cure The line can get long at this place for breakfast but it moves pretty quick and it worth the wait IMO Service is your typical diner service so not bad 
1k5yA_gXkNZn_LLAt3ZIow Urbana Generally speaking the service is good I ve had some bad ones The food is pretty good but the reason to go is for the brunch It can get crowded but worth the wait They make their desserts on site and make omlettes and waffles while you wait The meats can be overcooked but it s still all quite tasty 
1KbcRXRxMZ4x89HYMTCACw Urbana I have been here twice on a Monday afternoon around 4 30 having a beer and nachos I think the nachos are really good We have always had great service and it s never crowded because of the time obviously However I am not that impressed with anything Maybe I should try more items and then write a review But I also got a ticket while parked in the metered parking lot I know it s my fault for miscalculating but it still pisses me off 
1kFH6sA8sRlvpgZxQ5M4IQ Urbana The campus Gamestop is the only place i go to buy my games Here is why knowledgeable and friendly staff I have to admitt I am a bit of a video game nerd and could talk your head off about companies games and upcoming releases til you passed out from boredom I don t need help in this category but many people do Every time I have come to this particular gamestop the people have been very friendly laid back a big plus in my book yet maintained a proper level of professionalism and customer service that was neither pretentious or overbearing something absent from the mall Gamestop employees Similarly i have witnessed an employee handle difficult situations well here many times from stoned idiots trying to cancel their friend s pre order to dealing with pan handlers asking for handouts INSIDE the store during the lunch rush The employees know what they are doing and do it well Also they are quick to serve your needs no matter the level of rush they are handling Do not go to any C U Gamestop other than this one believe me 
1kwp7_uILTI0uVltyuUM6Q Urbana Pizza puff and cheese fries I LOVE YOU Ate it during a drunken stupor on Friday and it was so delicious I wanted to go back on Sat night 
1LbNRqIczHQ4JzeReouFfQ Urbana I came here after graduating back in May and my experience was pretty lackluster The food itself was decent pretty good when you take into consideration that it s sushi in Central Illinois The problem with this place is the service The place wasn t busy at all yet our waitress seemed a bit frazzled and the service was slow First issue was that we weren t given any napkins and had to ask once we were served food which to be honest isn t a big issue but it took over 30 minutes to get a couple of sushi rolls when the place wasn t busy Our waitress didn t really bother to stop and ask how we were doing during our meal When we were done eating our waitress asked us if we wanted some green tea to which we accepted However she left and didn t come back for about 15 minutes or so with no tea At this point we decided to just ask for the check and leave which took about another 10 minutes although she came back with tea this time If you have the time then Kamakura is a pretty good choice in terms of sushi and I ve had good experiences with their teppan in the past 
1lExalxlgrRQ0J1Py5jtyA Urbana Whenever you ask someone about The Ribeye their response is the same the salad bar their is FABULOUS When the best thing going for a steakhouse is its salad bar this should be a red flag The service is stiff and hurried but efficient The wine list is basically two choices white or red The menu is basically two choices steak or chicken The steak is a decent cut but hardly seasoned and served on hot cast iron skillets that mean your medium rare steak is well by the end of your meal and your medium well is a dried out hockey puck of jerky like ribeye All this while dining in a windowless cinder block building decorated wholly in orange and blue and surrounded by senior citizens equally decorated wholly in orange and blue But yes the salad bar is good 
1LqLuMlDc1cOZe-MoDY-9A Urbana Jarling s how I love you A venerable Chambana institution Jarling s otherwise known as Custard Cup is one of the best things about summers in this East Central Illinois college town It s open from March through mid November or so but during the summer be prepared to wait in line a bit especially at night on the weekends Oh and don t forget it s cash only My favorite is the pumpkin pie snowstorm it is DELICIOUS They have the perfect blend of vanilla custard with bits and pieces of pumpkin pie but it s seasonal so you have to be sure to get it in the fall while it s available I can never pass up an opportunity to drop by Jarling s In fact the last time I was here it was during the break between a friend s wedding ceremony and reception hey now it just happened to be on the way In 3 words OH SO GOOD 
1LsI-HUUWEqG16u4Uj6nYQ Urbana I really enjoy coming to this restaurant The food is generally delicious they have a great selection of appetizers and it s not too expensive I usually order a curry which always comes out deliciously fantastic and I have a love affair with the eggplant tempura Buuuut the last time I dined there I switched it up with a Mock Duck with Basil This dish sounded totally delicious and just to emphasize with the waitress what I wanted I made sure the dish was 100 vegan before proceeding That being said I was hugely disappointed when instead of mock duck with basil I got duck with basil This is after having the waitress double check that the order was vegan and me saying MOCK duck several times as she took my order So there I was a lowly vegan in a usually veg friendly place with a huge slab of dead meat in front of me This upset me far more than I could convey when they finally brought out the real mock somewhat ironic I know duck it was great It may seem like an innocent screw up back in the kitchen but as someone who has devoted the rest of their life to help end the suffering of animals I was no happy camper For this reason I can t give it more than 3 stars Go here you ll have a good meal but be warned the service is frequently slow and your order might get really messed up 
1m-8cvhVsGOVOOCimt-7Gg Urbana Corn Beef Pastrami with fries were gooooood good They serve Green River soda This place knows what s up I m not much of a deserts guy but you have to get their banana split Huge serving Great vanilla taste 
1M-zw9Bgo1Far8c2l8Rw4g Urbana In my two weeks in Champaign I have been here twice and am dreaming about my third visit Why For their beef udon I swear since I haven t found a good pho place this is the best alternative ever On a whim I ordered it and found myself faced with a monster bowl of delicious broth silky beef cabbage and a mound of cooked just right noodles Toss in some tofu or something and it d be yummmy sukiyaki My friends after I left my happy udon haze informed me that the seaweed salad spicy tuna roll and chicken teriyaki were pretty good 
1m0S681-WwgFOnIQh3knzA Urbana If you want a great gourmet cupcake go to the Cake Artists Studio on Bloomington Road They are cheaper and she s an accomplished pastry chef The cupcakes at Cakes are overpriced and not special at all 
1MVFwBqahb4Gon1Qp28vMA Urbana It is a terrible regret that I moved away before I had a chance to become a regular at Golden Harbor I ve been there once and the food was out of this world good You can have the americanized staples which are still good or you can get into the real stuff and just have an amazing meal I wish I could pack this place up and take it with me wherever I go It does have an odd cafeteria style service But it s BYOB which I would love to see more restaurants in C U adopt 
1mx_UbuCnk1nNWhy3P_S8A Urbana Keeping with the theme of a few older reviews below You can t say all merry Ann diners are the same because the 1 on neil street sux s compared to this one This one is cleaner and has a better staff that can actually break Into a smile or 2 Better food better food and better food 
1nPoHE-5qMy-u1P6YRVREQ Urbana There is nothing better than fried food specifically broccoli after some or many drinks at the Pig Service is usually good great considering the fact that they re putting up with a lot of drunken shenanigans Also you can get fried food to go and take it back to the Pig or Mike and Molly s 
1OQDtvX1kxZSSzlz3ZpQZA Urbana Excellent coffee selection knowledgable and friendly staff It s just plain tasty coffee roasted right This is strictly a roastery so there s no on site coffee or espresso but if you can try a cupping they re awesome and you ll learn a lot while you have some fun 
1P-gfTAxaezPycmfkd4hXA Urbana This is fast becoming one of my favorite places to eat The veggies are all very fresh The atmosphere is great I love being able to have a salad and my stir fry 
1PEd39HijoUN48u-KCyUkQ Urbana To begin with I wish Yelp would change the meaning of the stars Two stars is Meh I ve experienced better and three stars jumps to A OK Perkins is somewhere in between The menu for breakfast seems pretty extensive I ordered a platter that included smoked sausage greasy sausage greasy and bland eggs done okay bacon spot on breakfast potatoes pretty good and pancakes so so I like that they leave a pot of coffee on the table rather than having you wait for refills from the wait staff It would have been even better if the pot was full and the coffee was good neither of which was the case My waitress was efficient and personable Seemed more like a pro waitress rather than some of these student types that serve with the attitude that says I m only doing this until I graduate and start my money making career so don t expect much Again not all student wait staff are like that but some are The place seemed clean and it wasn t very busy for a Saturday morning breakfast I ve wanted to try Perkins and must admit i went there today only because Courier Cafe was closed I will return to Perkins as there were some other things on the menu I d like to try and because the experience wasn t completely a bust Although I am usually a member of the Clean Plate Club I did leave behind one piece of smoked sausage a sausage link some potatoes and half the pancakes That says something SECOND VISIT My first reaction holds true the second time The coffee wasn t very good The eggs were okay and the potatoes decent Bacon once again was perfect The muffin french toast was awful and was left unfinished 
1PJqXYWUGaLXcRfROdBQxA Urbana I really only go here for the 1 sushi night can get pretty pricey otherwise Love the monday night sushi specials they make up a menu of 10 rolls that may not be traditional but are absolutely delicious like a grilled kobe beef roll or a roll topped with salsa I always order the sampler a hot sake and some edamame to start off They also have more traditional stuff for purists and a large organic menu of seafood restaurant style dishes Haven t found any other sushi place in town that is as good And it has a really cool almost over trendy atmosphere so it s a place you can go to for a special occasion or just whenever 
1PVIJrhOaXmZD8vkCAT6rQ Urbana I have changed my mind Aroma you are my new favourite coffee shop in CU and not just because you kept me full of coffee and happiness this weekend while I toiled over everything from Marx to historiography Your workers were ridiculously friendly your huge ass coffee mugs were on point and the Beef and Cheddar sandwich was sabroso You win 
1PZIxhdv_DhM5sl34LTTtw Urbana My exhaust broke on my Toyota reds welded a flange and had the car for only an hour and a half and charged 45 dollars it was the best auto repair experience I ve ever had 
1P_rqImy1j37aEzPn0xHdA Urbana I passed by this truck so many times on my way to class Each time I dared myself to try it But I was scared I d never ordered anything from a truck before What if I look dumb Do they take credit What if they only serve construction workers Now I ve eaten there several times I ll give you all the facts 1 OMG YUMMMMMMMMM 2 No credit only cash 3 did I mention OMG YUMMMMMMMMMM All their breakfast options are amazing Even the black bean burger is great It did make me feel like I would probably raise my cholesterol significantly TIP Call in advance on your way from class They take a little time to get you your food But if you call earlier they usually have it ready for me after the 10 min walk over there 
1QBbR9ZGUMiAX4Nj7fsXGA Urbana This place has the smallest selection of womens bikes I have ever seen for its size and literally only one or two small women s road and or hybrid bikes If you re under 5 5 skip this place and go straight to Champaign Cycle which has lots of small Treks to ride if you don t like Trek though you should drive to Bloomington Also they make no effort to adjust your bike to fit you if you buy it there I bought an Electra Townie there and paid full price and only learned later that the handlebars were set WAY too high I could barely reach them and could never curl my fingers around the handlebars without leaning way forward Because I could not yet ride a bike when I bought this one I couldn t test ride but this was something that anyone could have seen who bothered to look at me and look at this bike I later adjusted them myself at home using an Allen wrench but other adjustments were needed that required tools that i don t own which was irritating Also the salesperson tried to wheedle me into riding a bike that was so big for me I couldn t stand over it I also was sold a water bottle holder for my Townie that didn t fit my Townie I was unable to return or exchange it but they offered to give me some shims to make it fit very lame 
1qcWiB6xOv8m8_hjxg7oiQ Urbana I was waffling between a 4 and a 5 on this place out of the 3 times I ve been here but last night really pushed me to a 5 We came for a birthday party we had a reservation for 6 but it wound up being 8 and they accommodated us with no questions asked 1 at around 6 on a Saturday and there were only 2 other tables seated in the restaurant Service started out a little shaky our waiter was quite young but nothing to complain about really Once we were all seated and had our orders placed the evening just went really smoothly which is really how parties at restaurants should be I think Though the rolls took a while to come out we all ordered sushi in one form or another we were sent out first a round of complimentary miso soup and then trays of beautifully presented banchan or Japanese food presented in banchan style Our sushi came out pretty much all at the same time though the waiter forgot one of my friend s second roll order until the end I ve only had the sushi here so I can t speak for the hot food but it is very fresh tasting and has clean flavor profiles It seems to be that the majority of the rolls are dominated by fish and veggies rather than cream cheese tempura style rolls which is a nice break from some of the other restaurants in town In my opinion the rolls are on the pricey side 6 for a simple maki to avg 13 for a special but I come from the land of cheap fish so Yellowfin is competitive for the market in town Finally the chef sent out some tempura bananas topped with mango sauce and caramel If you ve not had a tempura banana you re really missing out I guess what impressed me the most was 1 how seamless the service integrated with the table s needs and 2 the effort put into the presentation and quality of the food We were able to enjoy our night out without having to worry too much about really anything everything just flowed The sushi was beautifully presented with beautiful pieces of fish as well as intricately carved garnishes Bottom line When a sushi craving hits any day other than a Sunday or Monday I ll be headed to Yellowfin 
1qFejgmvU7-4eV5_WCb3yg Urbana Great museum on a terrific college campus I know it doesn t get the attention the sports facilities do but it should Check it out next time you are in C U It is a great way to recharge your batteries and let the power of art soothe your soul 
1rhnMkY5hgSMJDgnpoilGg Urbana The only custard I am familiar with is flan but what s this It comes in ice cream form too A taste of heaven in a cup they need to rename this place Heavenly Custard Cup I used to think DQ had the best blizzards i e tropical and Hawaiian but the custard component did it for me in the form of snowstorms thus The Custard Cup has moved up on my list I don t remember the name of the flavor I ordered but it had fruit and nuts and was absolutely positively amazing I would recommend sharing only if it s not your first time because this stuff can be extremely heavy on smaller digestive systems I was full after about 5 6 tablespoonfuls of the size small snowstorm then felt nauseous after but that didn t stop me I kept on eating bc it was sooo good but then still couldn t finish I do wish they had written descriptions somewhere of each flavor bc I felt bad having to ask the worker to describe every other flavor on their never ending list Like moonlight star dusk wtf I don t remember exactly but just weird names that don t give a clue I know the regulars must be like geez woman quit shilly shallying and make up your mind already but I need to make sure I don t get any surprise raisins or cinnamon I definitely would like to try their pies next time also 
1RjaaVrPfMwO0_TgnUU_4Q Urbana I am writing this review for Shelly the esthetician I have worked with Shelly for about 5 years now Even though I don t live in Urbana every time I visit I get my eyebrows done I have tried many places in Chicago and been very unhappy with the results She really really listens and does a great job She did my brows for my wedding and she is the only person that I trust She is also GREAT at bikini waxes too I definitely recommend her She is the BEST there is 
1R_xb40BO5MhZaWScBCNeQ Urbana As the previous reviewer Bailey stated nice clean store brightly lit I wanted one of those soft cloths for cleaning eyeglass they had none I had to buy a package 30 count of these wet eyeglass wipes in the foil packs Also picked up some Rolaids as I ran out and a comb to replace my missing comb 
1s0CgL1WeHKEwltOoTc0HA Urbana Papaya salad is very tasty nice lunch VERY tiny restaurant we got there during the lunch rush took a while to get our food In the meantime some free range children you know the kind that are fed and clothed but not raised were raising hell at the next table while their oblivious mother enjoyed her soup My husband while paying our bill innocently opened the front door and let the children escape They instantly when running down the sidewalk the mother chased them down and brought them back into the restaurant 
1S2abZGeHdCAoco0sK_l_g Urbana Gimme a break this is an imitation Mexican restaurant run by McDonalds I m from Urbana and I live in a very competitive place for mexican food San Diego CA The best thing that can be said about the food is a Its not expensive for the amount you get b It s unlikely to cause indigestion and c If you ve never tried mexican before this won t turn you away forever Otherwise compared to many other mexican fast food restaurants this one is highly forgettable Example L S CA West Coast much better a 5 star fast food mexican restaurant Example R National much better a little pricier than the one above and salsas not as good a 4 star fast food mexican restaurant and a publically traded company Example T B National Ok it s not really mexican but I enjoy their imaginary mexican creations such as the 7 layer burrito and their chalupas 3 stars 
1Tc9Y65WSins9jlWdKLIjQ Urbana All I want is for this place to do well It deserves it Basically if you survive the terrifyingly steep steps downstairs you ll enter what appears to be a speakeasy beneath the Unitarian Center And by speakeasy I don t mean Prohibition Chicago era hideouts for liquor runners I mean a Vegetarian Speakeasy for hippies the best kind of speakeasy The decor is eclectic and homemmade It basically looks like a co op and is inhabited by the usual college town cast of characters hipsters professors crunchy folk punkers and any person who likes great food I enjoyed my butternut squash bisque soup and was disappointed that they were out of cornbread today Keep that in mind and come relatively early to avoid having them run out of foodage Otherwise you should enjoy Go and at least check out this awesome local community spot that really seems to care about the area around it Good call One note they only take cash much like the Y Thai But really if you re eating on campus you should spend your money on places like Y Thai or Red Herring rather than the soulless corporate eateries lining Green Street in CampusTown And there s free wifi Hot damn 
1tWrpU9-vPOYP7em0_T-PQ Urbana So many lovely memories of going here twice a week at least with my boy We would order strictly from the Korean Menu if memory serves me right intestine shaped like squirrel anyone Excellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment 
1uoxcLw4wPrjH8fpB2XeWQ Urbana If you own a jeep or SUV and want a mini off road adventure within Champaign Urbana look no further than Papa Del s parking lot Parents be sure to watch your children very carefully when it s raining as there is no lifeguard on duty All kidding aside their pizza is great I usually go over the noon hour and pick up a slice of their sausage or mushroom pizza as a whole pizza is way too much for a singleton like me Highly recommended if you haven t tried it 
1Vd6P1db4CGsxoc8dd_TIg Urbana If you go to Sam s you probably already know what you re going for It s not for ambiance or subtle flavors or lunch it s for delicious breakfast food It s not exactly a new trend to sing the praises of small greasy spoon style places but there is a reason for that no 30 fancy brunch can ever really inspire the same satisfaction that getting gratifyingly greasy french toast pancakes sausage and hash browns for a few dollars can 
1vpouSOwSaN888rQIkFiTQ Urbana Very good beef and salmon burgers Fresh food good service Not loaded with smelly college kids either A great find My daughter loved her caesar salad too so we were 4 for 4 across the table in truly liking our meals Fresh brewed iced tea always nice 
1VqCd4KU1RMRcU92To1kZQ Urbana I fell in love with their red velvet a few months back Then I went back for their white chocolate macadamia nut the cake was tasteless and the frosting was sugary like always I couldn t bring myself to finish it Then I went to a cupcake place back home and their red velvet does not even compare It was so moist and rich Ahh now I feel like Cakes on Walnut is a lie I ll still probably go back to Cakes on Walnut when I m desperate for fix or if they start throwing in a glass of milk for free 
1VRoQl5ZqUlqUYrxa4ixtA Urbana Two words Pokey Sticks 5 stars for Pokey Sticks And yes on multiple occasions I have driven from Chicago to Champaign for a box of Pokey Sticks My college friends from FAR sometimes join me and we finish the box driving back on I 57 Yeah we act like we never graduated while eating the stuff For a Super Bowl party I went and bought several boxes much to the enjoyment of UIUC alumni present Too bad the Bears lost but the taste of Pokey Sticks softened the blow When I get the craving I would do the drive again in a heartbeat Who s in 
1wwBnefZofDE-5pzkDvtLA Urbana Garcia s was pizza at the University of Illinois for decades Ask any alum and they ll have memories of the squares that were served there and many more used to steal the nice plastic tray they came in as it worked well at home for microwaving They had a bit tomato hot air balloon they use to fly around campus on football weekends and some branch stores in Big 10 campus towns like Purdue Sadly Garcia s fell on hard times in the 90s They lost their flagship store right across from the Quad and folks had to hike a bit down Green Street to get their fix They then started skimping on ingredients switching to a pre made crust and other cost saving measures as the company went through hard times Alums still go back as it tastes a bit like it used to but new students generally are unimpressed and look toward other options The crust is kind of unique sometimes I wonder if it is fried and they had a good number of toppings that you could get on them Pizza by the slice is really a walk up kind of business model so when they lost their high traffic location they really suffered financially You used to eat there just to people watch Still worth visiting for old time sake and I hope they get back on their feet and get going again 
1X7kVjEtRrd8Mp6_RLHcmw Urbana Best bar food in campus town I always get battalian burger The bartender s here are fantastic I really love the service here and I always come here with friends when they visit I feel the negative service complaints may be from wiper packed weekends like dads weekend or homecoming where every bar will be backed up I love this bar and many of my college memories came from here 
1xdMPeKZJ0jDKhzGCgyBOQ Urbana I strongly recommend that you do NOT shop here These people are rude and a fraud I have read that one way wedding shops defraud unsuspecting sometimes vulnerable brides is by tag ripping That means that they remove a tag from a garment so that the customer will not know the brand of the dress This can be beneficial to the dress shop because they can charge more for the garment than it is clearly worth tricking a customer into thinking they are buying a designer gown not a discount gown and they can make if difficult for a costumer to find the gown at other stores Personally I have run into this twice I have been shopping with a friend who was getting married and the employees refused to disclose the brand of any of the dresses she asked about Additionally I needed a specific undergarment as suggested to me by a seamstress and in my desperation I called Ducky s I asked if they carried a certain brand of corsets and the person on the phone refused to answer my questions I explained that my seamstress had recommended a specific brand and described it to him so he could tell me if they carried anything similar His response Maybe you should just buy it from your seamstress And he hung up I was being polite it s my personal policy and this man hung up on me For the love all things holy don t patronize these fools 
1XK2nMXrUcOv6ODf1UqJNw Urbana Guinness on tap Automatic 3 stars from me On top of that there was no cover on a Friday night for those of us over 21 Another star for that Legends is a pretty laid back bar where you can get together with friends and have a couple drinks Not really the type of place to dance but there s Joe s and Cly s if that s what you re looking for In addition to Guinness on tap they had a handful of other beers as well as a pretty extensive bottled beer list Prices were reasonable too 4 75 for a Dead Guy and 4 50 for a Killians Another bonus was that the bartender serving me was very cute Definitely will be back in the future to grab a beer with some friends and watch some games 
1xKkbZz8LyzFIxQfkCZy0A Urbana I don t know why people don t like the wings here I actually think they are outstanding Maybe there s a different set of wings from the fried sweet and spicy honey wings I don t often eat fried food but these wings have a delicate crunch and they are covered with this great sauce There s honey of course and hot pepper flakes and possibly ginger my friend and I are dying to try and replicate this taste I went today and since I had gotten my refund check decided to splurge I had the lime soda which was delicious and refreshing and homemade not too sweet We split the aforementioned wings which are moist and delicious and spring rolls which were crunchy and fresh and held together well My friend and I also got banh mi which I have never had before I got mine with garlic beef and was rewarded with soft crunchy bread a subtle bite of pickled veggies and tender savory bits of beef I thought it was really tasty There was a lot of bread though and I m not sure it was much different from a normal baguette I could buy I understand that banh mi is supposed to be on bread with rice and wheat flour so I expected it to be a little lighter Everything was really good though In fact I know that in the warmer months they offer vermicelli bowls and I can t wait to try that I also want to come for 5 pho on Wednesday Yum One weird thing I d love it if we got some plates with our appetizers I always end up making a mess 
1Yk8uU8nza9f54L5wDDobg Urbana While the value is pretty good the burritos are not really that huge come on people be real and their quality is very low Every type of meat I ve had there has been dry and stringy the beef in particular was barely edible The burritos sometimes aren t even assembled that solidly which may be due to the size but still they shouldn t fall apart and have such a messy puddle of dripping in the bottom of every wrapper I ve been here 3 times and I m never going back It s a step above generic Americanized places like Qdoba and Chipotle but it s still really really low quality food for drunk people who can t tell the difference Go to Los Amigos if you want decent Mexican food on Green Street 
1yLfWWG9l23BilsYmOKx1Q Urbana This company is all things horrible I ve ridden with Suburban Express probably about 20 25 times within the past four to five years and about half of those times have been pretty horrendous For example I have had drivers who blast the radio for the entire duration of the ride drivers who insult passengers for putting their luggage in the wrong compartment drivers who further insult passengers for being two minutes EARLY for the scheduled departure time a driver told a passenger he was late and screamed at him to just get on the bus and my last two favorite experiences a driver who got lost en route to campus and a driver who pulled over in Ashkum to use the bus s bathroom for over five minutes According to Suburban Express drivers are not supposed to stop the bus once it s en route to its destination See a pattern here Although this company is reliable for students without transportation to get to and from the suburbs their drivers really need to be evaluated for performance and personality Don t get me started on their marketing practices Although it s true that LEX Express is a shockingly worse company than Suburban Express Suburban Express s entire marketing strategy is to insult their competition and post flyers about how many times a LEX bus has crashed or broken down on I 57 Once upon a time Suburban Express used to have a round trip special of something like 39 90 now a round trip with them costs 55 This is truly a company that takes complete advantage of its clientele Suburban Express was great when they used to hand out coupons on campus not just in the dorms and started bus tickets at 1 each Unfortunately this business doesn t care about the students who rely on their service and don t mind when they arrive upwards to half an hour after the scheduled arrival time Oh yeah they used to give out 7 coupons if they were late Whatever happened to that However Illini Shuttle the offshoot company from Suburban Express is refreshing and employs friendly drivers who seemingly care about getting to and from each stop on time I suggest riding with them if you know you won t have to use the bathroom for three hours And last but not least the owner is a mentally ill lunatic who creates insane policies in which you basically have to sign your rights away upon purchasing a Suburban Express bus ticket And god forbid you ever write a negative review criticizing their company s faults you get banned for life 
1YVnGVCj7cv14aXsbO3o3Q Urbana Just your run of the mill fast food place Staffed by new people constantly it s not the best place to walk up to the counter and ask for a recommendation As far as Dairy Queens go though this one is just fine My orders have always turned out right and the blizzards always well mixed If you re looking for a quick guilty treat you can get it here 
1YYnd8eDdTG3egNQGhan9A Urbana The modern atmosphere is good for a date night or just hanging out with friends This place has traditional sushi as well as very unique choices as the name would suggest My favorite is definitely the Fusion Maki though it is a little pricey I definitely think it s worth the price because it s a meal in itself Also they have a great 1 sushi deal on Sundays and Mondays The menu is a little pricey though if you re not going on their 1 sushi nights 
1y_hEV8_gQP0mO7ByKfkMw Urbana I took my Dad here when he was visiting I was expecting it to be expensive but also to be a solid dining experience Sure it is one of the few very nice restaurants on campus but from now on I will go off campus to eat nice meals The food was okay The dishes were pretty small for the price Worst of all was the service It took forever to get anything done and while the waittress was very nice it was unpleasant Also it was too loud for my Dad and I to talk which was our main intention Lastly this was in the winter and there was a huge draft whenever anybody entered the restaurant that forced us to put our jackets on 
1zMpN2KvRVgZIzhwi9haBA Urbana Table side guacamole making was very good Nothing like watching fresh items being prepared Food was tasty and service was quick Salsa was a little spicy just like it should be 
1_3HEQWaafnH6a3y4rLQjQ Urbana The best part of eating at Siam Terrace is the historic Knights of Pythias Building in which it is located Tin ceilings 16 feet high add to the drama And the owner and his family are great folks We had an all sushi sashimi dinner and the boat presentation was a work of art The miso soup is perfectly prepared 
1_G3JncYvTpGqnRverpStA Urbana Oh god Clybourne s glorified undergrad house party Seriously it was like college parties all over again Shoving through a packed dance floor avoiding being stepped on by the people shoving through the packed dance floor dancing awkwardly with one eye on the couple grinding behind you to avoid being hit by their wild gyrations and weak drinks that you chug in the hopes that it ll somehow make the whole experience fun I wanted to try out the only other place in the area with a decent dance floor the other is Soma but since this place is on campus I should ve known it d be like well a glorified undergrad house party Which is totally fine if that s what you re in the mood for I unfortunately graduated two years ago and so have already had my fill of college parties Oh except this party also charges 5 cover Anyway music isn t bad and there s a pretty cool multi floor layout with plenty of bars The drinks though are absolutely pathetic aka standard for on campus bars I was voted one shot wonder of my sorority and the drinks here got me at best mildly happy and at worst wondering why I paid so much for just juice soda insert mixer of your choice So after a night of downing weak drinks dancing awkwardly and getting my ass grabbed I think it s safe to say I ll be sticking with Soma At least there the drinks are real I ll be tipsy enough to enjoy dancing on a packed dance floor and if I must get my ass grabbed at least most of the time it won t be by guys who re younger than me 
1_rx6vOJHS3wJ5HCjfqJfQ Urbana Went here once for lunch with co workers Seemed to be like just a little sandwich soup salad plus bakery type of place The food was average at best Unfortunately the reason for the low review was the price I paid something like 8 for a sandwich on two of the smallest slices of sourdough bread I ve ever seen and a handful of chips I felt ridiculously ripped off and was left feeling hungry Actually quite a few of my co workers with more money in their pockets ended up buying seconds just to fill their appetites It took a little while for the food to come out as well The sandwich wasn t bad just very average and ridiculously overpriced Soup and salad were the same I ll be staying away 
2-igE6hTkHRzgE3IPyUfxQ Urbana I eat here semi frequently because there is a lack of mid range priced restaurants in town that aren t thai chinese korean etc and this has some meals that I would classify as mid range in price i e about 8 for a meal plus tip and tax I think the food is ok but some of the stuff on the menu is just overpriced 
20q76pyZ__FYB5dX-SLQAw Urbana This is a local chain of oil change shops that blows away the national chains They are fast courteous and do good work without trying to sell you a bunch of crap you don t need Additionally they treat female customers with respect Their prices are lower than their competitors yet the overall value that they deliver is much higher I cannot recommend this business enough 
213FXdSegrq22YmwsdWeIA Urbana Hitting the big 5 0 0 with a great restaurant from my hometown The vitals Downtown microbrewery restaurant with a slightly hip industrial vibe Great food great beer Best part Small 4oz tasting portions 1 2 GREAT service Every time I visit my parents in good ol Chambana they have a new restaurant in town that hubby and I MUST try Or five This time Destihl was first on their list and they are so crazy about it they took us twice In ONE DAY First for lunch No beer this visit hence the second just lunch I had the Portabella Sandwich with Shoestring Fries and it was 100 delish Also on the table Stuffed poblano pepper Cuban sandwich Salad with ahi tuna Clam chowder I heard nothing but raves from the group Late that evening we stopped in for post dinner drinks and maybe a little to munch on We got three appetizers for the table Chorizo Potato Flautas Marinated Cucumbers there s some BITE to those suckers Brewmaster s Pizza yuuuuuumm and all got a few 4oz tasting pours The beer was fantastic some of the best I ve had Our waiters both times were friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the story my dad told more than once about his friend s first visit They were a big group 12 I think and stopping in before seeing a show in downtown They ordered food drinks then dessert There was a delay in the kitchen and they were kept waiting on their dessert for quite while they were now running short on time so one of the guys flagged down their waiter and told him maybe a touch rudely that they needed either dessert or the check because we gotta get out of here The manager came back a couple of minutes later apologized profusely and served their dessert Dessert or check and Destihl chose dessert Their meal and drinks for 12 were on the house It s those kinds of stories that spread your business name in the best possible way you chose wisely Destihl The guy s been sending over everyone he knows always prompting with you gotta hear how amazingly this restaurant treated me 
214LfiZqcj1PWdOM6auQYw Urbana This place makes no qualms about itself It is a solid Punjabi joint creamy curries paneer and all That said it s rather lacking in spicy inspiration both locations didn t feature any sort of kick to their curries However the lunch special is all bang for your buck I recently went here on a lunch meeting and my professor and I were able to split one plate and leave completely stuffed I m glad the only real traditional Punjabi Indian joint in C U isn t a disaster but it s nothing to write home about either 
22bOyxoN-JSPtFlKsvDhbQ Urbana I was excited to try Peking Garden after reading numerous positive reviews from here and other sites I finally had the opportunity to try it out after suggesting it to a roommate over other options Since I ve reviewed another Chinese restaurant and hope to continue doing so I decided it would be best to get the same dish General s Chicken I know this is not traditional Chinese but it is a common dish and is one of my favorites The first difficulty I had with Peking Garden is ordering They do not have a website and it is not easily found online Luckily I was able to find one on campusfood com Next I noticed that the entrees were sort of expensive my dish was 10 90 with tax This isn t too outrageous as the portions were relatively large but there are plenty of other cheaper options in the area After finding the menu and placing the order over the phone I was told it would only be about 10 minutes until our food was ready When we arrived around 10 minutes later our food was waiting for us at the front counter One thing that I did not care for right away was that the rice for both of our orders was included in one container This isn t a huge deal but would have been easier for us had they been separate My meal had pretty good flavor though it wasn t as spicy as other places Despite the flavor both my roommate and I noticed that the chicken was tough to the point it was chewy This is probably the biggest reason for my 3 star rating as almost all other Chinese I have had has been very tender Overall the meal was good but I doubt that I will be returning to Peking Garden anytime soon 
22E1z4PoyMRCm82aKdaYKg Urbana I had a great time at this bar I saw a local blues band Kilborn Ally who were very good and there was a opening band whose name I never caught but was equally as excellent By the end of the night the two bands were switching off members and members of other local blues bands would come on stage and play a song Overall probably one of the best nights of music I have seen in Champaign The location isn t bad near the the green bus line a few blocks south of downtown Champaign It is a local bar I think my friends and I were the only ones under 30 there that night I think this is just because of a lack of knowledge by the general younger community Great dive feel lots of NASCAR stuff pool tables nothing on tap all cans and bottles Pabst was 2 a can and bud tallboys were 4 I want to try it out on a night where there isn t a great band playing but if your feeling ambitious for a dive in C U I would try this place out 
22hLKTEJIwk7BH30mhxR6w Urbana I m definitely what you would consider an occasional golfer and do so for fun I m not great but have the occasional par Just found this course a couple weeks ago and it s been lots of fun It s a very basic 9 hole course with two par 4 and 7 par 3 s It s definitely a walkable course but I opt for the 6 dollar cart Cus Well It s fun The course itself is in decent shape The tee boxes could use some work and it would be nice if the holes were numbered Also some tee markers are missing There is a few ponds of water which keeps it a little interesting but you won t run into any trees out here as it was built in an corn field The driving range is pretty basic and hits into hole 6 which is a little scary since lots of people get their drivers out and I ve seen a few range balls on that hole while we golf I think they could use a net or something across to protect the golfers just in case The driving range is also heated in the winter but I haven t used it They also have a grill and patio furniture outside im assuming so you could have a party or outing there Overall a pretty relaxed atmosphere for beginners to practice their game Staff is very friendly And helpful each time I m there 
23a2v6nyptInUgXF-QEkJg Urbana For those of you who hate to read long reviews which I like to write here s a too long didn t read version New decor new dance floor new seating pretty awesome Local DJs who play decent dance music Go here if you like to dance or at least attempt Otherwise avoid The drink specials are pretty awesome especially Tues and Thurs The bartenders are cool until a ton of people show up Nice crowd though it can get packed Get here before 10 if you want to avoid a line and before 8 30 if you want to avoid cover Note This bar doubles as a coffee shop during the day but I don t drink coffee so I cannot review that part of it This bar closed down in 2007 for renovation and reopened in Spring 2009 And wow is there a difference The space has been optimized There is more seating than there used to be and it has that new Champaign club smell Even now in 2010 it still sets itself apart from other dancing bars in the area In fact this bar seems DESIGNED for dancing Though there is a lot of seating the people tend to filter to the dance floor in the back of the bar The dance floor is not actually particularly large and it is clich from the dark room to the rotating lights to the stripper poles in the corner But its clich done right The DJs tend to be local though recently DJ Flipside from Chicago has made several appearances but are they are generally pretty good at giving the people the dance music that they want and keeping them in a dancing mood They tend to have a large number of songs and in general unless requested will not repeat a song once in the night One thing that does bother me is that many of the DJs seem to have a problem with playing anything hip hop and no this new electronica R B fusion craze is not considered hip hop I don t know if this is because it s harder to mix than the normal boom chic boom chic boom base beats that all dance music seems to be made out of these days or if they are trying not to attract a certain clientele which doesn t really work The music is played pretty loud but in my opinion it isn t overbearing If you re looking for a bar to just talk to people though you should prob go down the street to Murphy s I have to say that the bathrooms are pretty decent I have never been in this place when the bathrooms were a complete disaster though I m sure it happens The drink specials are nice in my opinion Tuesdays are wine night where you can get bottles for 8 Thursdays are 2 Skyy Wild Turkey and chaser night And even Saturdays the pricing is decent There isn t very much selection but welcome to campus bars You ll have to go to downtown Champaign for that You will pay 5 cover from essentially Weds to Saturday night The bartenders on uncrowded days are surprisingly personable though expectedly this dies off as the crowd gets larger There have been times where they can take forever to get back to getting you a drink but for me this has been pretty rare The clientele in there ranges from nerds to the simply fratastic But in my opinion it tends to cover the whole gamut of those who like dance music Girls that tend to frequent this bar seem to be pretty friendly to me I never did the random hookup thing though so I don t know how your luck will fare if that s your ultimate goal for the night It can get really crowded really quickly and sometimes it can take a bit of time to get from one side of the place to the other To ensure that you get in without waiting in a line for an hour get here before 11pm preferably before 10 If you want to avoid cover get here before 8 All in all if you like a lot of dancing combined with decent drinks at a reasonable price The Clybourne is the place to be It s not the most amazing bar I ve ever been to but it s pretty high up on the list bang for buck 4 5 stars If you are interested here is their website complete with drink specials http www theclybourne com 
23pMaTyFZHq3Nz-609TwXg Urbana I ve lived in CU for 8 years visited both Merry Ann s locations at least three times and never had a decent bite of food Skip it and go to McDonald s 
2432TxhVyCVSEJjcbnjvVg Urbana I had a great experience at Illini Oil Change Despite the yelp reviews I went for the first time and I found the technicians to be more than courteous helpful and gracious Their prices beat area quotes and they were very fast They even tried to offer discounts and asked if I had any coupons How many places these days actually try to save money for you I m not a student anymore but I still will continue to go to support this place in the future 
24mvUEvT8wcqtpCCtBVy5w Urbana Cute animals from elephants to donkeys pre election Which one are you heck if it s yummy I ll be both Their dark chocolate bars are pretty cheap and pretty yummy I think I m going to make this a regular pit stop from now on The guy at the counter s pretty nice and patient too though I guess this is the trend in small towns like Champaign 
25XOo9s3i1FT1FMzUaZXzg Urbana The best Mexican food in Champaign Urbana 
26WePdMt_GQuMZGfSCTmPQ Urbana When I read the positive reviews on Yelp I expected to fall in love with Bevier Cafe After going to Bevier Cafe yesterday with a couple of friends the good news is that I don t dislike the place We arrived a few minutes before the cafe closed and they were out of some of their entrees The food we got seemed to have been sitting out for a while and it wasn t as tasty as I anticipated Also their service seems kind of disorganized you take a tray tell the people at the counter what you want pay for it go sit down with an empty tray and then the employees bring you your food Couldn t they just hand the food over the counter Or just have real servers Even with the not as good as expected food and the confusing service I like the concept of Bevier Cafe I m happy to support a student university run restaurant and I will eat there again 
27kb_wGAdGuZV5iQAEx79A Urbana i will never understand this place the ice cream is horrible and yet there is a ready supply of college kids waiting to eat it the gimmick of watching someone add the bling to your ice cream seems to overshadow the actual taste of the end result i guess if you add enough accessories nobody will notice that the binding agent is worse than generic ice cream served in the dormitory cafeterias oh i just figured it out i get it now 
28lHUVRJ_ir_YvqHTBGwPg Urbana Sadly Bar Guiliani no longer exists It was the best coffee shop in campus town The space is now part of Murphy s 
28LS2fTx3QjJ4oVzbU0R_A Urbana I used to be more impressed with the Common Ground Food Co Op I mean they have a few select organic or special natural items you can t find elsewhere but the service diminishes the experience First of all for the longest time a woman who works there with very long hair would follow me around and keep an eye on me and my husband demeaning us with an insulting special treatment I saw her many times pretending to be busy counting products on a shelf when clearly she was watching me It was infuriating I spend hundreds of dollars there For God s sakes I had to ignore her behavior constantly Eventually the long haired woman figured out we were just shopping and quit her behavior But there are problems with other members there One guy with blue eyes and glasses who works as a cashier told me to put stuff back on the shelf O K that s not my job buddy If I decide not to buy a product and I decide to leave it on the counter that s not my problem How insulting Oh by the way do NOT eat their nectarines they are covered with large and various sized brown fruit flies I talked to one of the cashiers about it and he meekly muttered yeah the fruit goes bad quickly and I suggested that they use one of their own fruit fly traps and he didn t really say much he was like yeah we should but it didn t seem like he was taking it seriously Their selection is ok but Natural Gourmet is better The owner there is nicer and they don t have weird people acting strangely and giving you special treatment 
28MW4VK4zg_7BUA4vffc4w Urbana The food is really fresh and delicious but you ll find yourself bumping elbows with your neighbor a lot if you get caught in one of their periodic mealtime rushes Their kitchen is larger than their dining area There is also no bike parking here at all but even that cannot dissuade me from repeatedly patronizing the best Mexican restaurant in town They are vegetarian friendly Try their delicious corn smut Maize if you are reading this Get some bike parking Seriously 
28xEtAJN-ojheDxhA_3vDg Urbana Sam s Cafe has a Lebanese dinner menu now like Amanda W said which includes the staples such as hummos with a delicious puddle of olive oil crispy falafel Greek salad chock full of feta overstuffed dolmades tabbouleh baklava not homemade w pistachios Two highly recommended plates you can order are the Shish Taouk chicken kebab or Breaded Tilapia one of their specials The woman who started the menu recently emigrated to the US after the tragedy in Lebanon Go support local business 
29bTtecbMkl7SYdSmThZzQ Urbana Dark and close this pub makes me feel as if I might turn a corner to find Christopher Marlowe and some theater pals celebrating an opening performance I love the darkness and all the wood the nooks and the large enclosed booths You could plan a Guy Fawkes plot in one of those Beer selection is very good there were a few entries on the menu which were new to me That hardly happens anymore Unfortunately they were out of my preferred choice but with a selection like this it s no problem to come up with another On a Saturday night around 11 pm the place wasn t crowded which earns big points in my book 
29dTPXCsVVpccl6VUBPXtw Urbana Close to campus Unbelievably friendly staff Very good breakfast in the morning cereal milk juice toast bagel eggs bacon fries fruit more and more very well appointed rooms good TV not LCD CRT and 60 channels including HBO very comfortable beds very clean good shower very good water pressure unlike the other persons experience overall a comfortable stay highly recommended for both business and leisure 
2acR44ODRFhNEvUpPK33Gg Urbana Just recently got my curly hair cut here by Ethan He did an outstanding job I wanted to try something new bangs but was a little skeptical that it could work with my hair type He really listened to my wants and worries and worked with me to find a great style that would show off my curls He s actually a really smart guy and a curly hair expert He also explained to me what kind of products are best for my hair He didn t talk my head off like some stylists do but made me feel comfortable and relaxed Yes the prices are high for a college student s budget but definitely worth it My hair hasn t ever looked this great and for once I didn t cry after a cut 
2AdawVZPfmCtlwDXgfyUWQ Urbana I can t help but feel this Restaurant has fooled many While I ve read the food described as Authentic Italian I felt it was anything but I ve been to Italy and this ISN T Italian I suppose the entire visit was lackluster The decor had a lot to be desired but the wait staff were great However once we ordered wine and by the old menu at least were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass things went downhill While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar When questioned we were told they asked for doubles Who orders a double Merlot We chose what appeared to be a special at the time a smoked duck panini What arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich No I m not complaining about the sandwich itself but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck then claimed that I wouldn t know the difference I m not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me but I ll never return 
2an9hRVNxseMvjyBVlGt3g Urbana Despite the big boom of multiplex theaters Boardman s single screen theater is still going strong You can expect affordable concessions and movie tickets If you so desire you may purchase your ticket s in advance or checkout the upcoming flicks on their website http www boardmansarttheatre com 
2AZMsdJ5-X4Rikn62Ado3g Urbana If I lived in Champaign I would be in trouble World Harvest is amazing Take every single ethnic market you can find and put them all together Add an olive bar artisan cheeses fresh baked breads and all of the worldly chocolate you can handle including kinder chocolate and Mozart balls and you have World Harvest They not only have spices and dry noodles but a large selection of frozen ethnic foods a wall of balsamic vinegars and olive as well as other oils ad did I mention the chocolates They also had a bulk nut and dried fruit selection to choose from Jordan Almonds scare me but I digress The bakery items looked freshly made and the staff was very friendly They will let you try any of the deli cheese or olive selections before you purchase 
2Bh8IVQFtYbmlVYGmJuYfg Urbana Just walked there after walking across the street from the Hampton Inn Glad I went there the food was fairly authentic and tasty I got the fajitas for about 11 which included chicken and shrimp The salsa was zesty and flavorful I would recommend it 
2BoSYIBb5sZSWLCYjTZrwA Urbana Stock items on the shelves are pricey I pretty much come here exclusively for the fresh baked bread You can get a still warm to the touch baguette for 1 45 
2bVlRdYpbTJRLJ1dIsZOqA Urbana While UIUC seems to have plenty of chinese take out joints and pizzerias along Green Street there is a surprisingly small concentration of restaurants that specialize in true Chicago style hot dogs Sadly though the Hot Dogs are just ok While the hot dog itself was a typical vienna beef sausage that I am used to the condiments were second rate Especially the onions which are grilled rather than raw Maybe it s just a personal preference but eating a hot dog with grilled onions just isn t the same The fresh cut french fries however were outstanding and thankfully they come free with everything making this place a good pick if you are looking for an incredibly cheap meal 
2cnc8oaJbtsWgxTFNE-s2Q Urbana Jarling s is quite the summer afternoon and evening delight I ll always order 2 vanilla dips in a waffle bowl made fresh everyday with COLD fudge they only acceptable form of fudge on a sundae and bananas on top and I m never disappointed I am sorry to say they don t carry a S mores Snowstorm yet buy some graham crackers and chocolate chips you guys They only accept cash or check as a form of payment so save up some pennies and head over to get some of the best custard in town before they are closed for the season Stock up for the wintertime 
2CNLaafTmLCYqrp6_e0Qjw Urbana I love Crane Alley They have a great selection of sandwiches at reasonable prices and the best beer selection in town I find the Friday Saturday specials are always creative and amazing You can t go wrong with the frequently offered Beef Ragout Nachos but bring 2 3 people to help you finish Seating outside is quite pleasant except then you miss interacting with the friendly bartenders inside The service is friendly with just the right amount of attentiveness and they are nice to our dogs 
2dBdz4JPtI-aSdYvtQtQVQ Urbana Awesome range of food and beer and the atmosphere is nice This place has to be one of my top 5 in Champaign Urbana especially in the summer when you can sit in the actual alley itself Not to mention this place is great for some low key billiards and beer after dinner 
2DqF8B5RpXlqRNZnewBBAg Urbana This is a great hole in the wall place It isn t the easiest to find if you haven t already been there They have a lot of good food and the service is very courteous I have been here several times and only had problems once it was just waiting a while to get the check which can happen when it gets busy 
2e5ldmyi7S2xvm7GX--mHw Urbana I came here for lunch and had the seafood risotto Based on the atmosphere and the reputation of the restaurant I had pretty high expectations Unfortunately the meal was very average and rather on the bland side The desserts on the other hand were outstanding This place probably deserves another shot but based on this one experience I am feeling underwhelmed 
2E7unFUHEVYDbubYD49SGA Urbana This University of Illinois campus fixture has the best Sicilian pizza due to the crust cheese sauce sausage not to short change any of the other additional ingredients pepperoni mushrooms etc or the thin pizza or the cheese garlic bread or the OK I m a fan since the late 70s oh am I showing my age A proof point is that while driving Columbus OH to Chicago I went through Champaign just to pick up a pie to go 4 stars versus 5 is due to the ongoing problem of table management during rush periods where tables will be empty between seatings while there is a line of people waiting out the door around the corner That being said once seated service has been consistently good through the generations of waitstaff that we have had And other than football weekends seating has not been a problem The bar is fairly well stocked Oh this last round I had bacon and it was 1 4 strips on the pie FANTASTIC 
2EjErj3ZIUdYDMGQvmtVRw Urbana I go here nearly every day There is often a line but it generally moves pretty fast I feel that the prices are pretty high for a college campus or even for a coffee shop in general They have a nice variety of muffins scones and sweet treats but I d like to see some that are a little less sweet and smaller in portion The staff are all very friendly 
2eN5IuegTj6V0fyxT9xTDg Urbana Update Had Zyggyz again and I liked it more The beef curry was good chicken tikka masala was a big sweet for me but ok 
2EyB1R5zPUa-HE2OY2AvZg Urbana To be blunt I m baffled at the amount of love the burgers here received on Yelp Really just not that good The meat was dry and overcooked the toppings were boring and it was pretty small The only reason this place received 3 stars from me was the OUTSTANDING soup The roasted corn and poblano chowder was absolutely delicious I wanted to stop by the nearest U of I frat house and borrow a beer bong to take down a vat of this soup yea it was that good Overall the Courier Cafe just feels kind of old kind of like the burgers taste but do yourself a favor and order a giant bowl of that soup 
2eYJwlGz5r6wDUxAd_KXfA Urbana Many of their dishes are still average but I branched out and had their grilled mackerel on my last visit Oh My God It was DELICIOUS So apparently if you order things on the menu that most Americans wouldn t the food is awesome 
2EzzJsXRVG_GqHlOFnSntQ Urbana Organic produce meats and herbs Arts and crafts Local community clubs Local music Two food trucks 
2F5J51OYtD49eyIUKJKVgg Urbana Love their pizza They used to have a great takeout special on Monday s not sure if they are still doing it Something like 6 for a large 
2FaZUGxRNHLFGyDUSXKVqw Urbana One of the two main international foods stores in town not counting Asian markets They have not only groceries but also a deli counter with many imported cheeses and olives They also have some fresh ready to eat items like salads samosas and baklava They re pretty similar to the other international food store I usually just visit whichever one is least out of my way This is the smaller of the two with overall a slightly smaller selection However I have noticed that EuroMart has a better selection of Turkish Greek and Bulgarian cheeses 
2gM35Z6iQ1uv_l1ar7bS2A Urbana I need to show Iron Post more love First off I didn t know that they served food Score Second the bartenders are usually quite friendly and that patio is the best on a hot summer night So Iron Post you have gone up in my heart And I really enjoyed that the fries for some reason kinda tasted like hamburger I dont know how that happened but I loved it Dont judge me 
2gn97nC2eksQXUJy2dkryg Urbana It is a small crowded place serving inexpensive and ok food But I think it is over rated in yelp 
2GtfvFsEwyq-Ef6yp5HXKA Urbana The absolute best Italian sandwich I ve ever had anywhere especially when on wheat bread Seriously order the Italian it s so good I rarely try anything else And it s dirt cheap 4 a normal sub 
2gWJqidEH2f1NmdRew5HBA Urbana This is the worst chinese food I have ever had in my entire life I ordered the sesame chicken combo which came with fried rice egg drop soup and an egg roll The egg roll was fine the egg drop soup was slimy and so thick it seemed like a gravy not a soup The fried rice was your standard rice but the CHICKEN was where I was DISGUSTED It was all fat and gristle cooked beyond the point of recognition and there was hardly any white or dark meat to speak of I ate all of the rice and egg roll one sip of the soup and one piece of chicken A total waste of money I also doubt they could pass any health code inspections because this chicken was NOT chicken 
2h1BHzhitC9ktYXcTfNqfA Urbana Beer flights and food were amazing here We had a very cool server and the atmosphere makes you want to stay and drink several beer flights Best BBQ in Chambana 
2HGu1BNOBIs_WDYX8AbvWQ Urbana This rating is not for the store since I have never gone inside I am a heavy donator to the Salvation Army I take donations at least twice a month The person at this location who comes out to the car to take the donations is not friendly at ALL I have been really nice and thanked him several times but I have not once heard him utter a peep back or look at me He scowls and acts like he hates being there It is so bad that I won t take my donations there anymore Instead I will drive all the way across town to take them to the one on Market Street or I try to find one of those little boxes on the corner come to think of it those little boxes are a heck of lot friendlier than that person at the Salvation Army s donation door 
2hVRmaARCryLLmFDf40ivA Urbana Went there for a sandwich at noon Only 2 other tables were occupied I was with 2 other people Took 1 hour to get our food My sandwich was burnt Waitress was apologetic Made me a new one in 15 minutes Skimped on the meat it was mostly just bread Thought they were having an off day but apparently every day is an off day after reading these reviews I hear it s fun at night but I d skip going there for meals 
2iGoOl48fn6u0704ntJw1w Urbana If you re looking for something a bit more upscale than Za s on campus and Biaggi s is out of your price range Manzella s is the place to go The portions are big but are slightly pricey They have a small menu but their speciality is a make your own past dish They also have a handful of baked pastas which I found to be good as well 
2iYt7Kaet1PXtX2_7WqyaQ Urbana Great selection of shoes that are actually good for your feet although you might have a alter your wardrobe a bit Brands like Birkenstock and I bevieve New Balance They do a good job measuring for a custom fit I m sorry that the chunky heels went out of style but it s probably a boon for a business like this If you re feet ain t happy neither are you 
2j0VxAdZpVPgOJXDZyxw7A Urbana An incredible place palace would be no typo here for all ages and purposes whether it s studying or leisure browsing The checkout procedure has achieved the holy grail of modernity technologically advanced easy to use extremely efficient and extremely cool Out of town visitors and other first time patrons will be very impressed no matter how geeky they may be 
2Ja-f64hX-wFjiWQVnv9CQ Urbana I like it enough to come back The grilled Hawaiian sandwich is good but crispy borderline burnt tasting today Their tuna salad is really yummy They are pretty skimpy on salad dressings and a few times I ve had some wilty yuckiness in my field greens salad Nice ambience though and good outdoor seating 
2JaLO1kxLYuDE9t0_SOQFQ Urbana Small but good Wish I lived closer I would go there alot more 
2ji2h2cUDhZzTyAhXaDqKA Urbana We haven t been to Silvercreek in years we were disappointed with the food Rumor spread that they got a new manager We decided to give them another try The Chef s Line Burger is best burger in town no exageration Even my wife thinks so and she does not like to eat burgers Tonight we enjoyed the appetizer buffet with oysters chicken shrimp salads artichoke dip fresh fruit and chef cooked steak on the grill delicious You must try the Peach Kuchen to finish your meal Silvercreek is now our local favorite If you haven t been lately you must give them a try 
2JrfSxLh4NArxqhW5ZgxFA Urbana After a fun filled fish fry rehearsal dinner friends and I gathered here for a night cap or two or three It was mentioned to us by the beautiful bride to be to try this place Wonderful high ceilings comfy curled couches interesting bar seats cute bar staff well okay the girls behind the bar and a very mixed crowd But what were we here for Well myself and the rest of the crowd wanted a beer my friend wanted some girls he could hit on I won Were there girls he could hit on here Yes so don t get me wrong on that account but not the skanky girls he was interested in We sat at the bar I poured over their menu rather impressive About 8 to 10 different dirty martinis as well as a multitude of drinks and wines Plenty of imported and micro brews abound Food looked pretty good as well but my stomach was full from munching earlier but on the other hand if it wasn t I would have chowed down I do have to say the staff behind the bar was hustling their butts off so I allow the waiting a bit to get some attention to slide Yet I didn t understand why the bartenders were also serving tables as well perhaps some one called in sick Yet they were still friendly and even made sure my friend s martini was just right when he said it was too dirty for him Even a DJ was spinning some tracks I do have a weird feeling that this place is trying to do too much perhaps with the competition of bars in the area they are trying to serve an everything under the sun atmosphere in a more upscale college town I really liked it and if I ever find myself in town again I want to stop by here However I need to find a driver for this town to whisk me away back to my hotel Finding a cab is harder than finding a Michigan Wolverine fan here 
2JvmN5rziE-Wce7VdAWYFA Urbana I don t think I share the opinion of the other reviewers It looks okay but not super trendy This place is a ripoff and the food is just not that good The teppan is okay but they dump a bunch of sweet and sour sauce on everything The lunch buffet is not that good The Korean dishes are okay but I think I would rather go to B Won The sushi is okay but really expensive and not that good I would rather go here than Ko Fusion but that s not saying much 
2k3g4etjFKXw6iynaXG8Nw Urbana Jupiter s Pizza is awesome A place where you can swap your favorite pizza toppings with friends enjoy your go to beer on the side chat with friends and watch the basketball game on their large TVs They also have pool tables and arcade games My favorite night to go is Tuesday because they have half off large pizzas and it s a popular night to go Warning to Chicago native deep dish lovers these pizzas are thin crust pizzas and I m from St Louis so we love thin crust pizzas but this place does not rip you off on toppings Jupiter s specialty pizzas are great There s no need to stress about perfecting your pizzas toppings since they already have specialty pizzas with your already favorite toppings If you want to make your own crazy masterpiece you can customize your pizza with four toppings maximum meat toppings count as two More importantly the price is very reasonable Also this place has a clean friendly fun atmosphere It s definitely one of my favorite places to go in downtown champaign I recommend every U of I student to check this place out with friends there before graduation 
2KVZMURKlYSyi2ueugc-0A Urbana I always enjoy the chipolte steak soft tacos and the black beans 
2KzMQuqa_tvIp8FvcAffgw Urbana Unfortunately this gem of a store is closing However everything is now 50 off which is amazing They have truly beautiful pieces of classic furniture and accessories Seriously I ve been schooling myself on interior design for the past month i e obsessively reading the blogs of top designers and when I walked in here last weekend I was in HEAVEN 
2L66rRbRg-AQHdKybwBVCA Urbana Honeydew bubble tea freeze Amazing 
2lLxkoZYQzFhVGIGhr5wjA Urbana I was extremely disappointed by Bevier cafe during the 2012 summer On many occasions the food was inconsistently portioned or prepared For example the country fried steak on several occasions was extremely greasy with oil oozing off of batter a clear sign that it was not cooked at a high enough temperature When broccoli and beef over rice was offered take out orders simply were not portioned with enough food For a dish over 5 there should be more than two pieces of beef Items billed as hot sandwiches arrived cold with cheese not even partially melted As this is a student run enterprise let s hope that the Fall batch of students are more detail oriented and the quality improves 
2lMD_y223j2y1NCil6o4uA Urbana Nice atmosphere but not so nice hot chocolate I can be a food drink purist sometimes and I didn t like them using chocolate sauce for my drink Eww 
2lVX5sY1vULXn_z4DZht9Q Urbana After seeing Jenna Sarah and Melissa all give Kam s one star I realized they are the most intelligent people reviewing Kam s and I had to follow in their footsteps They re right Kam s blows It deserves ZERO stars You know how you can pin point freshman when they come to the UIUC Bingo They re toting around bright orange Illini Union Bookstore bags Same goes to the people who wait in line at Kam s The majority are freshman Underage drinkers who can t hold their liquor Screw that Some drunk guy peed on my foot here True story I was only eighteen and not proud to be in the bar You can find cheap drinks with attractive and coherent people almost anywhere else in Champaign Urbana LOOK
