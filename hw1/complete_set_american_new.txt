-4O_tHmRmFfFs_aFalRBpw CMU Not great Stale bread and the food was strongly over flavored I had a glass of wine and was asked if I wanted another and I said just a half glass which I ask for all the time and get The reply from the waitress was we can t do that and the same from the manager CAN T do that Terrible attitude more like WON T do that Well I WON T be going back 
-6DLz1IRdz5zpNRuC9DMNQ CMU I visited the 1947 Tavern on a Saturday night with five others We luckily had a reservation as the small space was pretty packed at 6 30 Our server gave us a run down of the specials and we proceeded to order drinks There were no bourbon drinkers at the table but my lady got a whiskey sour and later a shady cider both of which she enjoyed The first course of the table consisted of bruchette cheese plate mac n cheese and a cup of the soup du jour beef vegetable The bruchette had duck confit on it great flavor but the crostinis were a little soggy The peanut sauce was well liked by the table but the fruit jam was out of place and bland on the cheese plate I quite enjoyed the aged goat cheese as well as the pate The mac n cheese was just pretty eh It was served in a casserole dish covered by a parm crisp It lacked flavor and moisture and although i ate the entire cheese crisp it seemed odd I m not sure if it was intended to be eaten with the macaroni since it pulled off as one large chewy crispy sheet of baked cheese I was told the cup of beef vegetable was very good The entrees consisted of lamb burgers the fish special lamb pasta chicken and I got the lamb loins Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees and left full We all cleared our plates with the exception of the lamb pasta which was definitely the largest portion at the table Some notes on the main course My lady was not a fan of the buns used on the lamb burger The dish itself is two slider sized burgers on what looks like large dinner rolls The buns texture though reminded me of stale biscuit The fries and demi sauce were both tasty though as well as burger patties that came out as requested medium My lamb on the other hand came out about a doneness too far luckily I ordered it MR so they were still good The meat was about four chops worth of meat served off the bone The dish looked a little messy and lackluster because of this but I enjoyed the lamb roasted tomatoes polenta and sauce on my plate My sister got a MW steak which was cooked perfectly She really enjoyed it but said her scalloped potatoes weren t very warm and had an odd flavor After tasting them I believe they used a goat cheese in the potatoes for a bit of tang The steal of the night was the fish special which was a pan seared Hawaiian Escolar for 15 It looked good and the plate was cleaned pretty quickly In conclusion I should mention the staff did well Our server was a young lady that offered to answer any questions and checked on our meals promptly after they were served She refilled waters fast even though the restaurant leaves a carafe of water on the table for the guests She also brought out a plate of toasted crostini when asked for something to pick at our peanut sauce with while waiting for the main course which wasn t a long wait Sadly the tavern does not offer bread service All said and done it was pretty ok With myself not living in the city I can t say I will make my way back here anytime soon but I wouldn t be opposed to trying more of the menu sometime 
-77Mt73ipevSGb1u3CdFHw CMU When my friends wanted to meet up at 1947 I groaned because my experience there last winter was NOT good see original review However when my PIC Partner In Cuisine and I arrived last night we were pleasantly surprised to see that 1947 had a pretty nice back deck for warm summer outdoor seating Ok I thought Maybe at least we ll have some nice atmosphere When I picked up the menu I realized it was completely different The options were actually pretty decent looking and the prices were WAY better than I remembered especially the beer prices I ordered the fried chicken salad and I got a deliciously fried chicken breast on a bed of greens with a 1 2 of avocado It was pretty darn good The downside this time was the service The restaurant wasn t really that full certainly not at capacity yet it took almost 10 minutes to get a beer from one of the hipster wannabe waiters Sometimes it s good that even if you have a negative experience at a restaurant to go back and give it another go after a while I m glad the management made the menu and price improvements because my second experience there was leaps and bounds above my first They will definitely be given more opportunities to earn more stars from me if they keep it up Original Review Not a fan Our party spent more time and money at the this place than we should have The service was good but otherwise the food tasted like something my elderly grandma with no sense of tasted put together and the drinks were way way way too expensive With all the quality places to spend a Saturday night in Shadyside 1947 doesn t even rank 
-9jXE9VxESK4l8rYcgvaUg CMU Lots of pizzas and salads on the menu a decent looking wine list and some nice beers on tap including one offering from East End Brewing Company Big Hop There are some nice tables available outside on the porch and plenty of indoor seating and a bar The service was somewhat lacking they didn t even bring me silverware and the server seemed to run away when I tried to ask for a napkin I tried the asparagus pizza and crab salad sandwich Both were decent although not incredible and the pizza was definitely on the salty side I ll probably be back although I wasn t overjoyed with what I had 
-bcreRgXhbkyfe4fEHHCRw CMU So after my 2 stars everyone was horrified How did you not like it How did you give them 2 stars So we decided to go to back and give it another try We started with 2 drinks a glass of Riesling which was one of the best glasses of Riesling I have ever had ever I went on a wine tour of the finger lakes a few eyars ago and had almost nothing but rieslings and this was better J had the Sunny Day or something like that with tequila Definitely not good It was supposed to have a citrus flavor with it but it really just tasted like a cup of tequila Good tequila but not a god drink We started with the lamb riblets Amazing Excellent lamb flavor and a delicious rhubarb chutney I would have preferred more bite with the chutney but the lamb was really amazing I then had the salmon which came with turnips and swiss chard with a red wine reduction and a lemon sauce Nothing really blew me out of the water here except the lemon sauce It was perfect The salmon was cooked perfectly but what was lacking was the seasoning I think everything would have been perked up a bit with a little more seasoning J had the lobster ravioli which was the best thing ever I really think the ravioli was stuffed with an entire lobster the sauce I have no idea what the sauce was but it was delicious This was really really good I cannot go on enough about how really fantastic this was We also got the tallow fries with mayo They were delicious but probably not worth the heart clogging calories from using the tallow All in all this was a delicious meal and I am very happy that we went back for a second try 
-bDydurT_OQAlEsOmvoxLA CMU Took a couple of friends there recently It was a weekend afternoon so we didn t face what I hear is the usual crush of people PROs One of my friends was visiting from Italy and tells me that the pizza at The Porch is the closest he s had to northern Italian pizza EVER in the US I guess that s a good thing if you re looking for authentic Italian pizza I enjoyed the pizza thin crispy crust and NOT overloaded with toppings The sandwich and salad I had was fresh and crisp The service was okay friendly and prompt but the server did disappear and not check back after we had our entrees CONs Out of several menu items on both visits but that could be cost of serving fresh food I ll be back It s good to have a comfortable place like The Porch so close by 
-CEOGs3GAUdk_bUqmy5XUQ CMU Went back for a late night dessert and drinks It was busy and bustling for a Friday Night in Oakland The warm bread pudding was delicious Their alcoholic twist on an Arnold Palmer was great I applaud anyone who makes their own limoncello Sitting at the bar is fun on the kitchen side because you get to see all the action and feel the warm glow of their oven Servers are still very friendly of course I really got a kick out of seeing menus cut up and recycled as bar coasters Be warned though their bar only had the ingredients to make the cocktails on their menu Full bar isn t quite accurate It s probably due to space but I hope this changes I look forward to a nice gin cocktail on the outside porch on a hot day Small update went back for brunch again had the biscuits and gravy and a seasonal soda The soda was apple ginger and AMAZING I say again AMAZING The biscuits and gravy was too much food and made me feel like a glutton but that s my own dietary mistake I could only eat 3 out of the 4 homemade biscuits before giving up 
-DnZVGWCfysnZFSnJF3gsA CMU so far so good trendy AND tasty I have learned from some more experienced Yelp ers to always visit a restaurant at least twice before the final Yelp But I just went to legume a brand new restaurant in Regent Square and couldn t wait to Yelp about it Legume feels like it should be in San Francisco the unassuming brick front hides a light and bright interior Tin ceiling school house lighting botanical prints antique mismatched furniture a great ambiance I would live inside this place seriously They don t try to get away with just looking pretty this sadly often happens with new restaurants in pgh The food was quite good as well I had a vegetarian stew perfect portion size tasty and fresh along with the watermelon gazpacho which was spicy and refreshing Don t be fooled by the name either They have meat dishes too two types of steak on the menu when I visited Supposedly the menu changes all the time which is also reassuring Definitely worth trying and if you don t like it you can always cross the street to Dee s and get some hotdogs afterwards 
-Fn581LmjquGcguvSrH8mw CMU Chicken under a freaking skillet I tear up just thinking about it I almost never order chicken at a fine dining restaurant but heard rave reviews from a chef friend and had to try All of the other entrees simply disappear on the page now when I am at legume I dream about this chicken It is so simple and so perfectly executed The rest of the menu is very good as well I have had excellent pates and mousses and many other great mains fish and steak The only dishes I have been under impressed by are the soups which I have generally found bland The ambience in the dining room could be improved a bit It is just a little too sterile The bar on the other hand is an excellent space Overall an excellent restaurant 
-YcvdC9vdVLPwd0eH1MvuQ CMU I had the opportunity to eat at Toast again this year and I can say that it was even better than before The menu was great and the Black Drum which I had never heard of before was excellent I highly recommend eating at Toast if you are in Pittsburgh and looking for somewhere to exceed your expectations 
0-wEqR7HaV7j7Bff0k2AFA CMU First off I loved the atmosphere and layout of this restaurant so much that I knew I would be coming back again and again I ordered pretty boring things so I don t feel it s fair for me to rate the food entirely I did try my friend s dishes and really enjoyed the duck as well as the roast beef sandwich I was also a big fan of their crispy taters I ll definitely be back again 
030otpgEln8EftKbFTjYZg CMU We went to Legume on Saturday for dinner The restaurant is small but friendly atmosphere We had the pre fix four course dinner The menu changes periodically but the flavor remains consistent and wonderful For appetizers we had turnip soup and sate mushrooms Entrees we picked duck and salmon Lastly panna cotta for desert Everything was delicious The service was excellent We definitely return to try out new menus and recommend this place anytime 
05vkUnLZ1ZC4IVoVF9ys6Q CMU Houghs flies under the radar in the Pittsburgh beer scene Thankfully so as I really didnt want to wade through crowds of pretentious yuppies in the Sharp Edge They have a fantastic draft and bottle selection A great redeeming quality is the ability to get sampler flights which is awesome for trying new beers They have a plethora of televisions for sports viewing as well as large and small tables for either a personal setting or communal setting I cannot comment on the food but given what I have witness thus far I will return Stay thirsty my friends 
05VmdOADSoRmG3567ewNQg CMU I found the food to be good but a bit overpriced I liked that they were BYOB The atmosphere was fine but nothing amazing 
0b4ZD1OXUJ1AR7Daho6NTA CMU I just went to UP and couldn t wait to write this review Based on the previous reviews I thought this restaurant would be great however it was NOT This is by far the worst meal I have had in a very long time Let s start with the drinks I had a cinnamon sangria which was watered down and tasted awful I didn t even drink it I had the waitress return it for something else and she still put it on my bill Have they ever heard of customer service where I m from when I return a drink I don t expect it on my bill I then tried the Peach Bellini I am not sure who the bartender is but the last time I checked Prosecco should be served chilled I received an extremely warm drink We also ordered a white wine which was shockingly also served warm This place should really invest in a wine cooler or an ice bucket either one would solve this problem Now to the food We ordered off the small plates the sea scallops and the grilled wild texas shrimp I can sum up the taste of both of these meals simply SALT overload All I could taste on both of these meals was seasoning and not good seasoning It was absolutely disgusting For our main course we ordered the jambalaya The rice although spicy was drowning in a pool of water which washed off any flavor in it Like the sea scallops and shrimp from my previous meal this was also extremely salty I wish I could give this place zero stars but unfortunately I m forced to give it one As on overpriced restaurant the food was horrendous and the drinks were even worse P S I have lived in Manhattan my entire life and recently moved to Pittsburgh this restaurant is nothing near what meal in New York would consist of I am not sure where all these great reviews came from 
0bRBAT2PZZAR4LIO5diBMg CMU It was probably a nice restaurant twenty some years ago the locale is a converted pretty Victorian with stain glass windows the bar area displays a disused grand piano propping up bottles of wine the dining room still sports a pastel palette of sea foam and salmon and framed 80 s posters of the same color scheme grace the walls The menu is marginally more updated than the decor Some dishes remind me of food fads from the 90 s e g the chef seems to have a penchant for meat and fruit pairing Overall the menu is too long and rambling without a theme covering everything from the Baja to the Mediterranean The food was unremarkable The bread tasted like a generic supermarket baguette it was served with olive oil and powdery parm i e from the green can For appetizers we ordered the prosciutto and figs as well as the trout and peaches They were probably the highlight of the meal but the portions were tiny and the ingredients were not the best For the main course I tried their fish taco which was on the bland and dry side Summary if you are ever nostalgic for fine dining in a small American town during the 80 s this place is for you 
0ckme5ZCkmidTGUUdFdNyw CMU Good if not great place to get a meal at Mom and I were having a girls day out and we decided to stop in here for brunch before heading over to the Phipps The chicken n waffles organic fried chicken in gravy plus waffles caught my eye as did the eggs benedict But I was in the mood for some sweetness The cinnamon swirl French Toast with sausage links was pretty good Mmmm French Toast Pump that insulin Susan Pump Whoo hoo The cinnamon did give it a nice bite too Good thing Rick and I hit the bike trails the day beore Mom went for the roasted tomato and bacon frittata which looked good too Many of the negative comments here seem to be about the prices The dinner prices look high for what you get but the brunch prices run about 8 00 10 00 per entree Service here is good though 
0fj8HzJDOej5AcnNhN9AGA CMU I don t think it gets any better than this place In town celebrating a couple of birthdays we started our night at Toast and quickly found out why everyone we talked to described the place as fabulous While I can t say we had the most enthusiastic bar service while we waited for our table the bartender didn t seem to like that we asked him to take our picture so perhaps it was our fault since he was so busy things quickly took a turn for the best when we settled into our cozy booth and were given a tour of the menu by our knowledgeable and attentive server Between the 3 of us we sampled the Ahi Tuna uh maze ing the filet the arctic char and the flounder The wine list was well rounded uninhibited sophisticated and provided very reasonably priced and tasty selections After our meal our server offered to call us a cab so we could continue our celebrating but soon brought the sad news that it would take hours for one to get to us thanks to a Mr Bon Jovi and his concert His alternative suggestion The owner of the bar would drop us off on Ellsworth since he was going to go past it anyway Really When does that type of thing happen I wish I could give this place 10 stars but I ll have to settle with 5 Keep this place in mind when an occasion pops up and a great restaurant is needed You ll want to be here for it 
0luhcwW9NEjxcqMWMAgm5w CMU Do they have the best service no Is their food that great uhm it s ok I ve had a good Reuben sandwich I ve had ok pasta but is their French Strawberry pie with a thin layer of chocolate in the crust worth a pilgrimage that required me driving an hour one direction to get it in season YES it is that good Their carrot cake is also stupendous The raspberry chambord thing is my mother s favorite If they ever have lemon cheesecake when you re there it s phenomenal Dont expect to be dazzled by the menu or the service but getting French Strawberry pie in May is worth going to Gullifty s Honest it s worth it 
0mpgIfPs3OQli0hPYWhYeQ CMU Awesome place with some very unique dishes Everything is good but you gotta get the shrimp and grits for an appetizer 
0ObZrgF9xWDxor4UP0iQ2g CMU Of all the neighborhood bars I ve had living in seven different locations in Pittsburgh over the past 12 years Hough s is by far my favorite Here s why it s awesome 1 Excellent beer selection I admit it I m a bit of a beer novice I stick to what I know lagers pilsners and the occasional brown ale However for real beer lovers this is a great place I believe they have something in the range of 50 60 beers on TAP at any given time Not to mention the bottle selection Growlers to go if you re interested 2 WANGZ Wednesday is wing night It s packed Why Because these wings are big juicy freshly made you ll wait 10 15 min per order warning clearly stated on the menu and the sauces dry dubs are A MAH ZING that s for you MH 3 Buttered toasted buns on all the sandwiches burgers May seem like a trivial thing but I tell you when you chomp into a Chicken Cheese Steak and you get a burst of buttery toasted goodness you ll know what I m talkin bout One downside which I won t even factor into my overall rating is that they are closed on Sunday s except Steeler Sundays of course they aren t uncivilized I feel like Hough s could really corner the Sunday afternoon breezy beer drinking occasion Eh I guess bartenders can have days off too PS The chili also rocks Try it on their house made chips PPS This review makes me want to run a few miles and eat a salad 
0r6mmARKN2_duxeGfumjUQ CMU Murray Ave Grill is essentially the only American restaurant in Sq Hill so they ve got you cornered if you just want a steak or salad The space isn t bad but they play 50 s music which just doesn t go with anything in there The service is usually nice and attentive They ve got a decent beer selection and the drinks flow until 2am When the weather s nice there s outdoor seating and they also have Sunday brunch 
0RFOneh7DBVilFoHl0nFvw CMU The only reason that I am giving this restaurant 2 stars is for the atmosphere location and idea This is one of those places that survive solely on sight The restaurant itself is very nice and located right next to the park I love love love the porch theme and atmosphere except it can be noisy Now the food on the other has a lot to be desired Eat n Park needs to evaluate what type of food that the offerings should be here They can not continue to venture into other types of dining while continuing to do the same old foods Just because it has a fancy name is isn t fancy I had the Grilled Farm Bread Sandwich Fried Egg house cured pork belly Vermont Cheddar Crispy Taters this basically equated to a bacon scrambler with over easy eggs cheddar cheese on Italian Bread which is something like 6 99 at eat n park compared to 9 00 here That is not upscale a nice plate with a nicer atmosphere has to have better food My wife had the RUSTIC BREAD SALAD Grilled Sourdough Bread Cherry Tomatoes Fresh Mozzarella Fris e Radicchio Housemade Coppa Basil Pesto the bread was burnt leaving an aftertaste and the basil pesto sauce was awful For 11 00 I expect a lot more Eat n Park got the decor location and atmosphere correct but they need to think outside the box when it comes to the food We really wanted to like this place 
10WN186BwrSHW3kqyiUmpw CMU If you re a college student in Pittsburgh odds are at some point or another you ve been here for dessert I will say on a college budget you get a lot of good reasonably priced food here Can it compete with the best of NYC no of course not but that isn t where you are is it Get a reuben and chase it down with a piece of cheesecake Go home happy Quit whining about how Pittsburgh isn t NYC 
181oX3k6Og2LLgLCxwhG6Q CMU I went to Legume for the first time a few weeks ago The atmosphere service and food were excellent We made a reservation for a Friday night The food is very fresh local and best of all delicious When eating the first bites of my food I paused to enjoy all of the flavors Also bring a bottle of your favorite wine 
195SH5gu1mxXJXnRRhs0uA CMU I don t think I would ever go back here It was quite overpriced and the food was strikingly bland Also if you re a caucasian chef don t try to serve Asian dishes unless you have a clue It s effing embarrassing My risotto was ZzZzZzZzzzzzzzzzzzzz How hard is it to make good risotto ya dummy 
19TAsvgGboX_c_ZsxnxAmQ CMU i asked the chef to create something vegetarian since I didn t see alot of items on the menu It was fantastic Jalapeno risotto with greens and some other items I was very impressed and will return Upscale but relaxed loved it 
1A0qYIIXOOHmc5dTMXl4_w CMU After previous bad experiences at Red Oak I d stopped going there for a few months Today I decided to give them a second try hoping maybe the staff had changed over enough for them to have improved Boy was I wrong I ordered 2 salads both of which came with old lettuce a few pieces of romaine were red throughout the stem and mine had a few rotten tomatoes one was black for half of it The final straw While eating his Ceasar salad my friend cut his mouth on a sharp hard piece of plastic I called before walking back to the store and the guy on the phone said they would be willing to make things better When I got back to the restaurant the manager walked up pulled 7 out of the drawer threw it at me and said have a good day without even asking me what was actually wrong or trying to see what the problem was My question to Red Oak after reading all the bad reviews here How do you expect to make things better if you won t even listen to what is wrong 
1AE3wCdGQ_xdWDB5m0aSqg CMU We went to The Porch recently for Sunday brunch Love the bright and open space We got a table towards in back along the banquet We were greeted right away by our super perky server For drinks BJ opted for a seasonal beer and I ordered a pineapple sage margarita I love this drink so good BJ ordered the chorizo eggs He thought it was okay But he really liked the fried potatoes I loved his meal I sampled I got the Rocket salad I loved the roasted beet and the Sherry vinaigrette I thought the chorizo was a little tough We decided to get the cookies for a sweet little treat We were told we would get 6 and we even got to pick what kind 3 peanut butter cookies and 3 white chocolate macadamia nut cranberry Somehow we only ended up with 5 We were missing one cookie We asked our server about our missing cookie and she couldn t come up with a satisfactory answer Kinda of a strange ending to an otherwise good meal 
1cVwx9qVxwscPGkPWeHzTg CMU Everyone raves about the desserts here but I m not sure what the big deal is I was kind of grossed out by the food and the desserts were so so tasted like the fridge sad to say I cannot recommend Perhaps quality has declined over the years On the plus side there are giant photographs of vegetables on the walls 
1gkBP-c7F7u8MmUEU_KwEg CMU Nice place attentive staff and good attention to detail in the kitchen We asked for a tasting menu with wine pairings and gave them no other guidance The meal they prepared was very appropriate in both the succession of flavors and the portion sizes Everything was very well prepared The wines were all very nice but the pairings could have been better It seemed like the person who was preparing the food menu and the person who prepared the wine listing didn t actually talk to each other I could have lived without the series of employees who came by to socialize with the couple at the table next to ours for most of the meal Having to look at someone s ass for an entire course at a time really takes away from the ambiance of a place Overall we were pleased by the meal and will go back sometime 
1gpBFsH9V4O_xiRCDFtTNQ CMU If it weren t for two friends who absolutely love Gullifty s and swear by their desert I would have only tried Gullifty s once It s not because Gullifty s is bad the desert is fine but I don t think it warrants the title of Best Desert in Pittsburgh Gullifty s is like an independent Eat N Park Portions are plentiful the atmosphere is comfortable and the food is average If that s what your e looking for this is the place to go 
1jTYX5EVJS9YtO_bOPEong CMU This is a solid contemporary neighborhood bistro I liked Avenue B for its frequently changing menu with up to date dishes that appeal to current palates fresh ingredients competent kitchen overall the food is pretty good competent front staff friendly hostess helpful wait staff comfortable ambiance pricing comparing to other restaurants of its type not too expensive Why it s not a 5 star While the kitchen does have the basics down they won t overcook the meat for example not every component of every dish works I do appreciate that they are at least trying to put together interesting flavors but sometimes the combination is just off Of what I ve sampled there I d rate the dishes in the B range they are far from a disaster but none was a hit out of the park winner Recently a friend walked into Salt of the Earth and confused it with Avenue B because of the oversized chalkboards I thought the two restaurants make an interesting comparison I d give the food nod to Salt but I probably would visit AveB more frequently because it is a more comfortable dining experience overall 
1OICyYQWc0WBPDQ39Jrjyw CMU It s an entire enterprise centered on salads customized and created right in front of you And that s enough alliteration for one review The value proposition is VERY simple If you want a salad and you want to have a lot of control over what goes into it chosen from a variety of options then go here If you want anything else in the world don t go here they have other menu items but nothing that can t be beat elsewhere I will give a special mention of their beverage selection Pretty good unsweetened iced tea sits next to a fountain with multiple Boylan brand whoops sodas Better than your normal soft drink offerings Oh and because you have to basically go down the counter with someone as he or she makes your salad I think it would be a hard place to go with groups since there will be substantial lag in between the times the first and last people receive their salads though it s not as big a problem as it would be at other restaurants since you don t have to worry about your salad getting cold 
1qR6mwoWM8jmghBa3smysA CMU The chef really makes some challenging dishes The dishes incorporated seasonal local produce we had ramps All the menu choices are posted on the giant chalkboard and you get choices of sides The restuarant is small and seating area is very tight but acceptable If you are looking for a contemporary menu that incorporates all many types of cuisine look no further and bring a bottle of vino 
1WMzRZSTLCZdkmr0eibMPA CMU I m seriously confused at why people hate on this place so much Maybe the service food can be iffy at times but today it was great I hadn t been here in a really long time so I felt like I had to try the food again to write a proper review We got the best seat in the house according to the host That actually means the seat by the window so you can people watch Everything looks good on the menu so I opted for a little bit of everything I started with the cauliflower soup I didn t know what to expect but it came as pureed with a cheesy taste to it It was amazing I asked the server what was in it and she said it was cream cheese Mystery solved cream cheese makes everything better I also tried the beat salad I loved the fact that there was golden and red beets in it I just wish there were more although I always feel that way about beet salads at restaurants it seems The main course was the Walnut Crusted Salmon with Bread Pudding and Apple Buerre Blanc It was really tasty The salmon was cooked perfectly which meant not over cooked at all and the bread pudding apple buerre was really delish Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive and I really couldn t ask for a better meal I ve been won over and I d definitely go back and try ten things again 
1YG4-mEbU2PBL-Xca6Xf8Q CMU I was looking for a casual ish place to entertain business partners The parameters decent bar options food for picky eaters dieters as well as the slightly adventurous and not about the break the bank I walked away from a fairly decadent meal for about 30 a head including tip and tax Not bad Not bad at all Location great neighborhood for those who know it right by Pitt CMU and the Carnegie institute Street parking can be a bit of a pain And don t try finding the restaurant on your GPS it s technically in a park but it s visible from Forbes Street If you re doing an event here for folks out of town be sure to give good directions about travel and parking Appetizers I ordered plates of meat and vegetarian antipasti for the table with two cornbread skillets The food was appropriate for our table and there were small plates already out but why no serving utensils Also the cornbread skillet is somewhat awkwardly sized it s way too big buttery and dense for one person too large to be romantic for two probably more appropriate for four people to share but it feels small I don t know I would almost prefer it if they did single serve cornbread pieces that were a third the size of the cornbread dishes Entrees I was quite pleased with my scallops well seasoned kind of unexpected combination with roasted pumpkins I believe and my table mates seemed pleased with their pizza nice presentation on the pizza and their hamburgers and veggie burger Atmosphere mostly a young adult crowd kind of felt like a fresh twist on a diner Modern decor I found fitting great park views but the MUSIC Top 40 s dreck playing a bit too loudly for my taste If I m back in the area I ll definitely consider doing another meal here but as far as I m concerned this is not a place I ll go out of my way to visit again 
1Z-mLi9s_fnpwCjLPe4Eew CMU It was a warm early summer night and Annie surprised me with reservations for this charming little bistro that I have been meaning to visit since it s opening but for whatever reason just kept missing the opportunity However after chatting with the chef at the restaurant party I d renewed my urgency for visiting The restaurant is located on s braddock ave in regent square I used to spend more time here back when a friend lived near and its added a few good spots since D s six pags and dogz for example but I ll save that review for another time This is a nice area for date night with a few places for casual fine dining independant flick at Regent square theater or shopping then pool and guiness at one of the local irish pubs Legume offers outdoor dining which is great especially when their is good people watching like there is here We weren t able to sit outside but got a fine table in the intimate and dimly lit dining room It is a small place and unfortunately we were seated a little too close to some guy going on and on about hedge funds so it was a little too close for comfort I think there is like 8 or 10 tables mostly 4 tops The floors are hardwood and I like some of the details of the space itself such as the fixtures and art These folks also get the details as I noticed with the silverware they were using I think Toast uses the same type of simple ornate silverware A couple other non food details It s byob for a small corkage fee of 3 Many other spots charge 10 You can feel comfy in Jeans flip flops or a suit and I noticed all forms of attire and all ages These folks are totally ingredient driven and I m sure are into the whole farm to table movement and sustainability They change most of the menu daily and use top quality ingredients and often serve traditional fare with a contemporary flair Okay onto the food We started with some good quality crusty bread and delicious room temperature high quality butter Our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive I started with the tuna tartar It was a nice portion of sushi grade tuna with perhaps a citrus or some type of acid used to cut the richness of the fish It was okay I mean it didn t blow me away but was perfectly acceptable However I have to admit I ve had tuna tartare that seemed to have a more crisp or bright flavor if you will at other places Again it was fine just not 5 stars Annie tried the Buttermilk soup with bulger chickpeas and parsley Unfortunately Annie didn t know it was served cold and that would have been a non starter for her before go I tasted it and not really being a fan of cold soup it wasn t my thing either I get what he was going for I think It was rich while also not seeming to be too heavy It had a very layered flavor and I noticed many different spices most notably curry I had the steak for my entree and I think it was served with mashed potatoes It was cooked perfectly delicious and flavorful The mashed potatoes were also really good I don t think I want to know how much cream and butter is used For me the steak was the first thing I had that I really liked here Annie had their famous Chicken cooked under a skillet with garlic and mashed potatoes I really enjoyed this also and see why it is so popular The chicken was moist and I prefer this than to just boring chicken breast The skin was great and the mashed potatoes again were quite good We skipped dessert however I think next time we ll definitely try them One last thing the waitress noticed Annie didn t eat her soup and insisted on taking it off the bill This place is quite good and probably deserves 3 5 stars I hope to do a better job on my choices next time and update this review with another star 
2-30OJbNLopNQrODIJQb1A CMU Their food is good and they have plenty of healthy options including an option for a veggie as your side instead of their delicious chips I work in Oakland so it s a good place to stop by and get lunch from with reasonable prices I definitely couldn t afford to eat here every day of the week 
2bopRyI1clRa3UHxsBzaAQ CMU The best brunch in Pittsburgh After Doing brunch at about five other places this place really stands out The French toast was perfectly done with nutella and fruit The scramble was perfectly done as well with the right level of moisture and a hint but not overwhelming amount of goat cheese with a perfectly done potato pancake The dinner is pretty good too with a solid black bean burger and a memorable fish taco being on the offerings on that menu Prompt and attentive but not pushy wait staff round out this review One of my favorite restaurants in the burgh 
2g84hN-IL5Mni8X8Gi3epQ CMU Consistently tasty The waffles here are unlike any waffles I ve had before I have visited this place upwards of ten times in the past year and I enjoy the consistently tasty selection The ice cream is amazing and it s nice to have a fresh fruit option I highly recommend this place as a morning date though it may also be good as a late night snack Try the speculoos 
2G9JmzXj4jxArN_pJEuyng CMU This is the only restaurant in central Oakland that is both tasty and reasonably healthy Plus they make a big deal of using sustainably locally grown foods whenever possible I have to disagree with one of the reviewers disdain for the soup the spicy gumbo is pretty good though I always end up having to add extra hot sauce My personal favorite things about Red Oak include 1 Newly expanded hours 7 AM 9 PM so I can usually get food when I m hungry 2 Blue plate special is a really good deal My favorite one is jambalaya but the pulled pork and the fish are also good 3 Vegetarian blue plate option beans veg grain usually not terribly exciting but definitely healthy and tasty in an unassertive way 4 You can get vegetables as a side dish instead of chips 5 Oatmeal smoothie should be absolutely disgusting by any standard of reckoning but it is actually really delicious and can be a meal substitute in a pinch if you re running really late and have to drink your breakfast out of a straw while you run to class 6 All the sandwiches and salads are really tasty and you can get a salad made into a wrap if you want The things that kind of annoy me about Red Oak 1 It gets really crowded over lunchtime and if the short middle aged woman who works there thinks you ve taken long enough to eat your meal she will tell you so Best times to go are before or after the big lunchtime rush 2 It s a bit more expensive than the other lunch restaurants in that part of town but totally worth it especially when you consider that the food is fresh and good for you unlike the other restaurants in Oakland 
2GgfkmDhvVxvglvCZs1A9A CMU You would not think this was going to be a good time Toast is strategically located between the Hillman Cancer Center and Cricket s strip club overlooking the bus highway Parking is on the street The building itself is nondescript Walk in Inside it is warm dark and VERY COZY The crowd is laid back and friendly The menu is sophisticated yet not fussy The restaurant has confidence We went there once with reservations and the manager immediately said I have a seat upstairs but no one is up there I m guessing you want to be downstairs Let me buy you a glass of wine and we ll get you seated when the next table comes up here That s the kind of smart service you want Loved it Overall Very sexy Bring your spouse Bring a date Bring both They ll thank you for it 
2hqpc3ztTxMR-pgrHOC4uA CMU I had heard a lot about Toast from a friend and was excited to try it Unfortunately I was underwhelmed I ordered fish over a bed of rice and the rice was very dry not Basmati try but dry to the point of being hard and undercooked The rest of my food was average but I think there are better restaurants in Pittsburgh at this price range Where Toast shines is as a wine bar The wine list is excellent and the atmosphere is intimate Parties are seated close together and if I were to give Toast another try it would likely be on a date 
2j68598aW38AsusySWzbEQ CMU Orgasm for the mouth soft and sweet but not too sweet I had the nutella banana waffle and adored it My friend had the strawberres and cream and liked hers as well My waffle was not cooked all the way in the middle and I didn even blink an eye I just kept swooping that delicious forkful of belgian inspired wonder right onto my tongue Coffee is priced fairly cheap just drip coffee buts ok in a pinch for coffee I love lattes and cappucinos so I would love if they had this option on their menu but that would make it more of a patisserie than a waffle shop All in all fun little stop great snack to warm you up from your shopping trips down murray ave I don t know how it compares to Oh yeah s over in shadyside but after comparing yelp reviews I chose it over the 3rd waffle shop which is close to Oh yeahs name escapes me The only gripe I have with some of the shadyside eats and treats places including Oh yeah s are the hours catering to nightlifers That may be good for business but you re missing business from us thirty somethings who graduated kindergarten and love to enjoy brunch at brunch time sunday morning to afternoon 
2k3MofKieNIv5I5rXSxcOA CMU Nice atmosphere confusing concept A coworker and I had lunch at the porch a few weeks ago At lunch you place your order and are given an order number and can sit anywhere you like much like Hello Bistro which is run by the same organization We decided to eat outside since it was a nice day someone brought our iced teas and our meals quickly followed The pizza I ordered was good but we weren t sure how to get our iced teas refilled which didn t last very long on a 90 degree day There wasn t anyone going around so I eventually went inside and refilled our glasses with water from the self serve containers Great location ok food but a bit overpriced for self serve 
2n042gTdNDDLLRXWSUftLg CMU This place is a gem The food wine and service exceeded our expectations It s a great place to take a date or just get away for an excellent meal The place is a bit small so if you intend on going be sure to make a reservation a few days in advance on open table The chef apparently did his training in the Richmond VA area so you ll be able to see the southern influence in the menu For me the food completely changed my perception on what southern food could be I had a smoked pork shoulder with pureed sweet potatoes the flavor was indescribable My wife and I will pay this place a visit again for sure 
2nwhw66COV0xdkOmia7_BA CMU I had a terrible experience at Toast after enjoying it several times The food I was served was inedible and I have NEVER before sent food back in a restaurant I was told that they were too busy to make me anything else So I ate salad and dessert for dinner They didn t apologize or try to do anything to make it right I have contacted them numerous times since then and despite being told that it was just a bad night they have not done anything to make it up to me or to make me willing to return So disappointing 
2uKYrNvSbB1rsxwDbkvrfw CMU I went with an out of town friend for lunch and wish I had taken her elsewhere Our waitress looked half asleep and was not knowledgeable about the menu I got a Pizza Margherita and the center was actually soggy How did they mess that up My friend said her sandwich was good but neither of us took the leftovers home with us Meh 
2vc__5mZ2auEaban26OHzg CMU Typical dinner place on the level of a good Applebees with great Margaritas 
37WueYIeisAVl-jRI_LVXg CMU Our reservation was originally scheduled at 830 though we werent seated until nearly 930 i was an out of towner and felt no need to sugar coat how i felt about being made to wait on a leather couch for an hour after 2 glasses of Piscoe when we were seated our wait staff and the host profusely appologized for the wait they were very attentive thereafter and comped our first few rounds but i think it was because i pushed my boobs up mentioned that they should the food presentation was excellent and the taste was slightly above average the shrimp and grits were subpar the Frog was more fishy than i think was acceptable and covered in fava beans although we ordered no salads we were comped one of every one on the menu the duck was excellent as a main course i ordered the suckling pig the meat was tendor and well executed though i thought it looked more like mousakka i was really happy with the presentation i thought for sure i was going to be seeing a little Wilber or Babe on my plate after witnessing what the frog legs looked like Dessert was great im a big softy for creme brulee and they had their own version of tapioca creme brulee French press to cap off the night after all my free Piscoes was excellent All in all if we hadnt been comped so much i think our tab would have been close to 4 or 500 for the 3 of us our bill ran about 160 so i was content 
3D9KN_jX4LOomntxR7fqAw CMU This place is awesome They have a great beer selection the food is just right and the staff is super nice Definitely consider going to Hough s if you are in the area 
3dJqBRcMTKrzA9vVGqrxBA CMU Ahhh Waffallonia The stuff dreams are made of I had eagerly been awaiting the opening of Waffallonia for months as I had heard they would be serving liege style waffles Having seen several glowing reviews about them throughout several publications they were certainly hyped up quite a bit before I finally went I finally made it out for a mini Squirrel Hill Day aka Diabetes Day a trip that consisted of Rita s Waffallonia and bubble tea and indulged myself in some incredible Belgian dessert waffles Waffallonia certainly lived up to the hype Their waffles are slightly crispy on the outside as they have a caramelized exterior and a soft warm interior I got a waffle with Biscoff and whipped cream both of which slowly melted into the crevices and into my heart Seeing as this was the first time I d ever had Biscoff spread I was INSTANTLY HOOKED To this day I go to Waffallonia on a regular basis just to buy a jar of the stuff Only setback is that it s REALLY tiny with very few seats Then again I kind of find that sort of thing cozy and urban Don t worry the prices are decent and it never gets too crowded 
3Er-IaRcV9BgDcqCwHCLOQ CMU BEST place i ve eaten in Pittsburgh in years The service was great try to sit near the back of the restaurant it s cozier The menu was local fresh and delicious i had a steak my husband had fish and chips and our other guest gluten free and vegetarian had a personally created dish that she loved the dessert was great except for that it slipped off of its pedestal as it was being served it was repaired and it was in the end a funny moment they do french press coffee for dessert a nice signature item i would eat here everyday if i could afford to do so definitely check it out 
3eTfDmHO2tpa58GHbIIU1w CMU I love this place mostly because it means I don t have to deal with the oversaturation of bars in the South Side The squirrel cage as some affectionately call it really is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh because it s a little dive y but still hip and has nice booths to sit in where you can just get a cheap pitcher or two and chill with your buds It s also great for people watching 
3gY5aBnd3eYZU4RLojXhZQ CMU I was looking forward to visiting Legume because of its great reviews but was really underwhelmed For starters my friend and I the crudite appetizer The selection of vegetables was interesting but for the amount that were on the plate more of the dipping sauce would have been nice I was surprise by ALL OF THE LAMB on the menu but visited the website once I was back home and realized that there s a relationship with a butcher that involves lamb Still three lamb entrees while there s no chicken and other obvious proteins is a little weird Also the lamb was not prepared that well What was really disappointing though were the two dead fruit flies in my Four Roses The waiter actually returned to the table after taking my drink back to the bar to ask me if I still wanted the Four Roses why was there something wrong with it They brought a replacement but I was surprised I wasn t comped for the drink Also by definition this place is not a bistro but whatever I really wanted to like this place With the exception of the drink containing dead bugs the wait staff was great and I did think they had a nice selection of wines 
3H0WWG7eKDtyX232KFQm9w CMU Ok I know what people are going to say How could you give The Porch only 3 stars Went here for brunch today and the meal had two sides the really good and the bad What we sampled Farm Bread with honey butter apple butter and blueberry preserves Today s farm bread was homemade english muffins and the order came with 2 whole english muffins The muffins were delicious especially enhanced with the different butters and preserves Bianca Pizza Fig Jam Goat Cheese Mozzarella Arugula Truffle oil This was my order and I was pretty disappointed I love all of the things that this pizza promised but I don t think that it delivered Overall the pizza had way to much fig jam and the taste was overwhelming and I wasn t able to taste the other flavors Burger Roasted Red Peppers Caramelizied Onions and a Fried Egg on a Brioche Bun This burger was awesome The burger was cooked rare though we requested medium rare but it was so good it didn t matter Also the egg was perfectly cooked This was messy and delicious in all the right ways Cast iron pork belly Possibly the most disappointing dish of all It was a small cast iron skillet with 10 small chunks of pork belly that were so overcooked they were almost impossible to eat I would probably return for dinner to see what they are able to do but I don t know about brunch The service was good and our waitress fulfilled every request that we had The place was bustling with small and large groups and the noise level was moderate I also liked the decor and the towels for napkins 
3IIZxw-PS7fqkRPAq4qX1A CMU The boy and I were visiting his brother and sister in law who have recently moved to Pittsburg During our day long visit to the Carnegie Museums we decided to stop and have lunch here rather than wander the city looking for food The boy had the steak sandwich which he said was a little greasy but yummy I had the petite salad and mushroom soup it came with a cute little bread bun The salad was prettily presented but the carrot curlicues were very challenging to eat gracefully The soup was very good and the combo only cost 5 We sat by the window which presented a nice view of the fountain and the street 
3j-bT_0Us5t7fE_68iFDAQ CMU Four words bring me to Gullifty s Kenny Blake improv night Kenny will jam for a bit on sax with the band then invite whoever brought an instrument to join in Any jazz night in Pittsburgh will have high standards due to the city s rich history in the genre and Kenny never disappoints It s always an interesting experience As far as food goes the cobb salad has been consistently good and all of the fried appetizers are as good as any diner s I don t eat sweets often so I can t speak for the so called famous desserts Others have complained about the decor but I find the hideousness of it somehow charming 
3kBfvZKxuVKRF68CFUTthg CMU My husband and I adore this place Despite having been incredible fans of Dozen we had them cater our wedding brunches we never went to their Squirrel Hill location But then we discovered Waffalonia and go pretty much once a week It is the perfect opportunity to go on a short walk and eat some absolutely delicious waffles I actually don t mind the seating I don t think the store owners really intend for the restaurant to be a place where you hang out indefinitely with your friends Could it be that Sure But by depriving you of proper seating options which btw I can t say has ever bothered me my husband and I hang out in there with no problems whatsoever they make you focus on what s important and that is how freaking delicious their offerings are My husband and I talk until we get the waffles and then there s just silent munching and mooning over the waffles until they are all gone And then we start talking again usually about how awesome the waffles are and how glad we are that there s a place like this in Squirrel Hill Just as a funny side note for those of us who grew up in the 80s try to think of the Animaniacs song but with Waffalonia instead 
3Lie0rrPAx0RvCpEx9oh0w CMU I love this place because it is consistently a 5 star restaurant Every time you walk through the door you know that you will be having an absolutely superb meal The servers are perfectly attentive without being overbearing They re knowledgeable friendly and pleasantly enthusiastic The food is always fresh well matched flavors and they love to use simple ingredients that create a well balanced course Did I mention their dessert is absolutely to die for Oh coffee too I cannot wait to try the spring menu I ll definitely be bringing a nice bottle of wine and relaxing for awhile 
3NLzZTxqeB10lL5ZWd4qWQ CMU Well my update has half of my original rating Not because of their food but because of the service My friend booked her birthday party there this past Saturday night in their tavern room When we got there the room that was supposed to be set up for her party and guests was completely full of other restaurant patrons She had called in advance to confirm party details and they assured her that everything would be fine Not the case when we got there The person she set the party up with wasn t working that night and it took the hostess 15 minutes to find his note that was left about the party It took another hour for them to clear somewhat of an area for the party which was now squeezed into the bar area The whole area never fully got cleared out for her party and we had to share space with people who they had sat in that hour that we had waited for it to clear out They also put only one server on staff which was insanity and chaos because there were 30 of us at this party I think she got 1 out of every 4 drink orders correct I would still go here to eat for dinner but I would never recommend it to anyone looking to have a party or event here 
3oZQyluDNKqQL6wwZSYHyw CMU Classy place low lighting and candlelit white clothed tables I got the crispy spelt dish I asked for no cheese which was this layered entree of savory spelt crackers and sauteed greens every component was delicious and the dish overall was a good balanced of flavor and texture and seasoned well Sticking to the veg dishes about 15 makes this restaurant a very deliciously affordable upscale experience Highly recommended 
3tVaImCSZQf-zfTo9C3zkg CMU I have been to Red Oak Cafe twice in the last two weeks The first time was hands down great and just to make sure it wasn t a fluke I returned again for lunch Red Oak Cafe gets insanely busy during peak lunch times and rightfully so This gem makes home style food in a healthy and affordable way I ve gotten a turkey sandwich and the roasted pepper sandwich with the home made chips I wish I was eating some right now Portions are good and you won t leave hungry Red Oak Cafe is definitely a keeper though street parking can be a pain 
3WsNf42r0Nm3vrTMcXTPjg CMU As far as Pittsburgh bars are concerned Hough s is a gem amongst semi precious stones The draft and bottle selection is AWESOME This is the perfect place to go if you re interested in trying something new They even offer flights in addition to pints and growlers so you can taste test your way through the draft list Plus there are plenty of tables AND they have a shuffle board 
4aXR-yW8bdfkFW2uZsrlSg CMU Creative menu Nice seating available outside Hard to believe it is owned by eatnpark 
4b3ySHOKDiwibfEVU5cmJg CMU Squirrel Hill Cafe AKA the Cage can be a good time This is primarily a student hippy hipster old regulars and local randoms who live near here spot They sell decent priced pitchers and broadcast the games It does get incredibly packed at times A solid neighborhood bar where you can sit at the jukebox and pick the tunes you feel like head bopping to I always end up putting something on like MGMT or Florence and the Machine I get weird looks when a soulful jazzy soprano starts belting into the room I m usually in my own world at that point but you have to love those you can find any song you can think of music machines I sure do I like pulling up to the bar next to a young college bloke and ordering two fingers of bourbon neat that s always an eye opener from the Punky Brewster girl with the mouse voice sitting next to you The bartenders are attentive and so are the servers when you are sitting at the tables There is an upstairs room but the ceiling is crazy low must just be made for the Shawties I really like that the booths have such high backs so if you are having an intense conversation you can hide in there One last thing this is a smoking bar so if that bothers you don t visit your clothes will be reeking by the end of the night Cheers 
4cpOTV54sfyOKgQ-Fd9ikg CMU Although the atmosphere is great their best quality would be the menu Our waiter informed us that it changes nightly keeping only a few fan favorites for staples One of their staples shrimp and grits Try it you must try it I was torn between a few different starters and entrees but since I chose the shrimp and grits I left happy I had chicken with a squash puree and my bf had potato soup and the hanger steak Both meals were enjoyable but next time I promise to venture out of my comfort zone and get something like the lamb which our waiter referred to as something Fred Flinstone would eat after he slides off his dinosaur with a description like that how can you resist It may be a little pricey but I d say it s worth it The service is great even the man who brought our food and took our plates struck up a conversation about the ever changing menu The cozy upstairs had fireplaces and candles and made a great environment to enjoy dinner It s definitely worth trying and just remember if you get the shrimp and grits you won t be disappointed 
4FG0WUHpLVpTXwj0A_qkkQ CMU I am astonished at all the 4 and 5 star reviews This place is in no way shape or form extraordinary In fact I would go so far as to say it s extraordinary how un extraordinary it is I m not sure if this is a Pittsburgh thing or just that I have gotten lucky since I ve moved here but the service was HORRENDOUS I have never met anyone who cared less about his job than our server Everything a server could have done wrong poorly he did The food was greasy and unremarkable The portions were unreasonably large No human should eat that much food in one sitting I had the pierogies It was a yawn on a plate I know this is a neighborhood comfort food place but I would have preferred eating at a Denny s than here Some would say that I did not have the full experience since I did not have any of the deserts but there is no desert good enough that would make me want to go back 
4jSODFTBCG5xJ9kfrFFnlA CMU As with most places in Pittsburgh I got one hell of a Pittsburgh portion when I ordered my fish sandwich And my friend got the equivalent of three turkey club sandwiches in their turkey club So in terms of quantity of food they have things covered I d say my fish sandwich was borderline generic The fish wasnt anything special and the batter was so thick it was soft on the inside and almost underdone The fish was on top of a normal nondescript roll with a piece of withered warm lettuce The fries were very dark in color but surprisingly soft and ok flavored The turkey club was so large it couldn t fit into anyones mouth it had to be disassembled and eaten in parts other than that the meat was good and moist and the bread was fresh There could have been more bacon to balance out the sandwich there must have been at least a half pound of turkey on there and only a couple strips of bacon The side of potato salad was average Not like it came out of a tub but not like it was something terribly special either was a mustard style with some relish big chunks of potato oh and the mozz wedges were good when are they not good service was great glasses never emptied quick and attentive thanks jake 
4lOrvmRR-kjRUPC8jIrcBQ CMU I ve been to Belium this is the best I ve had since then The attention to the batter is clear the waffle alone is worth 5 stars Combine it with some strawberries or Dave and Andy s Ice Cream It gets better The prices are very reasonable and the waffles are surprisingly filling be open to sharing one 
4MKLOlYvgSimgq_ECzlPRw CMU Toast is an excellent restaurant Wine bar that opened recently on Baum Blvd This new place has a very creative menu and an excellent and constantly changing wine menu The interior of Toast is part of what makes it so comfortable It has exposed wood beam ceilings that the owner found when he renovated the property The walls are painted dark red and there is a very comfortable lounge area to the right of the bar There is dinner seating in the back and additional dinner seating banquet space upstairs Reservations are definitely a good idea but we haven t had much trouble getting a seat at the bar or lounge area The owner Paul always makes a point to get to know all of his guests He is a former Big Burrito restaurateur and he is extremely knowledgeable about the wine and the food on his menu Every dish and bottle of wine has a story behind it If you tell him what you re in the mood for he is always happy to bring you something to try there is more than just the menu So far we ve been there for drinks wine and appetizers We re going to make a point to go for dinner very soon Food we ve tried so far Lamb Ribs these were incredible Tremendous Just try them Right up there on the addictiveness scale with Red Room s sliders Vegetarian Caesar salad not your typical Caesar salad with nuts and strawberries and bagel chips very fresh and different Black Truffle Beets local beets with black truffles very good for a snack while trying the wine Potato encrusted tuna wraps If you know a lot about wine you ll probably have met your match w Paul We re by no means wine experts so we ve just asked for things as vague as a red wine that has a lot of body to it and gotten back a great Syrah Paul also makes arguably one of the best mohito s in town Yes I would actually say that the mohitos here unseat those of Tonic One of the other nice touches that they do also is a give out fresh bread They ll walk around occasionally with a basket full of different kinds of warm bread And for some reason the butter they give you is an addictive substance of some kind Whatever It s good and I m not ashamed to go through multiple ramekins of it during the night Don t judge Even though there s no parking lot street parking is pretty easy to find on the same side of the street And one last thing worth noting This place has one of the neatest bathrooms I ve ever seen in a restaurant Go to the bathroom to the right of the bar in the back The bathroom is almost shaped like a pie slice and the sink is a concrete sink shaped like the room on the right hand side The sink must be 3 feet wide and maybe 8 wide Very different Overall I gotta say that I m very impressed with Toast as you can tell It s nice to go somewhere in Pittsburgh that s a a wine bar b they make a point to know your name and what you like to eat drink c is fun to hang out in for a long time 
4q1AU6C31-rZBZIglbyUjg CMU The old Walnut Grill has been recreated into a modern atmosphere Gone are the warm wood tones and in are the grey and steel It s not a bad thing a fresh look is needed when you take over a well known place We happened to come upon this place on a Wednesday night Why mention the day of the week you ask Because it was half off bottle of wine night Score So of course we picked the cheapest Malbec and had a nice little time with our 15 bottle o wine The menu looked pretty good with some tempting dishes so I went with the Cioppino It came out with massive pieces of shrimp clams mussels and halibut nestled in the middle The thing that really made the dish was the spicy tomato broth It tasted awesome with the whole dish and throw in the garlic crostini to soak up the sauce was awesome At 23 it was well worth it for the amount of seafood you get I d for sure stop in again probably on a Wednesday because this girl likes a deal and some wine 
4vU8NDblwKi3a9g60Y0Eog CMU I was visiting Pittsburgh on business for the week and the manager at my hotel suggested Toast as it was within walking distance from the hotel It turned out to be a great choice I really loved the dimly lit ambiance inside it gave it a speakeasy feel I sat at the bar which had hooks underneath for my purse love when a bar does that The wine list was great but there was no Malbec which is what I usually go for so I decided on a Cote du Rhones per the suggestion of the bartender It was delicious I was stuck between the crispy pork and the scallops but the bartender was kind and knowledgeable he directed me toward to scallops I am so glad he did They were matched with a sweet potato puree corn salsa greens and a maple gastrique I was the happiest girl in town 
4xBIMfoeR5II3T3Nlhlr1A CMU I was headed to a computer lab around lunchtime today when I noticed the building lit up at the edge of Schenley Park in Oakland was it open Having seen the construction progress along throughout the spring and summer months I was anxious to sit down and give this brand spanking new restaurant a try First surprise it is NOT a full service restaurant When I walked in I was promptly greeted and two hostesses handed me a menu They directed me to go to the register when I was ready to order The menu looked fresh seasonal and original and consisted of salads sanwiches soup and wood fired pizzas All of the sandwiches come with either greens or crispy taters with curry ketchup more on that later I finally settled on a sandwich The Roasted Pig pork roast carmelized onions ricotta and red pepper aioli and I wanted to try both of the sides so I asked for the greens and paid for a side of the crispy taters In all my meal was around 13 If I had gotten anything to drink other than water I imagine it would have topped 15 They gave me a number with my order as they bring the food to your table Second surprise The water bar I just wanted water with lunch and the girl who took my order pointed me towards a spot on the bar with two larges containers of water one with cucumbers and one with lemon You can help yourself to all you like of either The flavored water was a nice touch The Porch is seat yourself and I found a table with a great view of the park and a bench seat it was roomy and comfortable I waited about 10 minutes for my food to arrive and the greens looked fresh and bright the bread was crisp and chewy at the same time and the potatoes looked divine First thing to try the greens They were tasty and clearly very fresh if a little bit on the salty side I m not sure WHAT they are tossed in but it was light and tasty I hate when I go to a restaurant and they give me OLD greens lettuce in my salad it is such a huge turnoff Next A bite of those potatoes The crispy taters weren t exactly what I expected them to be the work tater put tater tots into my brain but these were fresh small potatoes diced kind of like homefries and seasoned And on the side was the curry ketchup Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE curry the curry ketchup is GENIUS The curry gives a little kick of spice and a something extra to the ketchup and the seasoned potatoes while good by themselves were really something special with a dab of the curry ketchup on them Note If you re not a fan of curry you CAN request regular ketchup And then my sandwich I can t claim it was a flavor explosion in my mouth but the bread was toasted just the right amound and the onions were sweet and tasty The pork was flavorful and the texture was spot on It wasn t really messy althought the last couple bites kind of fell apart a bit and the cheese didn t stay on the sandwich well Speaking of which I couldn t really taste the cheese although the type of cheese on the sandwich was a mild one so the one thing I would change if I were making the sandwiches would be to use a sharper stickier cheese that would also help hold the sandwich together Someone came by and refilled my water glass several times throughout my meal and another person took my plate away when I was done eating The staff was friendly and attentive and no one acted like they were just there to do a job While I didn t have any alcoholic beverages there was a beer and wine list and The Porch also makes fresh seasonal soda to order Overall a nice place and definetly somewhere I would take a friend for a casual lunch 
52Za3uBM6s1cyb9Nxj3mfA CMU Red Oak is a great spot if you are looking for a change in the food that is typically served in Oakland Red Oak avoids the greasy persona of the surrounding venues and offers a tasteful spin on more nutritious entrees The restaurant offers daily specials which I am quite a fan of Red Oak is very Vegan and Vegetarian friendly Red Oak also offers a wide selection of sandwiches and wraps however given the scarcity of food that is tasteful healthful and served in a creative fashion I reccomend ordering the specials here 
5AHyZJTGgTjm5UsBcBm3Sw CMU Making the reservation easy and friendly Atmosphere quaint and inviting if you do not like tight spaces this isn t for you Menu great I love the small seasonal menu and focus on more day to day options Very well conceived Appetizer delicious The heirloom tomato salad was perfect and the Yellowfin Tuna trio of sushi was even better Entrees mediocre at best The Kung Pao Tofu was lacking in the spicy peanutty character of good Kung Pao My Short Rib Tacos weren t seasoned and the Chipotle Cream was just pink cream Dessert amazing The chocolate was amazing The kicker and reason for my poor rating was when my server dropped a wine glass on my entree plate before I was finished and it shattered It made a HUGE mess and really upset the table next to us I work in restaurants and make mistakes myself but they failed to recover from their mistake The server was extremely apologetic but I had to pay full price for an entree that I was unable to finish and the chef sent out an extra of my date s meal to go They also did not charge me for our 2 bottles of wine its BYOB Had they supplied me with another entree or not charged me for the one they destroyed I would be more gracious I don t intend on coming back 
5dFYOrOUS7sRV_VT_JSU9A CMU What a great Pittsburgh dining experience I am a born and raised Pittsburgh girl who has been living in New York City since 2006 and I can honestly say the food here most definitely compares to any great dining experience in Manhattan It is so wonderful to see some eclectic creative menus popping up in Pittsburgh and I truly enjoyed this aspect of Up Modern Kitchen great menu and well priced for its offerings It took me nearly twenty minutes to decide what I wanted to eat because I was so overjoyed by such appealing and mouth watering options Before being seated I sat at the very relaxed and modern looking bar and started with a pear vodka type cocktail that was DELICIOUS and maybe my new favorite drink The bartender was friendly informative about the drink menu but not overbearing the perfect type of service After being seated and finally making up my mind for food choices I decided on the heirloom tomato salad as an appetizer So delicious summery and refreshing that I probably could have eaten two It was served with some very fresh buffalo mozzarella and a balsamic reduction an updated and tastier twist on the blah and boring basil tomato mozzarella dish I loved it For my entree I had the sauteed chicken with gnocchi and caponata Usually chicken can be dull but I loved everything about the way this dish was prepared Not to mention the chicken itself was cooked PERFECTLY very juicy and tender The gnocchi was freshly made in house and the caponata was the perfect compliment to everything the white balsamic in it added a touch of sweetness that I really liked with the chicken The non cellar wines were all half price which was a great addition to the evening Overall fantastic experience great service and a fantastic addition to the growing Pittsburgh foodie scene P S I noticed there is an intensely negative review on here from someone who didn t even TRY THE FOOD Perhaps next they can write lengthy detailed reviews for films they have only seen the previews for 
5g95DteF19smNUfTYKRCAw CMU Too pricey for the quality 
5H3TohWluEc-F7XUKYfvWg CMU This was my first time to Toast I was impressed overall and would certainly go back I enjoyed the pinot noir block nine as we waited just a few minutes for our table According to my friend the menu hadn t changed much since his last visit but I was still impressed as a first time patron We didn t opt for the tasting even though it was a Tuesday We had the fried green tomatoes with peach salsa as well as the shrimp and grits to start The shrimp and grits were fantastic I then had the beet salad and the hanger steak The steak was cooked to perfection and paired well with the bordeaux blend I sampled the duck confit and thought it was done well but not nearly as good as the steak The peanut butter ice cream sandwich was out of this world 
5HGWC1PcoVnav9lelKQIvw CMU Stopped in for a burger to go Staff were friendly and ordering process was super easy I ordered the bistro burger and it took about 10 minutes for it to be brought out to me which is fair for freshly made food It was interesting that despite the to go order they gave me a number and told me to sit down at a table Fortunately there were empty seats but I can imagine this might be tough if it s packed The bistro burger was tasty but the salt pepper crust on the burger was way too salty Maybe it was just a mistake on my burger but they shouldn t be severely over salting burgers Nonetheless Hello Bistro will get another hello from me pretty soon to give them another chance The build your own salads are worth a shot Update I went back to try the salad I got to customize what I had it in and that s fun After choosing everything the salad is chopped mixed and dressed by a chopper I thought the personal service was really great I got the feeling that the staff were genuinely interested in making the best salad for you I ate the salad until I was full and had enough leftover so that by adding some lettuce I had another lunch I m looking forward to saying Hello again to this place 
5JJSn_P_IsGtvGo-UpRS9w CMU I was happy with the food I got here it s pretty normal casual dining They re supposed to be well known for their desserts but as most other reviews will attest to there s nothing really special about the desserts 
5lXZFMmKUV08uToZYM6XMg CMU Great burgers however this place does not know how to make a cosmopolitan I asked for one and was given a vodka cranberry I was told that I could get a double And that it would cost me 10 bucks it was no Cosmo The owners want to get rich off the booze and that s ok but if you can t get a decent drink then who cares I would spend plenty of good money in this place but I m not spending 18 dollars to get a real drink c mon guys are you telling me you would drink here or entertain a friend here for a great Cosmo go to Tessaros or Emilianos Your money Will ne well spent 
5OZjZ82INpixcLk2M-yk9Q CMU I m addicted I actually signed up for Yelp specifically so I could post a review I ve been to Waffallonia like seven times in the last few days and every time I get something different It s awesome The dough is sweet and chewy the waffles have more of the consistency of thick slightly crispy croissants than of American waffles TRY THE SPECULOOS It tastes like graham crackers and spices turned into a spread like nutella or peanut butter it s truly awesome The only complaint I could have is that the service isn t great about half the time A couple of servers have put their hands all over my waffle when preparing it ew and the plastic cutlery just seems cheap and shoddy not to mention it s really hard to cut your waffle when you re using plastic knives I ve also seen a server picking a hair out of the waffle batter before Gross Other than that highly recommend this place to anyone and I m definitely a hooked customer I wish they were open for breakfast 
5Pfgo9IRWHN7qM9pKyaM9Q CMU After finishing the Race for the Cure my friend and I headed over to The Porch to grab some breakfast brunch The menu wasn t that extensive there was a selection of some breakfast items and then some pizzas from what I recall Maybe their menu offering was different since it was Mother s day and on their website I can t seem to find their breakfast brunch menu My friend went with the quiche and I chose the egg sandwich with cheese and it said it had short ribs but I don t recall any short ribs on the sandwich I have to say the sandwich hit the spot even if it was missing the short ribs It was huge But I was hungry after the run my only complaint was that it was missing something like it needed some other seasoning besides just cheese and eggs perhaps the short ribs would have made the difference The sandwich was served with a side of potatoes they were little round full potatoes that were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside I really enjoyed them I really like the look and feel of this place Open yet comfy 
5rpYfPd7OXthFy3JFo4mPA CMU Okay update 2 With the return of some nice weather my Cousin Cindy and I decided to do some shopping in the neighborhood We hit Ten Thousand Villages and a couple of other places We hit the Murray Avenue Grill for Sunday Brunch Lemme say this M A G s brunch goes beyond your typical eggs pancakes and waffles Now I played it a little safer ordering the ahi tuna salad with grilled tomatoes and mixed veggies I did try the pepper parmesan dressing Here s a hint if you want dressing on your salad and you want to save calories Don t put your dressing on the salad but rather dip the prongs of your fork in it You ll still get the same flavor Cindy tried something adventurous the breakfast rueben This concoction is corned beef Swiss kraut 1000 island dressing between two potato pancakes Oh yes with 2 eggs on the side 
5vUYVahglpH2_xNLErsFuw CMU Stopped in today with my husband and little bro and sis Wow when these are fresh off the waffle making doodad they are GOOD I had the one topped with ice cream Dave Andy s natch It s so rich and just delectable Perfect for sharing too Staff were nice enough and prompt My only complaint again their seating needs some serious rethinking I m pregnant and about the LAST thing I like to do while eating is to simultaneously attempt to balance myself on a tiny slippery wooden barstool Please upgrade Waffalonia 
5WaPnBZpQkR5kg2dAVqEAQ CMU Just got back from a lunch at the Walnut Grill I had been there once before about 3 years ago I don t remember much other than it was a solid meal and the mushroom soup I got was good Anyway it was fairly empty for lunch Perhaps it s because it has a darker atmosphere today was gorgeous out than other SS places I had the lunch special which was a Cajun chicken sandwich with mozzarella basil and roasted red peppers 9 GF got the veggie sandwich which has portabellos spinach feta and onions 9 My sandwich was great The chicken was nicely cooked not dry The mozzarella was nice and big The basil was a nice touch and fresh The roasted red peppers were from a can but were good Served on warm ciabatta Sandwich wasn t overly salty either The fries were surprisingly good GF s veggie sandwich was equally good I usually don t like spinach but the bite I had was nice and feta mushroom y She ate all of it which rarely happens I also got a Proper draft which is an English Pale Ale It was quite good Nice and malty with minimal hops 
5WiIQYgMkT-t1NlPVP1tKw CMU I went with a group from work to 1947 Tavern for happy hour and dinner I arrived around 5 30pm and the place was almost empty The atmosphere is warm and welcoming even without a lot of people I was the first one there so I sat at the bar and ordered a beer The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable He told me about the drafts they had and described one from Troegs that I wasn t familiar with As the others in my party trickled in he helped each of them pick drinks and made one girl an impressive mojito that involved him putting something in a bag and beating it loudly against the bar i think it was the sugar He told us that happy hour was ending soon so we hurried up and ordered 2 appetizers I believe they were BOGO Unfortunately everything with crab was off limits he informed us because they were out of it We ordered the fries and hummus Both were fantastic We moved to a table and ordered dinner I got the mac n cheese with bacon The portion size here is huge folks get ready for left overs I also ordered a side salad I highly recommend this place for these reasons 1 The house salad is delicious and our waiter brought me 4 different dressings to choose from I could have poured all of them on if I wanted to get wild 2 The mac n cheese is a little different like some of the other reviewers have mentioned It could be a little creamier ITS STILL DELICIOUS I had enough left over to use as a side the next day for my husband and I at dinner 3 Our bartender turned waiter superbly handled our large group and wasn t phased by working with multiple cards for the bill I should mention that the place got VERY BUSY around 6 30 7 00pm I was hesitant to give 1947 Tavern a try since it had that trying too hard to be trendy sort of feel to me I was pleasantly surprised by fantastic service and yummy food Next time your around Ellsworth give it a try with so much awesome competition in that area I d love to see 1947 do well 
5x74-wH2eUDpn1_B182ZSw CMU Great wine selection The food wasn t as impressive as I was expecting It tasted good but I just expected more for my money I went here for my 21st birthday and was kind of bummed that I didn t get carded ha My date and I ordered two appetizers because I didn t feel like spending a lot of money here on food Shrimp Grits This had a very sugary taste that I kind of was tired of after a few bites Seems like an odd combination at first but not bad tasting The portion was pretty small as well To me not worth 9 Pork and Duck Rillette The duck was pretty decent better than what I have had other places But again it was very small 9 We wanted to do the tasting menu for the food but I feel that would be more appropriate if you had a larger crowd and could pass dishes around The wine made the night I enjoyed the Riesling Note I wouldn t bother paying the money for the wine tasting because you can just get little samples of whatever you please for 2 00 per 2oz I believe with the tasting you only get like four samples for 20 00 so might as well try more and spend less I love how you can choose different sizes of wine the taster 1 2 glass full glass and bottle Way fun The dessert wines were my favorite I ordered the Ice Wine Riesling VQA and was pretty impressed I m a sucker for sweet wines so these were perfect I m pretty sure you couldn t go wrong with many of these I wasn t really crazy about how small the area was inside it def gets packed in there and you can hear conversations from the tables next to you Overall the atmosphere was pleasant server was very helpful in recommending different choices I would come back 
5XG4wP8Wx_T5EJPC_1JHhA CMU This place is totally solid I got a grilled cheese with tomato and it came with a side of unexpectedly good asparagus 
5z1FxpRsnsLbf5OEH3TGfg CMU If i wanted to eat in a place that was adorned like my grandma s kitchen and use a dish towel for a napkin I wouldn t pay this much I d get my dinner for free at my grandma s I am very disappointed in the change that this place has taken on I hate rating places low I really really do just look at my other reviews And if you read this review please understand that this place irritated me so much that I didn t even eat here we didn t get that far before we left and went elsewhere So admittedly the food may be wonderful This review is solely about the atmosphere that turned us away My girlfriend and I loved Walnut Grill The atmosphere the classiness without being pompous the food the drink everything about this place was great The Bad Last night we went there to meet friends and were shocked to see that the place was completely different Up Modern Kitchen is a sad attempt to be trendy and my suspicion to follow the success that the Eat n Park conglomerate has had with The Porch at Schenley Plaza We walked into what USED to be an appropriately low lit dining room with candles on the tables and found that what was one cozy and welcoming was more sterile and harsh The place felt cold and too open the tables too close together and the exposed flood lightbulbs in the ceiling didn t make it cooler to be in there it just made the place seem unfinished and not in a good way We got a table for four and sat down to a setup that featured tea towels or dish towels that looked like they were purchased at Ikea instead of napkins Again this didn t make the place cooler it made it seem like it was trying too hard Someone then came by with a glass bottle featuring a resealable top with a rubber gasket akin to a Grolsch beer bottle poured us both water and set the now almost empty water vessel on the table This was another thing that seemed to be done for atmosphere but only made the place more pompous seeming Once we looked at the menu found little that sounded worth staying and saw the higher than expected prices we were so turned off that we left It would be one thing to have this atmosphere at an inexpensive place or to have expensive prices and be down to earth but this had a faux down to earth feel waiters in jeans and faux bamboo tables coupled with high prices an an attitude that says we do things differently soooo you know we re pretty trendy I love an atmosphere like this for a place like LuLu s Noodles in Oakland because well they actually have great cheap food This place just gave us a bad vibe The Good The staff was nothing short of friendly and nice so please don t think that the personnel seemed to be pompous personally It was the atmosphere and the way that the management has clearly set things up to try to entice people The staff seemed really great and didn t give us any grief when we left That is to their credit Also there was no wait at all to get a table for four And this is Shady Side Good for customers not so much for business Conclusions And Admission The vibe of this place was so faux folksy coupled with such high prices that we were turned away by our own disappointment before the rest of our party ever sat down I didn t want to be there at all Admittedly WE DIDN T TASTE THE FOOD and THEIR CHEF MAY VERY WELL BE AMAZING but without being able to find anything on the menu that enticed us to stay in that atmosphere I worry that they won t be able to get people to try it I m not against giving their food a fair shot and then altering my feelings but it would have to be somewhere that was being more honest about what it really was 
6BW42xbx6oDlIavPhL2Amw CMU A OK FOOD RIGHTING A WRONG Been here once with friends and had a good soup and sammie lunch so when my hubby and my kiddo where in the area with me I suggested we pop in Food is reasonably priced considering it is located on the most expensive avenue in the burg It is also kid friendly no one is gonna care if my kid is a little LOUD Anyway good service and a great chicken salad on my side but as my hubby bit into the center of his chicken sammie he pulled back and found a totally raw pink center An initial minor freak out occurred mostly cause we re so programmed to utterly and completely fear raw chicken came down off the ledge and told the waitress She profusely apologized and then the manager came over and apologized as well They both asked if my hubby wanted anything else but he was too weirded out to eat anything else Then the manager comped the whole meal as a mea culpa yea Latin That was fair and kind and because of that I would go back 
6H-gMieRMsTYSb8VvmXzLQ CMU This place is alright I ve never gone for dinner only for lunch as I worked in the neighborhood They don t really have any lunch specials per se and the place seemed completely empty The service was friendly the food was just okay Nothing really memorable and the prices are a bit high 
6KqCMOz9WqTNFaweEIBmZw CMU I ve been once and was blown away it was one of my best restaurant meals in Pittsburgh having lived here 15 years The first course beans with a wonderful vinaigrette was excellent the main course scallops was excellent and the dessert chocolate cake was excellent I can t think of many other Pittsburgh restaurants where each dish made me think wow with each bite Hyeholde comes to mind Two deficiencies it s often crowded and when it is it s loud I got there at 8pm on a Tuesday evening and there was a 15 min wait a reflection of its popularity The repeat business it seems to draw within the local neighborhood reminds me of Point Brugge Cafe I think Legume should do something to soften its acoustics If you re looking for a romantic evening with private conversation this may not be the place because the tables are quite close together But the food is excellent Portions are a good size i e smaller than Pittsburgh norms Prices are a little high maybe 45 per person They don t have alcohol they re BYOB Reservations for parties of 6 or more only Their menu is a little heavy on the meat for my taste I would have appreciated more vegetarian options 
6LBOAjoWYKxEWCivd_I3_A CMU It is a small cute place Creates nice atmosphere in particular for special occasions Other than this food is good but not the best ever Their selection is fairly small I could say but I guess it suits its size as well Service is very good you do not get overwhelmed with questions but at the same time you have the attention you need By all means I will visit it again but it s not top on my list 
6LLIwM4AT4opUBco2IHs2Q CMU First let me say they opened last week so I understand there may be some kinks to work out but it was pretty bad From the first moments inside we felt a sense confusion and of being rushed I ordered a burger fries and a side salad and told to go to the dressing station and someone will get you the dressing of your choice along with an order number to put on the table I waited in line for 10 minutes at the dressing station before interrupting someone to get my dressing my meal was delivered to me while waiting in line The place was packed and we waited another 10 minutes for a table to clear You could see many unhappy faces from the customers but the staff was remarkably upbeat The food Their marketing reads Yes we ve been flippin burgers since 1949 you don t do something for that long without getting preeeetty good at it The burger tasted like a processed frozen burger from a cafeteria it was bland spongy The salad was nice but the red wine vinaigrette tasted like something out of a bottle Not what I was expecting If you re looking for good burgers walk a bit further and go to 5 guys If you like salads they have a great selection but I suspect the dressings are pretty much off the shelf Someone that I had lunch with told me said the food is straight from Eat and Park so if that s your taste you might like it 
6R52yUMNN592Nr99O4g21w CMU We went her on Easter Sunday while visiting Pittsburgh Most other brunch places were closed or had long waits We sat right down in a mostly empty restaurant The decor is fantastic and the atmosphere very homey The restaurant overlooks Schenley Park and offers outdoor seating during warm weather The food was mixed and showed its Eat N Park roots We ordered a pan of the sticky buns to split with our coffee They were on special but they were overly doughy and flavorless The icing was bitter Overall not even up to the standards of its parent company Two of us had chorizo and eggs The eggs were a little bland and the chorizo as well The crispy taters were spot on with a tasty curry ketchup The pico de gallo on the side was very well done Overall average My other friend ordered the Eggs Benedict special The eggs were horribly overcooked solid throughout Bernaise sauce was delicious but the entire thing was on a hamburger bun instead of an English muffin Needless to say he was not impressed Overall a nice location and an interesting option on Pitt s campus but average an brunch in a great setting 
6ToMbChHfhiCPmze5NVOPA CMU I have continued going back to Elbow Room hoping for a different experience No matter how many times I order from them they always leave something off my burger I do not understand how a burger with apple cheese and bacon always end up missing at least one of the 3 items I am just happy it has the burger on it So tired of this place I have talked to their chefs and managers about this issue and it has never been resolved If you get takeout from this place I suggest always opening your box before you leave to make sure it is all there 
6wX1dmQQLAhHW--h-ANtng CMU Not impressed Salads need to come out before your main course you shouldn t have to ask for it it should be assumed The Caesar salad was under dressed and the croutons weren t crunchy more like eating cubes of regular bread placed in your salad When asked for horseradish for prime rib the response was that it comes with the plate only to find out that the sauce has a tiny amount of horseradish that u can barely taste The staff was inexperienced and we had to ask mutiple times for simple things that you shouldn t have to ask for like refills a pen to sign your name the receipt etc The atmostphere was OK I guess but the meal was barely acceptable I won t be back 
6YH-Yby-g_JNeKjBxFDTXA CMU THE REAL PITTSBURGHERS PLACE FOR DESSERT Forget the Cheesecake Factory If your a real burgher you know this is the place for a tasty dessert Menu Fav Key Lime Pie The Key Lime is very light and fluffy fools you into not feeling too guilty But honestly their are dozens of desserts Try it out And by the way you won t break the bank on dessert here like a certain place and their 8 cheesecake 
72BqOqx5KK_WQ3ulrCsQGg CMU After reading wonderful reviews and hearing from friends that this was a wonderful restaurant in Pittsburgh I was slightly disappointed in my personal experience at this restaurant My party of 8 went to Toast for dinner on a Friday night My first impression of the restaurant was that the downstairs was cozy and seemed ideal for a glass of wine and intimate dinner However our group was seated upstairs at a very nice private round table Our waiter was extremely knowledgable on the wine list and suggested a wonderful Pinot Noir I really liked how you can either do a taste half glass glass or bottle of the wines It makes it fun if you want to try a few different ones throughout the meal The meal was not rushed at all and our party was given time to talk amongst ourselves before ordering For a starter I ordered the Beet Salad which was delicious The black truffles on the beets were excellent and this was a great way to start the meal Some of the other salads ordered by our group were the Spinach Salad and Vegetarian Caesar The Spinach Salad looked great and was enjoyed by everyone who ordered it The fried egg and thick chunks of bacon make it special and something that you can t find anywhere else For our main entrees our group ordered Flounder with blue crab New York Strip Steak and the Gerbers Farm Chicken I was one of the people to order the flounder our waiter recommended this as his favorite fish on the menu and since I have a crab allergy they were able to substitute asparagus instead Unfortunately I found the fish a little bland and was disappointed that I did not get the creamed corn with my meal I along with the two others who ordered the fish would have liked to have seen more of a sauce on the fish Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dish The Steak came with what was described as an awesome roasted cauliflower for a vegetable and the chicken looked delicious Looking back on it I would have gone with a different main course but all in all we had a relaxing and enjoyable experience I d like to go back and try something different on the menu and since the menu changes practically daily I don t see this being a problem 
75wb5Y3oXfpFVmwZx7BVSw CMU Overall my experience was good and I will come back to try it again mainly because there are many other items on the menu I want to try Our waitress may or may not have been new but she was not well versed in the wines on the list However I still managed to choose a wine that I was very pleased with Tempernillo Finca Vieja Crianza Castilla La Mancha Spain 2007 I choose the lamb meatloaf at the recommendation of the waitress because it will only be on the menu for a short while and it was great It had the perfect amount of crispiness on the outside without being overcooked on this inside The atmosphere is one that is good for many occasions celebrations dates or outings with friends 
77oTMX2SDNc-18c_Ly8vDQ CMU I love this place for its salad This was the first place that I had the Pittsburgh Salad and I have been hooked The french onion soup is also very tasty but the other stuff on the menu is okay Personally stick to the salads soups and calamari It is a bit pricey but its worth it once in awhile 
78T6cBy2THGjpkEFkAFrlA CMU Highs and lows NF and I walked in and instantly realized that we were the youngest people in the place not counting service by about 20 years And everyone was either speaking really loudly or there is nothing in the building designed to muffle noise But they re moving Things will probably change right The service was not unfriendly but I wouldn t call it friendly either The atmosphere says hey come on in we re approachable but the servers don t smile Often when NF and I eat together one of us has the much better meal This one went to him I ve never liked duck but he ordered it and legume s duck made me a believer My nettle soup however tasted like nothing Actually and specifically nothing at all Maybe vague potato His pork cheeks were porky and delicious but my chicken under a skllet was also leaning toward blandness Although my assessment isn t totally fair because NF has made the same thing but on the grill which I think vastly improved the flavor But if a non chef guy at home can make a better version of a thing at the restaurant then hmm Overall it was a nice meal for a reasonable price and I see no particular reason to rush back 
7hmeamupCuCQnyBu8ue9ow CMU No complaints here I don t live that close to the restaurant so I ve just gotten desserts here but they come highly recommended 
7l0F05cd4dXOg-6_hEuVig CMU It was awesome Pampered by the hostess Mary Lots of complementary extras Great for romantic dinner too although I went alone 
7Q2DhCVL7YVC_agxeNPKAg CMU Perhaps the best restaurant in Pittsburgh 
7rgFPFhDl_0C_4UX4yPDcQ CMU So after reading all the bad reviews for The Porch at Schenley on here and there are plenty I was VERY skeptical to try it this weekend We had friends staying in Oakland for a wedding and we preferred to do brunch in a more traditional brunch spot that we know like Lawrenceviille downtown etc When I heard we were going here I was bummed AND BOY WAS I WRONG Exceptional breakfast Exceptional Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is I felt the menu could have had a few more brunch items like sweet items pancakes a French Toast something It was pretty much all savory And they had some basic items that coulda been better Basic items that were off biscuits Ordered a side of buttermilk biscuits with apple butter The biscuits had been run through a toaster Everyone knows biscuits should be warm and soft not toasted But flavor wise they were awesome and the apple butter was to die for Several of us at our table had the egg sandwich on rustic farm bread with gruyere It was to die for Such good bread And perhaps the best home fries I ve had in Pittsburgh Everyone else at our table had the crab eggs benedict and felt it was one of the best eggs bennies they ve ever had loved that the English Muffin appeared home made My best friend had the biscuits and gravy and was so complimentary on how spicy the gravy was and how it somthered the biscuits just right My wife ordered the burger with egg on it and her medium burger was SPOT ON Most Pittsburgh restaurants think medium is this pinkish grey color This was a textbook medium hot and red with the blood just starting to run through it Exceptional burger Presentations are great pork belly served in a cast iron skillet Old milk bottles served the water Napkins were a cloth washcloth Great presentations exceptional Worth the trip DO IT You won t regret it ON the way out we saw the pizzas presented on half pans baking sheets Killer presentation KILLER 
7Wjow4U86cYyF0jy0PMVug CMU What a welcome addition to Oakland dining Now those of us who have no desire to get mediocre undergraduate fare at places like Jo Mama s Fuel and Fuddle The O Panera etc have a much more civilized and still economical option Porch has great outdoor space tons of natural light a semi open kitchen fresh and seasonal ingredients and admirably quick service given how busy it is around lunch time It s also a good spot to have a beer after work school Nice job Porch Or should I say Eat n Park 
7zIjTLpmyGX2rHsXFTvj8w CMU What I hate about salads is not having enough dressing and or mixing it into the lettuce completely No joke I put my salads in a big container at home and shake them in dressing before eating them But now we have Hello Bistro I went for the first time today and I love it I got the chicken apple salad and it was very very good Everyone was very helpful and friendly too I ll definitely be back 
83l18K1rF84Xc9Cteppagw CMU Every time I have been to Cafe Sam I have been very disappointed On my most recent visit the waiter was overbearing the menu confusing and the food unremarkable Avoid this place 
8EFzD87O2HjU9wojzDq7cQ CMU 1947 Tavern is right next to Bites and Brews Its Ooooook But thats about it If you re looking for something trendy 1947 Tavern is trendy Its cute on the inside The bartenders are Ooooook I generally always ask the blonde that works there for my drinks because shes quick and shes effecient and pays attention Other than that 1947 is what it is A trendy bar next to Bites and Brews As far as drinks go Their Bourbon Lemonade is definitely yummy you can request for your favorite spirit to be mixed in I generally ask for Chamborde but have fun with it I ve also had the Georgia Peach Eh personally its too Bourbony for me not enough peach flavor to it I just request more simple syrup to be added but thats MY preference I will give them this though Bourbon Pecan Pie YUMMY 3 STARS 
8EQe9Rmnlz70O9IVGs1yYg CMU It was a beautiful night so we sat outside Although the tables are right at the bus stop so there are buses starting and stopping it was okay Inside as we learned when we used the rest rooms was MUCH noiser The Food was EXCELLENT We had the tempura green beans and sweet potatoes to start Yummy For entrees we had the signature Kobe meatloaf which was very good No wonder it is the signature dish We also had the veggie pesto tower which was good but small was it a first course I didn t think so Dessert was worth the trip Croissant bread pudding served in strips alongside popcorn ice cream We might go again when it is warm enough to sit outside but will be hesitant to go inside 
8FfWtt0w2n0h-6jyJj_dQw CMU Well I thought Walnut Grill was terrible and boring so I m glad it was revamped The new restaurant is nothing at all like Walnut Grill and that s a good thing I was actually expecting to be disappointed here but I totally wasn t We split a bunch of small plates and I adored just about all of them The Peri Peri Wings were super juicy and tender with a spicy Masala esque sauce and a side of Raita for dipping instead of bleu cheese or ranch Also loved the Habanero Relleno and I m normally not a big fan of stuffed peppers It came with a big slab of smoked meat I forget what it was but it was super fatty and amaaaazing The fries with truffle mayo were right up there vying with all the best fries in Pittsburgh and actually tasted almost identical to the widely loved version found at Meat Potatoes Finally the Caprese Salad was fresh and just short of perfect not enough mozzarella too much tomato But I m also a Caprese addict I make it for myself at least once a week so my preference is just cheese centric We finished with a honey polenta for dessert and it was the only thing that totally lacked in presentation looked like a plate of mush but it certainly didn t let me down in flavor So color me impressed Up The food was actually very reminiscent of Root 174 which is one of my favorite places to eat in the city Definitely 5 star material BUT I have one complaint and one complaint only What s up with the pricing on the main courses The small plates of which there is a large variety are all reasonable in price and you can definitely make a good meal of them as we did But the mains seemed a little too pricey to me Nothing sounded amazing enough that I would consider paying 23 36 a plate for it Most of the other New American places in the city including M P Cure Root 174 and Salt offer slightly cheaper options with more creative ingredients This place has a very down to earth and casual atmosphere that doesn t jive with paying 28 for halibut or 36 for filet mignon Still this place has a ton of potential and I already have a craving for those awesome wings I hope this place gets more attention because I honestly hadn t heard of it at all until I noticed their sign Definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood and a solid attempt at making the yuppiest street in Pittsburgh a little bit more cool 
8fsU0GionN3hZFsD8b4e-A CMU During the three or four times I ve been here I ve had friendly service some decent drinks and mixed luck with the food On my last visit I tried the fish tacos and was sorely disappointed the tortillas appeared to have been recently revived from the freezer and the quality of the fish seemed subpar Still this is Pittsburgh so I don t really expect to get decent fish tacos here but like to try occasionally on the off chance that I will succeed Another failure in my opinion the fish tacos came with french fries Who serves fish tacos with french fries Maybe if the fries had actually been decent I wouldn t have minded so much but they were overly salty and soggy I ve had better luck here with the salads and would recommend those 
8Io9GFlnPoLzTQlJV9lweQ CMU This place is outstanding Dave always has the freshest ingredients and the staff is so friendly The best breakfast in Oakland yes better than Pamela s 
8KrbT7V4FQBy2DrDId5Geg CMU Breakfast and dessert together Why yes please I love the concept of eating a crispy golden brown waffle with ice cream fruit or other sweet treats It comes in servings just right enough to satisfy a craving and not enough to overwhelm you with food coma It may seem small when you first get a plate but once you re finished it s a nice finish I personally love the Nutella Banana combination What genius decided to create such a lovely marriage Keep in mind the location is quite small You almost feel like you re in some long walk in closet so don t expect too much in terms of seating it s mainly a plank of wood jutting out of the wall with bar stools My husband and I came Sunday morning after church and it was a good time to go since it was a little empty They open early for a Sunday perfect for those who love to have dessert for breakfast 
8LZZLws5vrux6wLWeAaY9A CMU Solid 3 stars contemplating on 4 but really only a 3 5 stars I really liked the interior of this place especially the bar area with all the wood The ambiance for the upstairs is more date ish although I was here with Yelp friends We decided to do the tasting menu since we went on a Tuesday Tasting Tuesdays but without the optional wine pairing for an additional 20 It doesn t really make financial sense to do the optional wine pairing b c you get 4 tastes of wine and when you look at the menu there s only one taste size that is 5 all the others range from 2 50 3 50 Let s do some simple math 4 wine tastes should at least be 5 to make this worth it 4x5 20 So I opted to just get 2 half glasses of wine which came under 20 So the tasting was a bit odd b c it s like a grab bag of items You don t get to choose what you want there is not a set tasting menu it s a anything that the chef server decides to give you you eat sorta deal and that s your tasting So everyone at our table got different dishes from each other at each course 4 courses total It would have been nice to either have received the same thing for each course so we could discuss even if we didn t know what it would be or if there was a set tasting menu Bizarre While I enjoyed some of the dishes I had fried tomatoes caesar salad with strawberries hanger steak I wasn t overly impressed As you can see I only remember 3 out of the 4 dishes I had nothing too memorable An annoying this was before they serve you they ask if there are any allergies and how you d like your meat to be prepared I explicitly said MEDIUM WELL since I m not a big meat eater I prefer my meat to be cooked Well when I got the hanger steak it was mostly red it was tender but it was still annoying b c what s the point of telling them you re preferences if they re not going to do anything about it The service was a bit off as they didn t really check on us and the server wasn t too great with recommendations he had none especially when it came to the wine But they did redeem themselves and acknowledged their negligence and gave us a free tasting of wine but it was super sweet wine so none of us finished it and then they gave us a selection of free desserts They gave us a lemon pie of some sort rhubarb something peanut butter ice cream sandwich and balsamic ice cream I liked the lemon pie and the peanut butter ice cream sandwich The free wine and dessert was a nice gesture on their part but couldn t make up for the other issues 
8M_dvh3pdxFYGrm_f1czfA CMU Dessert Only I got the turtle cheesecake and it was D Licious It was tall and wide and full of caramel and nuts The peanut butter chocolate cheesecake was a hit as well Great place for a late bite to eat 
8r54QkzBD1lfmqbJ86t-Yg CMU I really really wanted to like this place Our interaction began superlatively when we made the reservation for six on Open Table and then had to change it to eight by phone They were more than accommodating and pleasant Walking in once we found it the street is sort of dark and the awning is also dark we were seated immediately Our food was superb The appetizers were tasty and sufficient And the wine list was great They obviously have an awesome chef because the food quality was superb Both in presentation and culinary art each plate was very appetizing from the wonderful rockfish to the steak plates The risotto was also as tender as it could be deliciously flavored The downside came in the service which was at best passable at worst an exercise in a near nervous wrecking ball on the part of the waitress We sat close to 20 minutes to be tended to And when one of our party remarked to the waitress after being seated that the home made bread was subject of outstanding reviews the waitress looked at us with almost a horrified face and told us that it had been a disastrous day and that it had included a breakdown in the bread machine and blah blah blah Why anyone would greet a full table of eight and set that tone for the rest of the evening is beyond me That was our welcome to the service Uhhmmmm Then it went downhill from there To make a long story short I ll paraphrase an old military performance review adagio Sets low standards for him herself and fails to achieve them That was our service evening 
9CNDFLlqPJ_vM6sLNQM3yA CMU It s really hard for me to review this because one part of me really liked it and the other part of me was so annoyed by it that I feel like I can t be truly biased Let me say this I love the overall look of the place It doesn t feel like a typical restaurant you d find in the city It s hard for me to put a nail on the overall look of the place but it s nice It has a nice and comfortable theme to it Nothing is overly done It s stylized without being overly dramatic The pizza I ordered was amazing Actually the pizza s we ordered were both amazing I m not always a big fan of thin crust pizza because I m kind of a pig and like my carbs but this was pretty darn stellar I loved the presentation and how the different spices cheese were laid out for you My biggest grip was the service It was truly horrible My biggest gripe about places is when the service is good only after the check has arrived Did you forget that there was about 40 minutes prior when you were supposed to take care of me We had other servers coming to us because they saw the lack of service being provided which I ll say is very nice but that s not their job Would I go back Yes Would I ask for a new server if I got the same one as before Most definitely 
9DXcoFdtQlmWhzBmA7ZJuw CMU Waffle shops oh how I love thee Reminds me of Europe Americans should really learn to embrace waffles and crepes more And Nutella Service was fast and friendly Shop is small and hot so I d suggest finding a nice stoop or bench to eat your waffle and depending how you order it it can be messy Forget the Cold Stone around the corner Go here I promise you ll enjoy it 
9H7FnjQLXkLaS7iw8nFk3Q CMU Cafe Sam is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the area As others have said it is somewhat quirky the mannequin they have seated at the bar is a bit unnerving the first time you notice it but the food is consistently good the portions are nicely sized and the prices are excellent especially if you order the right stuff The interior is decorated with lots of antiques and stained glass and the upstairs patio is really a fantastic retreat from the Oakland Bloomfield area if you go on a night when the weather is good They always have a ton of daily specials as well as drink specials the 4 cosmo is certainly worth every penny of my grad student salary Every time I visit there s always been a point in the meal when one of the servers brings around a sampler tray with an appetizer or a drink they ve offered samples of things varying from strawberry or peach daquiris a pizza appetizer cold berry soup etc I HIGHLY recommend the baked almond crusted brie appetizer the cheese is delicious with the almonds and raspberry sauce and they arrange tons of fresh fruit on the plate for you to munch at as well We never fail to order this when we stop by 
9kuref2w3-vnciFX4-QxFw CMU I liked the old Elbow Room location better but even then it would have been a 3 star place Meh food meh booze beer selection and most of all meh service Went to lunch and shopping in Shadyside and figured since I had not been here since the move I should check it out I felt like I was in the Old Max and Erma s still where the last time I had been there was around 1998 in college When a place is not busy and you still wait for what seems like an eternity for your initial drink order then even longer to order food and never got checked on again until the check came it leaves you not wanting to return and that is the case for me and the Elbow Room 
9m7yihlvpcH2-YpKgygo-w CMU Pittsburgh welcomes drum roll the advent of salads to this city Finally you can actually go to a place within Pittsburgh city limits and have a salad made your way How this works is that you walk into the restaurant order your selections and pay immediately after you order They have other items aside from salads such as sandwiches soups and burgers These items will be served to you by your number while you re seated at your table If you got a salad you will continue to stay in line as an employee builds your salad for you kind of like Chipotle You ll pick out a green to base your salad all the toppings and watch them take out see saw like knives to chop your salad down and hand it back to you For about 7 you can have unlimited toppings and for 9 you can have unlimited toppings with some sort of protein The toppings include cheeses hearts of palm artichokes beets and everything else you would expect at an actual salad bar Their fountain drink selection is also quite nice Lots of cane sugar options so nothing with that high fructose corn syrup The options include ginger ale cream soda cane sugar coke root beer etc I love it Now another thing is according to this restaurant in order to be a new and trendy restaurant in Pittsburgh you have to have alfresco dining provided by a garage door window This makes the environment very nice Obviously it s nice wood that they have used since you can smell the wood s scent Only cons the salad making line can get a little congested since it s one person with you the entire time to make a salad as opposed to an assembly line system like Chipotle Also they do not have spinach as a green base option just different types of lettuce at least there s Romaine 
9N6cOi64rjeGG3kOB9yTaA CMU This is one of the best treats I ve had I definitely recommend it for all of it s options are delish I might go broke because of this new discovering 
9WZ9xCcLyWBCHZbbRTcScQ CMU Affectionatly referred to as the squirrel cage the squirrel hill cafe rules It s got a relaxed atmosphere cheap food cheap beer and decent surroundings The crowd is often odd with some random creepy people at the bar often gatherings of older folks at the early side of the evening and as it gets late lots of alternative college aged kids roll on in It s good times Have a few pitchers stumble home and you ll be back at the squirrel cage 
a-MrJdh-RwWbf6Q0woSRrA CMU this is EXACTLY the kind of place I want in Shadyside I m a business traveler who frequents the east coast and this is what dining is and should be Great apps interesting small plates and large plates I don t know many people that sit down at a restaurant and only want one thing the innovative menu gives you the flexibility to choose multiple items The prices are absolutely reflective of the quality and taste If you think this is overpriced you re used to the 2 for 20 AppleBee s quality of food I sat at the bar and had the pleasure of having Christopher as my bartender and server Having waited tables for 6 years I can tell you that he was incredibly professional and HONEST about recommendations This is definitely where i HAVE to eat 
a1fv6KUY1uc2blRgYgpSCw CMU Great selection of beer That s a good start although they were out of Flower Power IPA but found a nice surprise in a Copper Kettle dark IPA made right in their own brewery It was fifty cent wing night and good friend of Joe Ross was eagerly waiting to order his garlic wings I looked over the menu and saw a build your own burger menu Two vegan options portobello mushrooms and a veggie patty They also had beef bison and another offering that I can t remember All build your own burgers start at 7 bucks except the bison which is 9 Add ons are extra cheese is 75 cents or a buck veggies are 50 cents each sauces are 50 cents I m sure it adds up and your burger could be 14 bucks if you go overboard I decided on the hummus I got a huge bowl complete with carrot sticks celery and pita not baked though soft and fresh Unfortunately the hummus was rather unremarkable bland and could have been made better with some garlic some herbs or even a bit of salt and pepper I looked on the bar for salt shakers or a bottle of tabasco but none were to be found Which is a shame with all the cooking shows on TV that the cooks here can t properly season a dish Next time i ll build a burger and see what happens Ross loved the six wings and devoured them with a Sam Adams Oktoberfest Hough s seems more like an Elk s lodge or Eagle s club There s room for improvement and I hope the cook finds the salt shaker 
A1jQeDGU8Awn9mfbtSAduQ CMU Another great restaurant in the Pittsburgh area We tried several items here and nothing fell flat The food was perfectly executed cooked well presented well I was surprised how large the space was in this place given that the menu is constantly changing I expected a small dining room but it s surprisingly spacious I would guess that they have to run out of things but we didn t have any problems with that while we were here The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars there aren t a lot of entrees on the menu when I was there there were only 3 proteins one was salmon two were steak If you re not a meat eater you re limited to the one bowl suppers the options are okay but appear to be carb heavy Looking at today s menu there are 4 protein options so maybe I just caught it on an off night Prices are reasonable given the execution I ll add this place to my special rotation One last thing we tried buttermilk panna cotta if you see it on the menu you have to get it It s freakin fantastic I m not normally a dessert person but I could have this every night 
a2bK6ZBADBCNjEEIwSu6ng CMU Seriously one of the most interesting new places around It s tiny but makes up for its lack of square footage in deliciousness One waffle will fill you up for sure It s crispy and sugary on the outside then delicious and doughy on the inside I wish I wasn t at work or I d go get one right now Seriously do yourself a favor and try Waffalonia you will be back for sure 
a9dGttVN2Wt68HEUmZIDsw CMU Elbow room has some great things going for it It has a reasonable menu without being bar food They changed the menu recently so the food has changed somewhat mostly for the better The Johnny Appleseed Chicken Sandwich was very good Salads are also good choices They moved all of their wine to a wall so there is no list you get up and explore It s a novel idea but I wasn t interested in exploring that particular night They have a back patio that is often forgotten so in nice weather you have a better chance there than at Harris Grill Service is fine All in all it s one of my top picks for an average night out 
a9DjLjUlESPAC4ItZH-3VA CMU Excellent experience We went on a snowy Saturday evening with our 2 1 2 year old in tow Sat in a relatively uncrowded restaurant in a cozy and comfortable booth with an amazing view of the Cathedral of Learning Service and staff were attentive and accommodating Food was served fast Almost Arnie cocktail was delisch Farmbread and smoked wings were yummy Harvest pie and Margharita pizza were fantastic 2 y o also cleaned her plate of spaghetti Not overly expensive and a big thumbs up for being environmentally friendly We will definitely be back 
aGMQTKysm5QYeQiSzg_Eow CMU as expected dinner at ave b is definitely worth 5 stars the food as it was with brunch was amazing and i love that they have just as many specials each night as the permanent but seasonal menu service was also great and byob much more appreciated during dinner when bringing your own wine can be a great way to make a more expensive meal affordable i was also pleased to find out what tuna squared was a deconstructed spicy tuna roll and tuna sashimi annnnd it was really tasty 
AgvUCPaMPU1F3RCYrJX18Q CMU Pretty awesome place it is a cozy venue so if you re wanting to go here on a weekend it may be best to call in and make a reservation The food is fresh and the waiters are knowledgable and provide a formal dining experience without having a dress code if you re expecting huge portions of food i e more about quantity than quality this probably isn t the place to go if you are into enjoying your food because of the preparation and quality put into it this is the right fit for you I really enjoyed everything my date and I ordered I think this is one of the best dining experiences that Pittsburgh has to offer 
AHA_am4MuejupdRR85Qc5A CMU Food blah Pierogi with chipotle butter app was terrible frozen Mrs T s pierogi in PITTSBURGH is just lazy and they were drowning in greasy room temp aforementioned butter which carried heat with absolutely no flavor Everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality Main courses were a cuban sandwich and something I don t recall bad sign and were extremely disappointing Service argh It was late but if you re open you re open right Slow inattentive wrong sides which we couldn t correct given the service an they basically vacuumed around our feet 
aHLP08twjOmAmagMtnZZ-A CMU Came here for dinner on my birthday back before I turned 21 and also when my parents were in town for dinner The food was decent each time but nothing really standout I enjoyed my fish and chips but my boyfriend didn t care much for his pasta too rich and overwhelming I like the homey decor a lot though It really feels like a neighborhood place Coming from the suburbs I d never seen restaurants done like that except tacky imitations Luckily for students and other carfree residents it s on the 71C route and close to the 71A 
akSGxuGmA_Zfm5MS_0CuyQ CMU Great beer selection That however is really their only good point Service sucks is never prompt Kitchen staff is incompetent God forbid you should order food on a busy night When you complain to management they just ignore you That s what happens when daddy gives his 20 something kids a business to run I ve had issues there more than half the times I was there and the last 2 times I ended up walking out They ve had all the second chances they deserve 
aldNOjfCBK1yinujS9HuKA CMU Oh boy do I have mixed reviews Gather round children and lets dim the lights So I dine at Gullfity s every once in a while and they have an awesomely large menu to choose from and plenty of side dishes to boot One time I ordered a side of waffle fries with nothing on them Nothing No bacon no cheese nothing And low and behold the waiter brought it out to me flawlessly On a DIFFERENT occasion I asked for the same side order of waffle fries from an incompetant middle aged female waitress who just could NOT get the concept of plain waffle fries with nothing on them She JUST couldn t do it First she brought me out a full not side plate of loaded waffle fries I politely told her that this was not what I had ordered I thought that I had been very specific She then told me that the kitchen could not make what I asked for really and I continued to explain to her that I had ordered and received plain waffle fries in the past from this exact establishment Some people blow me away I wonder how they survive day to day life obstacles On the other hand Gullifty s desserts are AWESOME This is where the 4 stars come in I can never decide which dessert to get because they are all awesome I suggest getting something different than the person you are with and then share with them Trust me Kill a couple Gullifty s desserts with one stone if you can You won t regret it On the other other hand During the lovely 22 inch snowstorm of February 2010 my friend and I hiked up to Murray Avenue late one night to see what was open Gullifty s bar was open and we were welcomed inside We soon realized that we were the only patrons in the bar and the other 10 people sitting around socializing were staff members Before I knew what was happening they offered me another vodka lime we were smoking weed with them and it somehow became 2am T was awesome to say the least It was a nice escape from the blizzard and all of the other stupid stores bars that closed because of it Another reason for the 4 stars 
alJVklVeid35ibz5wndHow CMU I have to say that this place is a breath of fresh air for me I am a huge fan of the Asian fusion menu I have been there 6 times now and I have not been disappointed The Fire Beef Burrito is full of spice and flavor with a nice balance of vegatables Ask for avocado for that extra special touch I do have to say that my favorite dish is the Chicken Ramen or College Ramen on the menu The owner said that he used to make this recipe in college and has refined it since then but the flavors and spices are amazing The broth is rich and bold with a nice kick to it The stock is made from scratch which makes a huge difference The Pad Thai is also an outstanding choice The Wonton Soup is probably the best I have had in Pittsburgh I was pleasantly surprised to also learn that Aseoma serves Pho and it was quite good Overall I love the variety and originality that this place offers If someone is simply looking for General Tso Chicken with steamed rice than this place is probably not for you But if you are a fan of outside the box Asian cooking then make sure to stop in 
AnjiPHdHFZtgiZU6EXsibg CMU INCREDIBLE As an out of towner I looked to Yelp to provide me with restaurant recommendations for my weekend trip to Pittsburgh You did not disappoint with this little gem While the inside lacks much decor the food and service make up for that in leaps and bounds I made a reservation since the place is small Despite getting caught in traffic for 30 mins and thus being that late the staff held the table I d reserved for my boyfriend and me Their menu changes quite often monthly I think and I could not have been happier with our selections One of the highlights was the corn soup incredible robust and flavorful I ve never had anything like it My peach glazed pork chop was incredible as well as were the perfectly tender green beans and fluffy rice that came with it Despite being stuffed after dinner we ordered dessert and thank God for that We had the chocolate truffle cake and it was unreal melt in your mouth chocolaty goodness And it was smothered in homemade whipped cream We topped if off with delicious coffee served in individual strainers Stunning meal Wish I could transport this place to NYC 
aNm7IOUpSiiN3SDuThiIhA CMU A staple of the Walnut Street experience Walnut Grill has been around forever The menu changes regularly which is great because you can always try something new but is difficult if you are really digging a specific dish They always have great sandwiches and soups and the salads are always good Their balsamic vinaigrette is sweet and delish Went with Rachel C recently and had one of the regular menu items and one of my fav apps they have ever had spinach artichoke dip Large chunks of artichoke and a strong garlic flavor makes this the best spinach artichoke dip in town A must have when you visit Nice atmosphere good service at my last visit Stop hating on Walnut Grill 
aNysmLcYIJpLwtZprLILZQ CMU This place is fantastic It s a little bit difficult to find but that s why I would call it a hidden gem If you think it looks like a house it s because it had transformed between house and restaurant quite a few times in the past 100 years It s always good to have dinner in a place with some history As it s an old house I heard that some of it shakes when the trains come by a few stories below I d call it a quirk It was cool having dinner with a fireplace and some exposed brick I guess it felt like I was in a homely dining room because it was actually the dining room in the house For dinner I had an absolutely amazing mac and cheese with a fried egg on top and a slow roasted farm chicken with mashed cauliflower and fresh carrots Chicken was moist and tender but I really liked the slight bake they did right before serving to make the chicken skin crispy The wines suggested by the waiter were excellent and I even tried the two stouts that had on menu which made gave me that satisfied grin throughout the whole meal I was told the wine pairing on Tuesdays are ridiculous I hope to try it the next time I m in town I wouldn t be surprised if it d get messy with all wine mixing 
ANZklMSJ1_iydWLZg_a4og CMU where to start with houghs Great beer selection great food I would like a special menu with something not fried or dripping with grease but it s good bar food great atmosphere great service Every time we go here we are never disappointed At least one of the owners is there and extremely friendly I highly recommend the Chipotle Wings The specials are list in the menu and on the big board on the wall The beer specials are varied you depending on the night you can get a special on 22oz craft beers or the brewery of the month Also an important note even the bathrooms are clean i can t say enough good things about this place simply put you must experience Houghs for yourself 
AOgqr8-9iFJFl9W3-vnofg CMU I ve been to this restaurant twice and have been satisfied both times Great wine selction that rotates monthly friendly and knowledgable staff not to mention delicious food I inquired about a wine I had a year ago The host took my email researched which wine it was and contacted me a few days later with the answer I highly recommend this restaurant it s rare to find quality in both food and customer service 
As9baEmKiabcaNZv3e38Yw CMU MexiCoreanos Korean tacos should be amazing as they sound The marriage of Korean barbecue with the vibrant spicy flavors of Mexican food should be recognized and celebrated across the world So when I walked by here a month ago with my husband and we saw a new sign over the location formerly known as Chopsticks we got a test menu and completely lost it when we read the words Korean tacos Descriptions like Spicy marinated chicken french fries cheese pico de gallo grilled onions grilled tomatoes grilled jalepenos with garlic spread and spicy red pepper sauce caused tears of joy to well up in my eyes I think you know what s coming we were unfortunately let down The tacos weren t awful I enjoyed them quite a bit The meat was nicely marinated excellent grilled flavor and the spicy sauce was tasty but the filling tortilla ratios were off and the filling consisted only of the meat and the caramelized kimchi I think if they used smaller tortillas that d help balance the flavors out I felt the price was right however Only 3 25 for the fire meat bulgogi taco and 2 95 for the chicken or pork tacos We ordered all three and scarfed them down in a hurry Apparently to get the works you need to order the burrito I ordered the fire meat burrito to go during my second visit twice in one week yeah don t judge me because I was so curious but again it wasn t quite what I was expecting I got the fire meat burrito which is advertised to come with marinated beef short ribs french fries Korean slaw onions cilantro caramelized kimchi sesame oil vinaigrette with garlic spread but all I could taste was the meat and the rice which was Chinese takeout fried rice rather than Mexican rice Bummer I LOVE cilantro and onions but I could not taste that at all We did get to try the Black Bean noodles jjajang myun which I did enjoy but it s also pretty difficult to mess up Our favorite part of our meal was actually something called the sesame fried tofu It was fried tofu seasoned with garlic scallions ginger and sesame seeds topped with snow peas over a bed of rice The tofu was really nice and crisp sweet and savory Overall I think it s DEFINITELY worth a visit We will be visiting them again for sure especially to try some of their other pan Asian menu items or get the tacos to help us fend off hangovers I just hope they ll spruce up the tacos burritos with fresher flavors Maybe a little bit of lime more fresh cilantro and definitely Mexican rice 
AsDf-VRauaC9HdSm7ymoRA CMU I honestly didn t know a waffle could be this good You must try one but be warned that they are addictive You WILL want more So warm and chewy Go 
AsG6EDbQCZwD47vDhKxE8Q CMU As a Pitt student I was pretty much brainwashed to hate The Porch Eat n Park is going to build a restaurant in Schenley Plaza Gah I m not supporting THAT Well two years later I m sitting here on Yelp putting my foot in my mouth The Porch is a WONDERFUL addition to the Oakland restaurant scene Yes it sits on Schenley Plaza but just on the edge Yes it encroaches on one of Pitt s few green spaces but the architecture is so beautifully done that it fits right in Yes it is owned by Eat n Park but there are certainly no smiley cookies served here The menu has that trendy local organic homemade vibe but in a delicious way not a pretentious way I took my mom here when she was visiting for the weekend We decided to each get the featured soup pear and parsnip for our appetizer We then shared the Bianca fig jam goat cheese mozzarella arugula and Harvest Pie butternut squash leeks sage taleggio cheese pizzas It ended up being more than enough We took half of each pizza home Two Porch meals for the price of one I ll take it The inside of the restaurant is really pretty cool If you were to mix rustic chic simple and industrial in a blender you d get The Porch That s the only way I can think to describe it The whole time I felt like I couldn t possibly be in South Oakland It is probably important to note that The Porch is fairly expensive Our dinner for two came out to 37 before tip and we didn t order drinks But the next time I m in the mood to splurge on a great meal I m definitely coming back Pitt and CMU students This is a great place to take your parents when they come to visit Especially if they are paying 
aUP2LAnV3BKreodA6QrPFQ CMU Legume is the absolute best restaurant in Western Pennsylvania I dare anyone to prove me wrong Eclectic unpretentious and downright wholesome Legume always serves up the freshest dishes I frequent the restaurant at least once per month During this trip I had a platter of their pates including lamb head cheese pork terrine which was so good it was indecent I followed it up with the crispy pork belly and greens salad also insanely delicious then pineapple pound cake for dessert Every single bite tasted like heaven and I had to restrain myself from turning the lovely evening into food porn 
AuPh5lZn8hFvicy-0MYfcw CMU use to be a max and erma s and if that bar wasn t low enough it now misses the mark 
AwA8AjZiPyORk8tLDdJDKg CMU I have to start off by saying that I LIVE for build your own salads So I had nothing but pure delight when I heard about this place and their salad options I finally made my first visit last night and I was as happy as a clam Yes the salad bar is slight disorganized but the yumminess of the salad but up for any confusion I had in the salad line The apple cider vinaigrette is my new favorite dressing One of the people I was with got the American Grill Burger an Eat n Park favorite of mine and it looked extra good I personally can t wait to go back and take other people 
aW_5r4RdbXT76vUN9TKGWA CMU soft warm sweet absolutely delicious I tell almost everyone I meet that they must go to waffalonia to have a waffle if they haven t yet I would come to Squirrel Hill just for Waffalonia 
aXVuI-UY_XpHx0dSh3tH0A CMU Great food great service I have eaten at great restaurants all over the world and if I do say so myself I am an excellent judge You won t be disappointed This is one of my favorites in Pittsburgh Prices very good for what you get Steve 
A_LBGGaIx23iK1_4MAWOrg CMU First impression good food I want to go back try more of the sandwiches and pizzas A number of sandwiches sounded appealing to me and the pizza topped with arugula looked fantastic That s my next order 
B2G9W3lNaau1CtaFXQxW1w CMU This place is great Every time I m in town I go here for a few beers and a good time It s basically the Cheers of Pittsburgh This place used to be a really run down shady bar that was well known for the rough characters that would frequent it It was shut down by the city or maybe the previous owners left who knows and a new family The Hough s opened it back up after major renovations and improvements I cannot say enough about the family who runs the place Barb is amazing so nice and a great smile and the bartenders Kevin is the man The beer selection is incredible microbrews Belgian ales imports seasonals PA craft beers Likewise the specials run every day but Sunday and are great They just recently changed their food menu so make sure to take a look at that The most I have ever ordered was the grilled cheese sandwich AMAZING which comes with fries but I have seen more complex dishes that looked rather good for a bar Better yet the prices for food and drinks are all very reasonable the bathrooms are clean and the place is very comfortable no more hot humid bars for me one of the things I hate the most If you re looking for a friendly inexpensive and comfortable place to grab a few beers or maybe a bite to eat this is definitely the place to go They even have a board where they post pictures of all the regulars I mean how much better can you get PS If you want to play darts its super cheap check them out too 
b3GTyynBskBWqb-X0xiQQg CMU The Porch is a bar restaurant nestled between food huts in Schenley Plaza and a welcome one at that It s always nice to have new options in Oakland I have been here a few times and sampled the appetizers pizzas and several entrees I really enjoy the garden harvest salad which is topped with mushrooms and goat cheese Very tasty When it comes to entrees I have found that I like trying their daily specials when I can In early summer The Porch had a delicious baked meatball offering The red snapper is also very good My fish was perfectly cooked and served with clams and vegetables in a saffron broth For some reason I find the pizzas to be a bit bland even their more creative ones The bianca has an interesting pairing of fig and goat cheese but comes off a bit TOO sweet The pesto themed genovese is the opposite and is much too salty for my taste The dessert menu changes daily The chocolate bread pudding was delicious but the tiramisu wasn t as impressive There are nice little touches that make The Porch a great place to go First I like that they have a self serve water bar glass coolers with fresh herbs and citrus The Porch also has a porch I know you re shocked The outdoor patio and bar are the perfect place to have a casual drink and meal in the warmer months There is also a fireplace in case it gets a bit chilly As far as the bar goes there is a small but well chosen selection of seasonal beers on tap as well as a decent wine list A small warning however As The Porch attempts to use local ingredients the only whiskey they have is from Wigle in the Strip That s all well and good but Wigle is a bit of an acquired taste in my opinion It will not taste the same in mixed drinks as Jack or Johnny Overall the Porch is an excellent addition to the Oakland restaurant and bar scene The bartenders are just wonderful and so is the majority of the menu If they reassess their pizza offerings I may add the fifth star 
B5TwQEgfmIpBknAoNJCpNA CMU If you re in Squirrel Hill avoid the chains and head to the Murray Ave Grill Unassuming affordable and very cozy If I didn t live across the river in South Side I could easily see this becoming my neighborhood bar I wandered in here with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and had the most delicious black bean burger My friend highly recommends the Reuben as well she took half of hers home Next time I m in the neighborhood I m heading straight here 
B6CP1UNq8yUGDOwIftWSEA CMU I like that Red Oak is dedicated to organic food and eating healthy but the food is just hit or miss It really depends what you get I had a chicken wrap with hummus that was very lackluster but the blue plate specials are normally pretty solid The place is normally packed during lunch but if you want to eat well I think it is a solid choice 
b9YgARsHH9_69987-yJi8g CMU Extreemly dated on the inside the menu was pretty broad everything from lots of pasta selections lamb to duck to burgers and hotdogs We had great drinks appetizers salads and entrees 
BBcsKand8YAoF9YrLx0rFQ CMU This is the strangest place but I love it From the outside I would guess this place used to be a funeral home It s very strangely decorated on the inside The main dining room is a weird pink and green extremely dated and in the middle of the room there is this huge odd fake flower display That said the food is super yummy They give bunches of samples while you are waiting The wait staff is really nice I had the filet mignon and it was amazing Others at the table got different items and I tried a little bit of everything All very good The menu is really strange and like another said there is no theme But everything sounds good I have never been a huge fan of the Pittsburgh dining scene but I really like this place despite its odd decor Skip the faux fancy pants places and try this Oh and it s also very reasonably priced 
BbNyTDXowwiG5QH1KZHW3Q CMU I ve been here several times for Steelers games and other contests The place is spacious though you never know when it ll get crowded I ve been there on various game days when it was inexplicably empty Lots of wood panelling and you re never unable to see the many flat screens mounted around the restaurant Patrons do get nice and loud when the Steelers are playing Hough s calling card is their huge selection of beer Lots of beers on tap and you can get small samples to see which you like better The food is standard American bar food chicken fingers fries nachos etc The service is friendly and if anything gets messed up hey no one s perfect they re quick to try to correct the mistake 
bEaq-HmCNKPLesel1D-wTg CMU Amazing waffles Very authentic taste Extremely sweet and very tasty I met the people who started this place and the owner actually got the recipe from Beligium and is currently living there HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
BElQmb5qAtf1lpSuJhm5zw CMU It s hard to write coherently when the memory of this place keeps urging me to just shout AWESOME MORE and WAFFLES But I ll give it a shot Waffallonia produces by a wide margin the best waffle I ve ever had in Pittsburgh and one of the top 5 waffles I ve had in my entire life I d eat these waffles for breakfast I d eat them for lunch I d eat them for dessert I d eat them for a snack I d eat them out of boredom my doctor says I shouldn t do that but then again she s never had these waffles I d eat them in the rain I d eat them on a train I d eat them on boats and with goats and in boxes with foxes Look you get the idea They re delicious The menu is limited and seating is all but nonexistent but neither is likely to significantly affect my future patronage of this fine establishment 
bethvkOa0EmEtPkgcubruQ CMU went there for my 21st birthday with my boyfriend and I will definitely be back our waiter was extremely friendly had great suggestions for appetizers and dinner atmosphere was fantastic great for a romantc birthday dinner we had the shrimp and grits appetizer no wonder they re famous for it it was PHENOMENAL I had the pheasant for dinner and it was cooked perfectly couldnt have asked for a better birthday dinner 
BFmV-dwL7KziS347hYGSkQ CMU i LOVE this place I ve been going since they opened When they first opened you could tell they didn t really know what they wanted to be but they revamped the menu in the winter of 2012 and did a wonderful job I m from Southern VA and it makes me feel like I m back home not because of the food but because of the ambiance and warmth of the place Low lights Nice comforting food the duck salad is my favorite without huge portions and tons of oil to make you feel weighed down And the bourbon yes the bourbon Delicious food reasonable prices for the quality great atmosphere 
BFZewd0_jejNNOSKoAB57Q CMU The food here is generally fine but I ve had some startlingly bad service at times and was once served a medium rare hamburger that was so raw that it literally had white flecks of unmelted fat throughout And there s just nothing exciting on the menu at all Appetizers are generally good but expensive for what you get I would allow myself to be dragged here without protesting but I wouldn t choose to go 
BiFT-sVFcrRQxjuib19hqA CMU Legume is a small restaurant up in Regent Square that serves up extremely tasty food in a not so formal setting Their menu changes daily depending on ingredients the chef can get his hands on The chef is from Maine originally and thus is a stickler to high quality seafood the restaurant actually gets all their seafood shipped directly from the suppliers instead of through distributers I ve tried their duck confit and pate as appetizers I was originally surprised to see duck confit listed as it s not a dish I have run across in Pittsburgh ever if you know where I can get it let me know Both appetizers are definitely worth having again I ve tried their lamb chops perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium rare Their cassoulet is rich and hearty and perfect for the cold winter months The proteins they use are sausage pork and duck confit along with the beans of course The flavors were rich but it was a tad too salty for me and my palate already prefers the food I eat to be heavily seasoned They do take reservations now so that s always a good thing They re also BYOB 4 corkage And every now and then they have special events for special occasions so definitely be on the lookout for those as well 
Bj4ho62PKekzoDmt-11VCg CMU Another concept restaurant by the Eat n Park group see Porch However the latter is good and HB is bad The sandwiches are small overpriced and dry The salad bar while boasting an impressive 55 items is 1 not self service 2 not particularly inspired and 3 tastes like the stuff you d get at a regular crappy Eat n Park salad bar The only real Pro is the Boylan s soda fountain but it hardly justifies regular patronage 
bkabx6oZIjdEW8PjUSKBmg CMU Two stars for their overpriced predictable food Four stars for their awesome beer selection The outdoor seating is nice it s right on Murray Ave but somehow it doesn t feel like you re just breathing in exhaust fumes all night I used to live around the corner from this place and it was a really great place to go when I was feeling flush enough And it s so much better then the Cage or Silky s The food is technically upscale bar fare but half of the food tastes like they bought it from someone else that morning then reheated it for you Everything tastes a little dry and a little over processed 
bkTkRnAb7QT437UTXLM9Lg CMU The waffles here are spectacular Very close to the ones served in Belgium Highly recommend 
Bkyf2O4JHmVe8amxoTHNOg CMU I have never in my life dealt with such arrogant employees at any type of establishment I ve heard stories from friends and acquaintances about rude or lack of service and on one occasion I witnessed bartenders giving patrons attitude but always giving the benefit of the doubt I thought maybe it was a bad night or whatever Recently a few of my friends and i went for a couple of brews after work it was around 1am At 1 45 we ordered a round for last call but were informed that they already had last call Thats odd we were seated at the bar and none of us have a hearing impairment and it wasnt noisy When my friend mentioned that no one heard it we were verbally assaulted i wont go into detail it was a rather lengthy exchange and recounting that night is making my blood boil by the lovely female bartender She also informed us that they are closing early because we close when we want If you don t like it leave and dont come back we were told And then one of the awesome male bartenders finely spoke up only to call one of his paying customers a prick because he said fine We wont Yes this is how they treat they re consumers I dont care how many beers you boast no establishment in the service industry has a right to treat their customers in this manner Im ashamed to be the dutchess and i wont step foot in this place again They ve made it abundantly clear they dont care about returning customers 
BlbCg7xqDP3RbaVBjfs4Dw CMU Made a reservation for my boyfriend s birthday at Avenue B after reading a few Yelp reviews who suggested to do so The restaurant space is small but cozy and is also pretty quiet on a noise level basis so you re not shouting across the table Similar to Salt of the Earth they have their menus up on chalkboards however the chalkboard size and the fonts are smaller so we had a hard time reading especially since there was a glare from the light from where we were sitting it didn t seem very appropriate for us to get up and take a closer look since that might mean us intruding on someone else s dinner Good concept in theory I ordered the meatloaf which was good and my boyfriend ordered their special fish and chips and unfortunately everything came out tempura fried for him which was not what he was envisioning from the way it was described by the waiter And then because we were there for a celebration we ordered their smore dessert When we got the smores it was a deconstructed version which unfortunately was a miss for us on this too There were pieces of chocolate and we were suppose to drink or dip them into a chocolate liquid We were confused Needless to say we did not finish it Ultimately the choices we picked at Avenue B were either not mind blowing or memorable for all the wrong reasons I unfortunately don t think we ll be back given the prices we paid for our food though from what the other Yelpers are saying this would seem like a place right up our alley 
BlX8f1Tf-dQBM6mbFHaD6g CMU I took one look at their Speculoos ice cream and knew this was the place It does not get better than a Belgian waffle topped with Speculoos a Belgian spread made of crushed gingerbread cookies that in my opinion beats Nutella and any other I first had Speculoos on bread 2 months ago and loved the ice cream version at Waffallonia so much that I asked if they sell it Unfortunately they make it right in the shop and it is not for sale alone Nonetheless I highly recommend it Cute shop very local feel 
BMrm_mJBbjhuRK87bdRCwg CMU A great location for a restaurant right in Schenley Plaza and in wonderful proximity to the museums park library and the University of Pittsburgh I was a bit puzzled by the music which was a little louder than it should have been The food was very good We both got the prix fix selections and this turned out to be an excellent choice 
bN6IBDNMUPCJjCLRLY4GZw CMU I thoroughly enjoyed my self here The ambiance is casual the food was terrific I had a pasta I think it is called Charles Pasta but I m not sure It had so many wonderful ingredients Wonderful I had a great dessert pana cotta with strawberries with a vinegary sauce Don t worry it went beautifully with a candied basil leaf on top Very elegant for a casual restaurant They have a huge bar and an alcohol menu that is extensive The bar is separated from the restaurant by a 3 4 wall so the noise level was fine I ll be sure to eat there again 
BNz8uiglyypxes-Nj149eQ CMU Beer selection is unprecedented in Pittsburgh great draft list with about 50 60 beers a lot of great microbrews Food is so so at best 
Bohd102xOMjM2mJabXNVmA CMU Just get a plain waffle THEN get junk on a second one The plain waffle is how it is meant to be eaten These are great I am happy this place opened I drove all the way to NYC to eat this same waffle off a truck that drives around there NOW I am not pregnant AND i don t have to drive very far at all to get an authentic waffle Love the Pearl Sugar it is the sugary balls of goodness that make the not horribly sweet dough waffle POP with sweetness on and off during your chewing sensation We go here OFTEN for dessert TOO GOOD 
bPINSyz3iRqLyqFax2vmuQ CMU I m really impressed with the chef s ambition but not five starred by the follow through Four people in my group we all ordered the tasting menu and all got four different four course meals Some of the details were slightly off the rice risotto and black beans that were used as sides were either over or undercooked by a good ways Each course was delicious each wine pairing was great and I ll head back again Dessert wasn t included in the four courses budget another 5 for that Service was so so the waitress wasn t 100 on the wine list and it took awhile to get to the food after we ordered The entire room we were in had eight tables of which ours was the largest Call ahead for reservations Summary will eat there again 
bt9_Cl42YFEF1TToSmVyJw CMU This is a gem of a farm to table restaurant The menu changes at least in part because of what local producers are bringing in Really inventive cooking It has been in its new location only a couple of weeks and the restaurant is working hard to make things smooth It s quieter than the prior location no more pretty tin ceiling 2 valet parking across the street 
btiladO5hbi6wfez9M3wJQ CMU I ve been here three times and all have been great While I did find a couple dishes that needed a bit more work nearly all of the food was delicious well conceived and beautiful The Asian inspired dishes are consistently my favorite Don t miss out on their side dishes which are more complicated and flavorful than their simple description would lead you to believe We recently had a summer squash side dish which was one of the best dishes for the evening The deserts are also consistently amazing Considering the restaurant is BYOB you can have a fantastic meal out with wine without spending a fortune It s a bit expensive to go regularly but a perfect choice for a nice meal out every now and then 
Bv6Btdsc70z52XkTxBOimQ CMU AWESOME HANG OVER FOOD good drink prices and really good comfort food at great prices The service is cool Note that there is smoking inside so you ll either a love that information or b hate that information 
bvnlKSTMwbOzVwlUvOF8XQ CMU The pleasant surprise here is the anticipation of the chef hors d oeuvre which will be served On my recent visit it was buffalo deviled eggs I can t remember the last time I had deviled eggs so that was nice The highlight of my recent meal was one of the soups of the day the portobello mushroom was earthy and delicious Quirky decor and friendly service Lots of choices on the menu you are sure to find a delicious dish Love the crispy chocolate chip cookies they offer 
bwC0cC2AagY8XnCGnE_-CQ CMU Well I can t say that being around the corner from my house isn t a huge contributor to the fact that I ve been here about a dozen times since it opened I ve tried a lot of the menu and haven t had buyers remorse on a single dish have been super jealous of anyone who orders the spare ribs on top a heaping serving of mouth watering mac cheese I ve had more than a few bites and it s awesome The bbq pork eggrolls are my fave app as is the sandwich sampler My favorite thing though is a drink that has become a major craving during these sultry summer nights is the super refreshing frozen lemonades with bourbon and Framboise SO GOOD I highly recommend stopping in for a low key happy hour and grabbing one or two of those 
bY7oF2kYHGooNc-4RxNb9A CMU REALLY like this place Got lunch here did the soup and grilled cheese combo the soup was vegetarian chili see picture Both delicious When I first walked in the girl behind the counter was waiting patiently for my order so I explained it was my first time there and I might be a few minutes deciding Someone in the kitchen must have overheard me so he came over with a sample of their OTY pronounced O TEE and a pamphlet explaining Basically it s a warm oatmeal yogurt nut fruit and tea smoothie I think it definitely shows the character of a place when someone does that The OTY was very good as well Nothing like I ve ever had before Some people have mentioned that it s a little pricey I personally don t find so at all My soup and sandwich combo was only 7 50 Everything tasted SO fresh Tip parking can be a pain but it s worth driving in circles a few times 
BygN4Ak5u9tn-QvczmD8LQ CMU It s one of the few places on Forbes that is open late besides Eat N Park I used to live very nearby and came here several times in the last 2 years because it was general enough for people s tastes For tea late night hunger cravings dinner lunch dessert It s a good place if you don t want Eat N Park and people in the party are picky The food is sufficient Huge portions but I wouldn t say spectacular The menu has a huge assortment of choices ranging from Mexican to sandwiches to pasta Here I normally stick with what I consider safe options club sandwiches The desserts are great but incredibly small and pricey The cheesecake with strawberries is typical and satisfied my sweet tooth at least The kookie monster tastes as expected but if you re here to overindulge this is it Jazz on Wednesdays I believe gives the restaurant a nice ambience Don t expect to hold a conversation during that time however Service can be spotty depending on the day There have been a few occasions where no host greeted us and we ambled in looking for a table There was one time where the server ignored us for 30 minutes eventually we left In sum it s a good restaurant for what it is I wouldn t take people here to experience what Pittsburgh is or what good food is for that matter But if you need to be satisfied with slightly more style than Eat N Park then this is the place 
BZCDyHc9pOZhy595KzUNLA CMU Outstanding is a word I rarely use to describe a restaurant but Legume is deserving of such praise because it is just that good I hadn t dined at the first location but my wife had and she says good things We tried the new location one chilly and drizzly Friday evening and the place was buzzing Good sign Service was a bit shaky at first we seemed to have been forgotten but maybe it was because we were tucked away in a far corner of the room and the staff were still getting used to the space Fortunately service improved over the course of the evening We had a great meal Prior to moving to Pittsburgh we lived in France for two years slightly outside of Paris While the living in France experience wasn t all rainbows and unicorns joyous the food was of course great a lot of the time Many of the dishes we had at Legume reminded us of happy dinners we had enjoyed in France There was clearly a Gallic influence on the kitchen and what impressed us was the expert execution French food when done well means simple ingredients prepared perfectly or more complexity that is pulled off effortlessly This is what Legume s kitchen did We enjoyed the baked fetta reminded us of baked cheese courses in France duck confit beef and swordfish Everything was delicious and perfectly balanced and executed with apparent ease Dessert was less memorable honestly I don t remember apple something maybe Overall a great experience and really one of Pittsburgh s premier restaurants Oh and Jeff G s previous review mentioned parking The garage under the building across the street does valet With validation I think it was maybe 2 
c0g1WL8CHCFsify2rXS8ww CMU In a relatively short period of time Hough s has become Pittsburgh s premier bar for craft beer Think Sharp Edge but cheaper and less stuffy There are over 300 beers available and the drafts come in a variety of sizes for easy sampling Hough s also has regular specials on craft beer shout out for 2 off the double deuces which is a rarity in most bars 
C1fUml7Kxf9a_rtYBtitAw CMU I ve never had a bad experience at Gullifty s It s like stepping into a time machine and getting off with your parents in 1994 Their desserts are so good ESPECIALLY their bread pudding oh geez that is so good I mean this is really the sort of place you come to and get a big ole plate of mozzarella sticks french fries a burger and top it off with a chocolatey dessert It s a throwback party for your mouth I also love the decor 
C4iT8MvyuyY6Py66mzPF2A CMU Ambitious with poor execution The menu there is limited but I didn t mind that My hopes were that since they only did a couple of dishes they would do them well If only And maybe they could be better if they weren t using the exact same products as their parent restaurant Eat n Park I ordered the specialty pizza of the day butternut squash and was completely underwhelmed The dough was the same that EnP uses for their rolls the sauce was the same that is used for EnP s spaghetti sauce and the cheese was as bland as you could get Had there been a little bit more thought into the ingredients like higher quality cheese feta maybe and sauce that didn t come from a can it could ve worked Unfortunately they thought they could give you great ambiance and new presentation and you wouldn t notice that you just had diner food The most offensive part was the 10 that I paid for a pizza that was less impressive and substantially smaller than a 5 take out pizza that I could ve gotten around the corner 
C6Vsc8RTU4IxOptw6xl7JQ CMU I was skeptical of this place because I m not Eat N Park s biggest fan but the Partner In Cuisine and I were pleasantly surprised when we decided to saunter down to the Hello Bistro one warm Summer evening I usually try to avoid making lists like these but rather than write 5 paragraphs I thought I d give you the breakdown Good Fresh ingredients You can get any salad combination you can think of Eat there every day and you never have to eat the same thing twice Boylan Soda on fountan All you can drink Yes you read me correctly Not Pepsi Not Coke Boylan Amazing The fries are a little soggy but overall tasty Friendly staff so far anyway the place is too new for the employees to become jaded and miserable yet They actually serve beer and wine that s nice but I m not sure that it was necessary The chalkboard wall is a fun concept Not so good Cold proteins Some people like chilled chicken and other meats on their salads so this might not be as much of an issue but I prefer my chicken to be warmed up so it will melt the cheese just slightly The lunch rush is CRAZY and school hasn t even started yet I d hate to see how busy this place will get on a weekday afternoon once the college kids return Final verdict The PIC and I will definitely be back for an early dinner perhaps but we will definitely avoid lunching there on weekdays 
c9HqPO54V6xzERMsBgSKQg CMU Bourbon selection not so great Rye and scotch selection nonexistent Decor was bland and my bartender wasn t particularly friendly Oh and the peach iced tea cocktail kinda tasted sickly sweet like they used diet snapple On the plus side it was easy to get a seat Love the Devil s Cut It could also be called punchintheface in a good way 
C9KdlBjpfkzCBPqM7FTtQA CMU I blogged about this earlier this year and it deserved a proper placement on Yelp While Toast Kitchen and Wine might not have a lot of reviews sometimes the city s best kept secrets are wholly worth the struggle of street parking and unassuming storefront Don t let their horrible website or location on Baum confuse you this place was so quaint and well deserving of their several Pittsburgh s Best ratings Best Upcoming Chef Top 25 Restaurants and perhaps Most Romantic or something The boyfriend and I shared a couple apps the mac cheese and the foie gras Both were served with an unexpected twist the mac with a fried egg on top and the foie gras was almost blackened grilled Both options were so so delicious The foie gras was excellent especially to eat prepared in a completely different manner served with beans Delicious I had a salad while AB enjoyed his Onion Bisque which had crab in it so I couldn t taste for our second course The salad was prepared to my liking which included cranberries and walnuts with mixed greens but if you do not like a TON of dressing on your greens I would recommend not ordering this or even asking for less dressing if at all possible Again my preference is salads sopped in bleu cheese Oh it was so incredibly good Our entrees one upped our first two courses EASILY The menu had many great options in every different fish and meat category I selected the suckling pig and AB enjoyed the Mahi Mahi It was served similar to a cube of pork belly over steamed carrots and more beans this time white The pig also had a layer of crispy skin to it that totally enhanced the taste I was definitely too full to finish my plate and there was not even the tiniest bit of room for a dessert 
CcOYuI59CIM7ISAkS2lvdw CMU Red Oak is one of the few places in Oakland where it s possible to get healthy food The wraps and salads are great the food is locally sourced and organic and the atmosphere inside is rather cool It can get busy during the school year but they re actually rather quick 
cfCrQ18d2PGUPc6cl0op8A CMU My first time eating here was on Valentines Day with my wife I chose three stars but really I think more along the lines of 3 1 2 4 Atmosphere The bar area looked nice but I can t really speak to it all that much because we were seated upstairs I like the look of the place it feels like you are sittig in your own living room with the hardwood floors and the fire fire place The place throws me off a bit though though Toast is nice I would not really consider it a white table cloth kind of place and it doesn t really mesh with the the whole place at least in my opinion but I guess that is really neither here nor there The music playing is not what I expected as they place a lot more modern music which again throws me off with the white table cloths haha Drinks They have a nice wine selection not the best I ve seen but better than most of the restaurants I ve been to in the area Food Against my better judgement we started with the crab cake I did not like it at all the crab tasted off but I guess you ll get that when the crab isn t fresh What really matters here is the food and it is pretty darn good My wife had the Australian Barramundi with rock shrimp risotto and baby bok choy and the lobster sauce Though I didn t try the barramundi my wife thought it was very good and kept raving about the risotto I had the flat iron steak with potatos gratin hedgehod mushrooms and jus The steak was done to a perfect medium rare and was juicy and had greate flavor to it they got the steak right The gratin was okay nothing special and the portion was about the size of a couple spoonfuls My really only complaint that is if you are going to have three steak options on the menu why not make one of them more traditional at least of Valentines Day For desert we had to order two because two jumped off the page at us We ordered the peanutbutter ice cream sandwich and donut holes I won t go to far into these two dishes but they were damn good Overall this is the best meal I ve had in Pittsburgh Does that mean it will be the best down the road No and I hope not I was a little underwhelmed but I am not by any means saying I disliked the place I guess I was expecting too much I will most certainly go back at some point 
cGz4tDe7NUrcKXSyi4dNRw CMU Some friends invited us out to Shadyside on a Friday night and little did I know they had no reservations for the place they intended to take us I should have known that at 7pm on a Friday night an establishment that has no wait what so ever might be suspect Well I should have trusted my instincts No wait on a Friday night whats up with that Well this place was pretty weak in all areas The service was horrid and I felt that it wasn t worth the 18 gratuity that was already added to the bill I couldn t believe that from the time the appetizers came out to the time we received our food it took over 1 hour and to top it off no one acknowledged that it took so long I order the skillet cornbread appetizer which was ridiculously small and although it was tasty was by no means worth the 8 they charged for it It was simply a 2in by 2in piece of cornbread that had no sort of culinary twist put on it it was just that a boring piece of cornbread with some stupid garnish on top of it sorry that didn t make it any better people Then I ordered the cioppino which was a joke the sauce that contained the clams and mussels was about as bland as a sauce I have ever tasted and I even think the mussels were slightly under cooked and puny on top of it The special lady got the sauteed chicken which she said tasted really good but was a very unsatisfying small piece of chicken after waiting for over 1 HOUR I don t think I would come back here again even for a cocktail The price to quality and quantity ratio was way off too expensive for the mediocre food 
CjbUHKJlbGSoP-MdNiYLSg CMU Cute neighborhood restaurant Very fun that the menu changes daily They were very accommodating for me a vegetarian they have a veggie entree pre planned though it wasn t on the actual menu Pleasant atmosphere 
cKo8yvsbvPV8L4yvGQ_lag CMU Legume is one of the nicest restaurants in Oakland but it s obvious they re aware of that fact when setting the prices The food is good but not so amazing that one couldn t find a better meal for less money in another neighborhood That said the rotating menu makes it a little hard to rate as unsuccessful dishes can be quickly swapped out for other options This place has potential to be a great restaurant but it has a bit of a learning curve to get through first 
CL5Eo4KC8pBMu4w3u_8OQA CMU great food not much ambiance service was great 
CmVmZiXzGDQy2R9NjU113Q CMU I had spicy Mac Cheese with a fried egg Amazing And lamb meatballs with palenta decent Wine was good service a bit slow But I d definitely go back 
cnQIUg_r_1Syry23OBU8OQ CMU At this point we ve all been hammered over the head about seasonal ingredients nose to tail eating and the merits of being a locavore Watching celebrity chefs on TV remind us about the importance of using fresh local ingredients is beginning to border on insulting we get it And no we can t afford to get our fish overnighted from the Pacific But a place like Legume my favorite restaurant in 2010 reminds us all how important those things really are Legume manages the almost impossible balancing act of being ethically sound without being preachy If I were a much much better cook this is the kind of place I d want to run They source locally and pick sustainable ingredients for their dishes They can their own tomatoes during the summer since winter tomatoes are well terrible tasting There are a ton of little details like these in terms of how the back of the house is run that make me love this place If you re familiar with how Arrows ME approaches food this isn t too far off But let s say you love red snapper and Chilean sea bass and have no real interest in where your food is coming from all you care about is how it tastes It tastes amazingly good I ve eaten at Legume a number of times and I had to rack my brain to remember a single slight slip from the kitchen slightly slightly overdry meat and only once out of many visits Although the chef generally keeps safe options on the menu Chicken Under a Brick etc I strongly recommend giving the more unusual offerings a try Even the sides and addons are amazing Belle has developed an unhealthy addiction to their pickled haricot verts It s a fairly small place but has a fun hip atmosphere well suited to Regent Square And a final plug for their theme nights They offer a regular vegetarian menu as well as seasonally focused special events It may be something like offering lobster ravioli in fall yes lobster is seasonal or my personal favorite offal night Lots of places in Pittsburgh do excellent food Legume does that but also does really interesting obviously very personal food 
CnrZcAB921NNkT-SrcbK8g CMU I didn t find the food all that flavorable the service isn t great and it s definitely not worth the price 
cqA61UV5j7LQNVmviD0uow CMU Warning this is going to be a bit of a love letter I seriously love this place I love the dinner love the lunch and now have a whole new reason to love it Sunday brunch Those who know me know that I m obsessed with brunch and really wish I could have it every day Darn you work They just started doing Sunday brunch a few weeks ago and it s AWESOME I just ended up in the Burgh for a visit and I had a delicious dinner there Kevin the waiter is SO knowledgeable about food he is great and found out about brunch and had to have it before I left the city They don t take reservations right now for brunch and I had a sizable crew with me for the size of the restaurant so I called at 9 30am and Seth was SO nice to help me figure out a plan to have the best chance to set everyone seated around 11 30 We had no trouble getting seated but I fear that will change quickly as the word gets out about this amazing brunch Ok onto the most important part the FOOD OMG We started with some beignets that are a healthy portion 5 puffy fried pieces of deliciousness with a spoon of cinnamon sugar and an apple compote and a fresh berry compote kind of on the side whoa I licked my fingers On recommendation I got the eggs benedict which comes with thinly sliced asparagus and hearts of palm and is topped with a slice of mapley bacon that is insane The bacon is so good that you want eat a plate of just bacon and then another one and maybe another one whoa the hollandaise was heartstoppingly butterliciously good but JUST the right amount I hate it when there is a giant glop of it I want to be chasing it around my plate to get every bit of goodness not wiping it off on the side This also came with potatoes on the side which were like homefries but with some sweet potato mixed in and some red pepper They were delicious Boyfriend had the huevos rancheros which were hearty and delicious but could have had a little more spice for my taste Basically everyone loved their food but I was too absorbed in my own food to try bites and when I looked up everyone was licking their plates so I can only infer from that and their subsequent food comas that they were happy After I rolled back to PK A s darling wonderful host friends apartment for my own food coma I realized we forgot to pop out and get champagne for mimosas or bellinis Yes I forgot about brunch beverages Me One of the main reasons to love brunch This has NEVER happened to me before and that says a lot about the food the company and the experience in general and perhaps explains my love for brunch But seriously they do have the fixins for brunch beverages without the alcohol since it s BYOB by the glass or carafe I am seriously sad that I no longer live down the block from Ave B but I will be back for sure on my next visit to the Burgh 
CqLuJPF0dmsf43WHW6VB5A CMU The food here is actually damn good and while you can probably guess from the price you can t guess from the decor it s a tiny place and it s loud in there as it s hard walls and a hard ceiling with close together tables For what they re charging and the food they re serving it seems like generically they might be better served by a slightly larger location Plates are small entree portions are good portions of sides are about half of what I d normally expect I really like sides more than entrees so I was put off by the tiny plates of sides Would probably spend more and order an additional side on my next trip in I like eating food not just looking at it Only thing that really knocked it off of five stars was our waiter he seemed condescending to both of us although we didn t mention that to each other until it came up in conversation the next day You thought that guy was kind of uninterested and rude I did too 
cSpbNOw5aQaHlbpL7jpSPw CMU We got in a little late around 9 30pm so we decided to sit at the bar The food is the same some items are 50 from 9pm midnight and I think the bar looks much nicer The menu has lots of french influence and everything we order was amazing As apetizers we got the raclette The cheese was legit but the food wasn t hot enough by the time we got it they should use stone or metal dishes and they didn t serve potatoes with the raclette but that s fine they don t claim to be a french bistro the mushroom soup which was perfect For the main meal we got the halibut fish It was very tasty However I think the dish should have been served with more vegetables and the rice should probably have been placed on the side instead of underneath the fish the risotto was very good The carrot puree that came with it was also very good Finally we had the spanish coffee and truffle cake for desert both were really yummy Overall it s a great place to eat I heard the menu changes very often so your mileage might vary depending on when you go 
cWuqMdmTh7nCAkorQvKCAQ CMU Was super pissed about Beer selection Wouldn t call This place hip EVER b 
cx5vS2DoNYUJzZ-eZJSc8g CMU Had an amazing friendly quiet cozy fresh dinner here Very much looking forward to coming again but after going once I ll say its one of the best places I ve been in Pittsburgh Daily menu is limited and written on a chalk board above the dining room Looking forward to getting to know this place BYOB is a plus Servers are friendly and attentive 
c_In4MLF9zusEAGXNEmbSw CMU I ordered the Caesar salad to go The salad came out on a regular plate so I asked for a to go container The to go container given to me could fit maybe 1 2 the salad I m not sure why I was given a baby sized container for a full salad The menu also indicates House Toast is included it did not arrive on my plate Taste Overall the salad was ok Pro It was huge good enough for 2 meals Lots of chicken Con Lacked flavor More dressing would have been helpful About 1 2 the lettuce consisted of those middle of the lettuce head white crunchy flavorless pieces I also got the bottled Cranberry juice The brand they supply is appreciated all natural not loaded with sugars preservatives Service Girl taking my order was very friendly I did witness a slightly awkward interaction At ROC there are a few tables chairs outside There were a few restaurant patrons sitting at one of these tables Around 5 10 the wait staff went outside and asked the diners to leave so they could bring in the table chairs Closed at 5 00 Hmmm Of course I understand the restaurant wanting to close down as quickly as possible from a customer service perspective it seemed awkward Price About 10 for the salad and drink A little pricey for the quality but average compared to surrounding restaurants 
c_lkTYZKoCMJ3U2OcWJKNQ CMU Great service Ok food Delicious key lime pie I recently moved to Pittsburgh and I don t know if its just the east side of the country or just me but it seems every time I go out to eat I always get horrible service But this is my first restaurant experience in the burgh where the service was absolutely wonderful From the hostess to the server they were so friendly and did everything a person in the customer service business should do I wish I had something better to say about the food but the truth is I have had much better at worse restaurants But I ll definitely go back for desert and maybe try something else on the menu 
d-2hFI5P7oNzgdipYcBdwA CMU Their stroganoff is amazing They have different specials everyday so variety is good I go their every time I m in Pittsburgh doing hospital stuff since its about 10 minutes away from UPMC I had one occasion where the food was burnt but I said something and they immediately fixed it The atmosphere is warm and relaxing Like a candle lit The people are friendly and not overbearing or intimidating They know their menu and make it a goal to cater to everyone s dining needs I go here every time I come to pittsburgh 
D5du8XsRYusxpaRdfYAsOg CMU Ok this place must keep people coming by the ridiculous food portions that they have because the food itself is not so great It s just ok Nothing special Some of it is not good or undercooked such as a fellow diner s raw swordfish or mahi mahi that seemed more like tilapia Wine list just ok and very overpriced Dessert WAY too big of portions the brownie dessert was enough to feed at least 4 5 people and more the brownie was undercooked There is better food on Walnut I swear And even if there isn t go somewhere else Service is good which brings this back to a 3 star review 
D6_SictrllzZPLcpXa00wg CMU I love going to Cafe Sam for dinner All the people that work there are nice to me and others 
d7K018tusGXc7Fge89XKdw CMU I came here for a friend s graduation dinner Our reservation was pretty late 9p so by the time we were seated they were out of their limited specials We ended up ordering the chicken and halibut Both dishes were amazing The chicken was so juicy and the portion was massive The halibut was perfectly cooked too The service was friendly and quick If I am ever in Pittsburgh again I would come back Their menu changes daily and everything is fresh farm to table 
d9rJGJ8vi2HKh7kvjgSrIw CMU Not sure why it took me so long to review this place we ve been a dozen times and it improves each and every time Went for my birthday Pretty sure it was the owner waiting on me Seated right away got the corner bankette and it was so comfy And as usual the menu was exceptional I love that the menu changes whenever they re in the mood This month s menu had fried green tomatoes MMMM and then my personal favorite shrimp and grits And the menu always has such fun seasonal stuff Met the chef he s been there like 7 months yet the transition is seamless You d never know they changed chefs even Beverages diet soda I m so advenurous arrived within literally a minute in this beautiful balloon wine glass stem ware Great stemware Refilled it 3 times for me he was on top of it Even the ice water was perfect Food got the shrimp and grits SOOO good Brown butter and a touch of brown sugar with the PERFECT savory cheesey grits and the shrimp were sauteed to perfection Then the bread some kind of sea salty caraway crisp bread yet soft Perfect 10 on the bread Very important to me Then the entree hangar steak the medium rare was textbook sliced really nicely and some sort of marscapone cheesy grits type thing to go with and the vegetables were awesome Golden beets and ramps So good My wife s brussell sprouts were so good I had some and I hate brussells Go you ll love it 
dBe-mPFNI9x1TtTXqj7N2g CMU I have to preface this with I REALLY hope this isn t standard here because I LOVE WINE AND WINE BARS Although the atmosphere is pleasant and kinda sexy we did not have the best experience unfortunately We were seated upstairs in our own private room very nice and our waiter was real and pleasant We started with some wine and an appetizer which were both delicious Then a large party of about 8 people or so joined us in the private room fail Our waiter than politely took our order and about 7 minutes later took the order from the other party in the room We were enjoying the atmosphere but after about 25 minutes of being entree less we thought something was up The icing on the cake was that the large party received their entrees BEFORE us Another fail At this point I was pissed but in their defense both the waiter and the manager came up to us and told us that the kitchen had lost our ticket and were very apologetic Hmmmm Whatever bad things happen to good people Our main courses FINALLY arrived and were just OK We were then comped for champagne and dessert which was a nice gesture but the whole experience had unfortunately left a bad taste in my mouth I ll probably try it again simply because I love the idea of the place 
DDayz-76JGlA6BPOJ7yUXA CMU Upgrading to four stars Came here with my mom recently after seeing a movie at the Manor The Ten Pound Apple Pie looked absolutely tempting They call it Ten Pound because that s how much you gain after you eat it We went instead for the New York Style Cheesecake M m m m m All of their desserts are homemade and it sure shows 
dFuo7QuhMVm7yvMbTT3jeA CMU As it turns out this is pretty much my favorite restaurant in Squirrel Hill except for maybe Silk Elephant Everything here is good I have gone here dozens of times with many friends and we are always pleased Anything you order will be good They have large and varied salads The Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer is one of the best foods I have ever tasted They have plenty of vegetarian options Also the waitstaff well I can t get into it online seriously 
dG9LAic_efcjs_pFAx4-7Q CMU Stumbled on this place It s a small store with only a few bar stools to enjoy your delicious waffle so it s easy to miss Delicious Yep this ain t your ordinary Eggo waffle extra credit to the server who excused himself to wash his hands after he sneezed 
dh-ggH1Hf6UoQ8jXOfJVwg CMU Finally had a chance to return and took advantage of the Tuesday tasting menu with wine pairing Needless to say I was not disappointed As remembered the flavors were amazing and the service was absolutely perfect I will certainly be back hopefully sooner than later 
dhmPfA2cpHa8-gEmkcg1NA CMU This was one of my favorite places to eat lunch as a student at Pitt I wish there was a place this good near my work place All of the sandwiches and wraps are delicious and some of my favorites are the turkey mesquite and the grilled gouda and tomato The homemade chips are great and they have really good healthy sides for your sandwiches the green beans are the best I ve ever eaten The prices are really reasonable and the restaurant is clean and bright though a bit hectic at times I do wish they had more soup options though I ve never had the breakfast items but they have a large selection of breakfast foods on the menu 
diHp6lNUpDLy7OqwDZdnvQ CMU excerpt from full review http www rodzillareviews com 2011 03 legume html Legume isn t the type of place to go if you re looking to be seen searching for some off the wall ingredient pairings or the next inspired dish But if you re looking for a relaxed meal where you can be assured that the emphasis has been placed on the food they re definitely worth a visit The melding of traditional Italian French and American fare with a rotational menu brings just enough flare to keep the offerings exciting Quality food with quality service always deserves a recommendation 
DiRgmoUqtOdJfo1APAh_1Q CMU Quite possibly the most overrated restaurant I ever went to in Pittsburgh It was supposed to have some of the best desserts in town but I am simply not impressed The restaurant itself is ok for the food but nothing special For the price I always felt like I was a poor college student getting ripped off mind you in retrospect as a working man now it s not as bad but not as much as when I got the desserts Many times I entertained the notion that that they sell their desserts by reputation And maybe the reputation made me expect higher quality desserts for those average finales to dinners 
dMeVImShqmaC7fFSOvdjgA CMU Great little place in Schenley Plaza I m sure it will be even better once it cools off a bit and you can take advantage of the outdoor seating As others have noted service was a bit slow my draft beer came shortly after we ordered but my friend s coffee had to be requested halfway through the meal since it still hadn t shown up I had the pork sandwich which was pretty good If I go back I will definitely try one of the wood fired pizzas which looked delicious All in all it was good but not great I wouldn t hesitate to go back but there are other places in the Oakland Shadyside area that I would probably return to first 
DQvJcM-ZgM5CuuNx5XakSw CMU You can t beat the burgers here or any of their sandwiches and the beer wine selection is fantastic and constantly rotating Also you can t ask for faster or friendlier service I will definitely be frequenting the Murray Avenue Grill 
dRCl0Q8bR2wdt36o-ssdkA CMU Ahh the Squirrel Cage Many a shameful evening has started here This used to be my neighborhood bar and thus I have some ingrained loyalty but beyond that the drinks are cheap the bartenders are friendly and it kind of has that Cheers feeling everyone knows your name If you want anonymity and live in the Squirrel Hill area don t come here You will run into everyone and their mother and its not a place for a quiet drink The guy at the next bar stool will talk to you or the table next to you will invite you to join them on a Ritters trip Not much of a pick up bar thankfully but just a really friendly place Squirrel Cage is definitely not for the snobby or standoffish but if you want to meet some locals and are up for joining strangers on an adventure head over and grab a seat at the bar 
DsLu886RGVBQfb1Vl-yeXQ CMU The ambiance was relaxed and cozy The service was mediocre at best due to inexperience but they were friendly The food was O K but the amount of salt used was beyond excessive i cant recommend a restaurant where the Chef does not know how to season the food and you have to ask for more water at least twice i mean lets be serious water is free Has potential but needs work 
DWkv9p2BJTMjGPAOdvlwcg CMU I had a great mushroom swiss burger and they have some reasonable prices overwhelming beer selection 
DyPbm8muj_Dc172otEARFA CMU Finally a breath of fresh air in Oakland Great for college students because of both the value and quality of the food For a set price plus additional charges for meat you can get a delectable salad with endless ad ins They customize the salad even down to the size you want your bites to be Definitely a must try in Oakland there is nothing else like it 
DZt6vzkZ9v3-n5dM5vHVZA CMU I do not like going there because there is a lot of smoking in there I have been cancer free for six month now 
dzx4ssq8epOr8awPNZ2P2w CMU Went here for lunch on a weekday and this place was PACKED While the set up is kind of confusing the staff will gladly help you along if you look bewildered like I surely did I got the Crunchy Apple Almond salad It was OK I like the build your own salad concept but thought that the ingredients in this salad just werent special The chicken was a little too similar to what you d find on a salad at Wendy s Average salad although next time I ll be sure to build my own and get wild Serves me right for playing it safe my first time I also got a cup of the Tomato Basil soup It was just OK as well Very tomatoey with almost no basil flavor So a mediocre lunch place would be fine with me although I felt that the items were overpriced My lunch came to over 12 without a drink If I m spending that much I ll forgo the so so ingredients of Hello Bistro and stick with Oishii Bento or Nellies 
e1bXBJDlNbl608add6pZoA CMU This vegan gives a thumbs up Friendly staff over the phone and in person They modified a sandwich for me adding crispy seitan from the blue plate to a king kong wrap The king kong wrap with my added seitan was a texture and taste party in my mouth Wasabi peas crispy noodles and delicious seitan Sandwich name might be a bit oddly chosen though Only in town for a week from NYC but I have a feeling I ll be back The prices are reasonable staff is courteous and helpful and the food has impressive amounts of flavor and texture 
e44pC119NwIs59NjWEppuw CMU We came in here for after dinner drinks and although the ambiance was very focused on the basketball game going on we had a great time Notably the service is great and although we spilled one beer and broke a glass no we were not inebriated just excited and gesturing the waitress was lovely and accomodating Apparently they have great lobster and a yummy burger so that too would be fun to try 
e5j3ga6ML1rJ6DNG7cEtJA CMU First of all the service was outstanding I called earlier in the day when I was still trying to decide at which restaurant to eat and the waiter host on the phone was happy to describe to me in detail the appetizers and entrees that were on the board that evening I made our reservation then and there To me an indicator of a great restaurant is a menu that isn t standardized While they do have a small menu of appetizers entrees and desserts I think 3 each that are always available the majority of what they serve each evening is written on chalkboards on both sides of the restaurant We decided to go with an appetizer and entree from the year round menu and one each from the chalkboard Our starters were the butternut squash soup with green chilis from the board and the pear gorgonzola flatbread from the menu The soup was phenomenal It was smooth creamy and slightly sweet with the perfect amount of spice courtesy of the green chilis The seeds of the squash were roasted and added as a garnish Waste not want not Plus they were delicious and a great crunchy contrast to the perfectly pureed squash The pear and gorgonzola flat bread was good too but nothing spectacular When we go back I think I d probably skip it and try something a little more unique After reading fellow yelpers reviews I decided to go with the kobe meatloaf for my entree It didn t disappoint in any way The presentation was beautiful with the meatloaf set atop a mound of chive and goat cheese mashed potatoes I ll get to those in a minute and topped off with a generous helping of crispy fried onions The meatloaf itself was juicy and had great flavor The potatoes were fantastic a possible last meal on earth contender Potato chives is always a big hit with me and the addition of the goat cheese put it over the edge My mouth is watering just thinking about it The goat cheese wasn t overwhelming but there wasjust enough to make it recognizable Avenue B adds to the dilemma my husband and I face every time we visit Pittsburgh too many good places to eat and not enough meals to fit them all in Needless to say Avenue B has pushed itself to the top of the priority list I see an anniversary dinner here in our future 
EbfyGTXImNd5GalSGkGBPw CMU Don t Waste Your Time Went for Brunch and was so so let down by the super soggy underdone french toast and the greesy egg sandwich Managment really didn t know what to do and there are absolutly no substitutions Never ever ever go back COCO Cafe Lawerneville will destroy this place Pamela s Square Cafe Or Coco everytime 
eBhpNRXVGbhoXtJuOqlnMg CMU What was once the site of our beloved Dozen that has now turned into the Pittsburgh Cupcake Conglomerate I still love you now houses the newest and delicious dessert niche yet Waffles Yes WAFFLES I have had the distinct pleasure of enjoying waffles here three times since its opening Every time has been enjoyable and tasty The waffles are made with dough instead of batter which is unique to the traditional American waffle experience Nutella is excellent but for a real European treat try the Spekuloos a spiced flavor reminiscent of Christmas Waffallonia is themed like a train station complete with maps and minimal seating Seating is probably the only issue but frankly the space is so small there is little that can be done I hope to see this business expand in the future and the people of Pittsburgh expand their waffle horizon 
eCBUa5eV9YvztVQ0dn-jRg CMU We love this spot so much so that we had a private party here after our wedding last year Every single guest commented on the food multiple times Returned recently after many months of absence because of a move not because it isn t awesome and they had already realized we were coming in due to the reservation book they were so sweet and attentive and brought us complimentary vegetarian poutine amazingness Try this if you have a chance you ll be shocked it s meatless The place always has a very friendly easygoing and intimate vibe in our experience Our server was very helpful suggesting different food combinations so that we could squeeze in to our bellies everything we were craving I have now had chicken breast several ways there always crisp skin with juicy meat and great interesting flavors The Kobe meatloaf is always very good and the husband always enjoys the fish entrees he gravitates towards I don t think you can go wrong here it s just a matter of choosing what fits your tastes Have some fun with the creative sides and definitely DO NOT skip desert 
efkUmiJ09Y2CTAQeVqm75A CMU I really enjoyed the salad that I got at Hello Bistro today the ingredients were nice and fresh and there were tons of options to add to your salad It s a nice addition to the Oakland area lunch options and I think it was pretty reasonably priced for the size of the salads I also was a big fan of the Boylan Soda machine it s nice to have different selections for fountain drinks The only complaint I have was how crowded it seemed to be like there were too many people working all at once It was also hard for the staff to hear you as you ordered things to put in the salad but I ended up with everything on my salad that I wanted so I can t complain too much but I can imagine this problem only getting worse when all the students return to both Pitt and CMU 
EftmzBkE4njCtF6mXxb4lw CMU Their interpretation of mac and cheese was bland and greasy kind of gross The short rib entree was ok This seems like one of those restaurants where the food doesn t seem to live up to the wonderful descriptions on the menu It s a nice concept and I agree with a previous reviewer that the lack of TVs is refreshing I hope that s a trend that catches on with more restaurants Hopefully they can get the kinks out 
EGoyxwwz4iG9ljQXpmaqHg CMU Greenfield doesn t have a lot but what it does have is a little gem called Hough s As other reviewers have said the beer list does not disappoint The specials are fairly good and the staff is quite knowledgeable about the brews The burgers are the best of their food fare and don t get me wrong they are quite delicious however the rest of the food is standard and unimpressive If you re going to Hough s you re usually going for the atmosphere and the brews not so much to have fantastic food On the outside Hough s doesn t look impressive but inside it is quite spacious clean and has a nice atmosphere This is one of my favorite bars in the city to watch Penguins games Added bonus this bar has a kickin dartboard machine AND shuffleboard 
egXEBIxknKKOSK81QETtSQ CMU Tried it out on opening day they had lots of staff to help with the ordering process order when you come in then get a number and go sit down the entrees and prices were pretty good and the food was excellent especially the potatoes I think the price is a tiiiiny bit high for Oakland students but it was really tasty and worth it and they have a limited but great beer selection both local and regional beers as well Definitely a place I would come for lunch or an after work drink and it looks great as well 
eissO0q3hUbp6SPgxNQUgA CMU I met 2 friends for an early dinner last night We shared four of the 2 for 1 happy hour specials which was more than we expected The egg rolls were our favorite The menu selection was limited but included vegetarian options The wine and beer options were adequate We are all planning to return I heard their mac and cheese is superb 
ej3Pz6u1Ss8qUMsVRLNifA CMU Murray Avenue Grill is a rare gem It is a local restaurant whose owner Mark is on site most nights I was impressed when Mark remembered my name the second time I visited The clientele ranges from very young to very old They play 50 s music but not too loud The food is very good with a good range of entrees They have a full bar With your bill at the end of the meal you get two small Tootsie rolls How unique is that I love this place and will definitely visit again when visiting Pittsburgh I ve eaten there over a dozen times and the food and service are consistently very good They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more but I ve never had to wait for more than 20 minutes to be seated Also there may be open seats at the bar while waiting or you can eat at the bar 
ejGPYFjcZIGvMyNC3HLQyQ CMU I go here quite regularly mainly because of the good selection of food and micro beer The waiting staff and manager are really friendly and I have always received top notch service The wait can get pretty long during dinnertime especially on Friday and Saturday Overall though an excellent restaurant in the Squirrel Hill area 
Ejz4rfw_BoasHiIiimSp4Q CMU There s nothing to not like about this place Very pleasant atmosphere with views overlooking Schenley Plaza Great outdoor seating Fantastic salads with creative toppings Pizzas with enough flair to rival Dinette with slightly doughier crust if you care about that sort of thing It s a bit spendy for your average college student but an excellent choice if you are looking for something a bit classier than your normal joint in Oakland Good drinks too Also kid friendly 
eKjisIJ-wlLzWr4ZRA9KJw CMU I cannot believe this place only has three stars I have lived in Pitt for over a year and a half and this is the only place I have gone aside of Monterey Bay that I get excited to go back to The hummus platter is awesome I am addicted to the hot veg Sweet potato fries are great but they seem to run out a lot I have taken several friends there all have ordered sandwiches of different types and raved When you hear sandwich you may think lunch but they are upscale flavorful and creative Atmosphere is great upscale with a casual touch and the service has always been great 
EoYWq3tsglO0xBIVN0JVIw CMU I ve been to Pittsburgh twice and on my recent visit decided to check out the Squirrel Hill area I d been by there on my last visit and it looked like a good place for good food Just like NYC one of the biggest dilemas in Pittsburgh is deciding where to eat because there are so many good looking places Save yourself some time and arguing by taking my advice and come to the Murray Avenue Grill The fish here is excellent they use freshwater Atlantic Cod and give you a really big helping Our waitress was extremely friendly and the dining atmosphere was nice If I return to Pittsburgh which I hope to do because the city is absolutely amazing I ll definetely be eating here 
ER5NK0pEYPAs5UUrnpGi1Q CMU Avenue B is a fantastic addition to the Burgh s culinary scene Everything I had here app entree dessert was amazing The only negative is that the menu is pretty small about 5 8 app choices and maybe 7 entree options This place is not for picky eaters This is a place where I suggest throwing caution to the wind whatever you order is going to be great 
ERHvw1xJzXvTPg6ZnT_7Xg CMU First impression Totally ooh la la romantical inside I felt like I was meeting a french lover and we would sit closely and feed each other croissants I was in fact not meeting my french lover but some fab yelpers for a new dining experience They did not feed me anything but I did enjoy some good food and great company Being good little foodies we had researched the menu thanks Serena and decided to go with the food pairing Our waiter was little to no help in actually describing any of the menu items we would receive or up selling the extra 20 wine pairing Strike one We decided to not do the wine tasting and just choose 2 half glasses It was really interesting how they break down the wine servings You can buy a 2oz 4oz 8oz and bottle I actually like that because it encourages you to try different wines you may not be familiar with Or be too scared to try and not like for fear of blowing 10 a glass Strike two came as we sat there for a good 20 minutes after our food was ordered waiting for our waiter to come back and ask us what our wine selection would be hint to business people who drink spend more money so hurry it up We actually had NO clue what kind of food we would receive for the tasting Not a good choice for a picky eater I applaud those who aren t and get annoyed at those who are sorry folks The first course came and it looked as if two people received one dish and two people received another I had the angel hair crab pasta It was an interesting dish to start with but it was a strong start food wise because the white cream sauce was really tasty The next dish was trout with greens or it at least looked like that I could barely understand the food runner as he literally ran away It was OK Nothing memorable literally because it s the one dish I struggled to remember as I thought back at the four dishes Third dish was the spinach salad with goat cheese and blueberry vinaigrette dressing I love when restaurants have interesting salad choices A simple salad is just that simple You can add flavor literally to any salad with an array of toppings and dressings I really enjoyed the uniqueness of this one My last dish was quail with risotto and spinach Greens were obviously in high quantity in the kitchen tonight I actually thought this was the best dish It surprised me because I m usually not a fan of chicken dishes It was really tender and flavorful with a ginger reduction sauce I also liked the risotto and spinach mix The sauce made it really rich and flavorful as well Where s strike three you ask Well we waited FOREVER for everything Water wine meals Bueller Bueller The saving grace was that someone server food runner manager busboy no clue came out and apologized for the slow service and told us desserts would be on the house If you know me you know a desert can fill a lot of voids in my life Maybe even bad service We received a peanut butter ice cream sandwich YUM balsamic ice cream DOUBLE YUM surprisingly rhubarb pie Ew too tart and lemon pie Ew too sweet The only one on the table left almost in tact was the rhubarb pie Tasting menu s are usually the way to go when you re at a new restaurant and want to sample a bunch of different items I almost feel like I may have been better off choosing one item mac n cheese I m looking at you So yes I ll be back Soon Not so sure And I ll for sure be a one meal kinda woman French lover style 
eV6mlyt1abLH37GSM2lS6g CMU Dave Andy s ice cream Nutella Strawberries fresh bananas Warm chewy waffles that are like funnel cake Just go I don t know what the hell you re doing reading this 
eyI_r5cJDiNjCIxGtvurPA CMU Initially I was skeptical The exterior does NOT do this bar justice I expected a tight dingy Silky esque inside It was bright open uncrowded and comfortable The beer list is phenomenal and inexpensive for the selection The darts are FREE which is tremendous The shuffleboard table is short but that s OK Hough s is a Man s world the only women in the bar are 1 2 of the waitstaff and ladies there accompanying their boys Not a problem for the happily involved but not the scene for the scoping This is my new favorite bar in which to sit and talk to friends 
Ezczk7YZCHHfhKsCKrk1hw CMU Earlier this week a friend recommended the Antwerp a glorious Waffallonia waffle crowned with your choice of ice cream get the speculoos and chocolate sauce I have since been here twice I have ordered the Antwerp twice Every bite is divine Divine TELL ME HOW YOU DO IT WAFFLE MAKING DOOHICKEY because every Belgian waffle you ve birthed is equally perfect with a crispy carmelized sugar exterior and warm doughy innards And while not at all necessary the speculoos ice cream adds a rare and wonderful Biscoff flavored goodness Seating is terrible I don t care 
EZE75SmOpmTzbBLJ0qVp9A CMU Too bad when I was just in Pittsburgh in May and July I missed going to Gullifty s I do like the place but since I live in FL I can t give you folks any current update Suffice it to say it s still standing on Murray Avenue I walked past it just a few weeks ago but alas though do not pity me I d already eaten a wonderful lunch at the Shadyside Pamela s Anyway Gullifty s has provided tasty food for me and whoever my dining companions have been over the years my cousin my good friend my husband and daughters I don t recall anyone of them remarking their food was bad I just need to move back to Pittsburgh for about a month or two at least then make sure I visit this place again So sorry for this vague and mediocre review But I felt I should chime in with my comments since there are several negative reviews here 
E_JoPCZz-q2HYj9cy8iTcA CMU After some research we decided on this place for my birthday dinner The restaurant was on my yelp radar but I didn t know where it was who knew it was tucked on the corner next to the market district well I am guessing most people actually The place is cozy with only about 10 tables The menu is compiled of the rotating chalkboard menu and the staple menu Both menus were intriguing the gorgonzola flat bread peeked my attention for an app We also started with the calamari Both apps were delish and devoured quickly I ordered the tofu noodle bowl which isn t a regular choice for me I don t eat red meat or pork but there weren t too many kate friendly options The entree was good don t get me wrong The table enjoyed their veal fish and chips hanger steak Pros Cozy BYOB rotating specials BYOB BYOB delish food Cons Service was not memorable parking not many kate friendly options ha Pros We definitely be back 
e_NEQ2VxWacSyjl2uSBWMg CMU What a great surprise I had a hearty tasty chicken and broccoli soup with ham excellent My husband had his usual bacon cheeseburger and the fries were his degree of perfectly crisp My cheese turkey and Granny Smith apple sandwich with honey mustard sauce was served on a hearty multi grain bread and grilled lightly most satisfying especially since I brought half home for another meal Cayla our waitress was appropriately attentive without being overbearing We will definitely return 
F4d83rjTwHtyYt2TNWPMFg CMU We made reservations for a friday night It was packed but our table was ready and waiting We brought our own wine too The staff was really nice and helpful The Kohlrabi and feta salads were very tasty but quite small The pork shoulder tasted like a pork shoulder it could have used some more seasoning or chutney or something The lamb steak was perfect I would definitely go here again It was a little pricey but completely worth it 
fe7TsOjriSxySuf0-fjArw CMU Good bar burgers and very friendly service Guy at the bar is really good at remembering who you are making this place have a very comfortable hangout atmosphere Salads are just kind of okay but it is a smallish and not so expensive bar so that s to be expected Good selection of beer Sports games are often on when I ve been The place has a very Pittsburgh feel Sometimes seating gets crowded 
ff4yQYWOBp_ns-RBJL8PIQ CMU Taste like Belgium waffles to me Comparable to NYC Waffle and Dinges with more flavors of ice cream to choose from I loved their pumpkin spread and pumpkin ice cream Very tasty could use more fruit toppings but I m happy with what I got for sure 
ffbtsgbDoOApq707q0Tp4Q CMU Attention all my Food Hounds out there Ole Brim here to tell you about a phenomenal new place right in the center of Schenley Park in Pittsburgh right across the way from the University of Pittsburgh The Porch at Schenley What an amazing place the ambiance is astounding sporting custom blown glass light fixtures scattered custom artwork by local artists an outdoor fireplace and HUGE open windows One major bar raiser for this special spot is that they are a VERY green company They are very focused on keeping their product as fresh as possible SO much in fact that they have constructed a full spice herb and vegetable garden on the roof of the establishment We were informed that their plan for 2013 includes adding a Honey box to their roof garden did I mention that they ll be bringing in between 50 to 60 THOUSAND Honey Bees to get this project started The Porch gets even MORE impressive as our visit continued they again GROW all their own herbs spices and veggies all the bread and jams are made in house all the pickling and brining are done in house and their meat is ground in house daily I m starting to wonder if there is anything they don t do here Furthermore these guys have only been open for SIX months So again the Hounds were in full effect with Luscious Mina Sanwald Etan Wish myself and our special guest Jose Hernandez Jr ready to take this location by storm Getting down to the nitty gritty of all the foodie love packed into every dish in this place EVERYTHING is rich in flavor but non fattening In fact the chef goes to great lengths to ensure that all his platters are not only quality but also low in fat by utilizing the best cuts of fresh meat that he butchers himself right down to the specific oils used to fry their signature Crispy Taters whole Yukon potatoes slightly crushed and fried whole with rosemary sage and sea salt after being boiled in a super secret blend of herbs and spices These suckers are ridiculous I could eat these things all day every day and then some Crispy and bursting with flavor that could only be enhanced with the use of the house ketchup curry another brainchild of the crew at Porch These babies are SO good that they actually go through 800lbs of Yukon potatoes a week Moving right along with the appetizers appropriately named This That The Cast Iron Cornbread was served in a cast iron pan light salty buttery taste with a slight sweetness within the crunchy top Their Smoked Wings were off the hook crispy with a dry rub of sea salt pepper and some other goodies accompanied by a trio of saucy goodness Bleu Cheese BBQ and Buffalo The KC Style BBQ Spare Ribs blew our minds I ve crossed the path of many different ribs but these fall off the bone ribs were BOSS the WIN for all of us in terms of the starters They are smoked lightly for a few hours for the Smokey flavor and basted with special seasonings and sauce that make the tastebuds go POP Entrees Ahoy We all legitimately thought we died and went to Heaven The cuisine was as Hernandez said four syllables Re Dic u Lous The Grilled Rib eye was hands down incredible A wealthy and healthy cut of prime meat cooked to perfection slightly seasoned just enough to still enjoy the natural flavoring of the steak We are Meat a tarians hear us roar It comes with more of those you my Crispy Taters and this fantasmic Salsa Verde I enjoyed the Piggie Pie Personal Pizza made in their brick oven with a mixture of their house cured meats Copa and Porchetta and Rosemary parmesan and hot pepper on the side Being that I only scratched the surface witness the variety of pizza they have I would recommend any pizza lover or aficionado to visit Monday thru Friday from 9 30pm to closing when ALL the pies are half price The Roast Beef sandwich was well portioned and nuzzled by two slabs of Farm Bread covered in a Vermont Cheddar blanket with Herb and Roasted Garlic Aioli and Olives The good old fashioned no holds barred Beef Burger was hearty and would satisfy the likes of most people YAY More Crispy Taters Another dish we didn t expect to find on this awesome menu was the Cast Iron Lasagna rich hearty cheeeeesssey A carousel of flavor their housemade chive pasta engulfed in Beef Bolognese and Bechamel sauce dripping with scrumptious Mozzarella A spotlight really deserves to be given to the Rotisserie selection that we sampled the Duck Legs were very well presented had fall off the bone tender and savory meat with a Blueberry Champagne Sauce Then there was the Chicken Roti words can not describe how succulent this former feathered friend was As much as I can describe how awesomely amazing The Porch is it is nothing compared to seeing for yourself Fast friendly and knowledgeable staff great meals and great deals this is surely NOT a spot to miss while in town 
ffXCued5Ey-mFLpjaZfh_A CMU INCREDIBLE Three words Waffle with Speculoos Simply amazing 
Fgx2hmBaso0R55mBdrdq_w CMU If you re looking for very good food at very reasonable prices in an excellent and quaint atmosphere look no further than Toast Oh excuse me I meant Toast We enjoyed their 4 course tasting menu and on Tuesday it was only 30 I m not sure you could find a much better bargain in Pittsburgh It wasn t a pre fixe menu it was just whatever came out of the kitchen So on the one hand I was a bit disappointed to not have tried the touted shrimp and grits or bone marrow On the other hand each diner gets something different so it was a great way to sample the food Oh yeah the wine comes in a half glass 4 oz as well as full pours It s just another great way to sample their wine menu The food was very very good I wasn t blown away with the flavors but there was some creativity which came off well One of the last dishes was basically pulled pork terrine It was great And again I think there is great value here for 18 to 22 entrees vs the 25 to 32 at others such as Casbah or Spoon Lastly the environment is fantastic It s set in a house so there are multiple small rooms It s cozy romantic dark and all with a nice indie music playlist setting the tone I m looking forward to another visit 
Fhwk52v0Pd2DXEAt8G4iEg CMU This restaurant was inconsistent and C grade before it moved to Walnut St and it s even worse now Food is D grade if you re fortunate enough to get it at all the service is so slow and inexpert that it s like nobody there has ever worked in the restaurant business before I m actually nervous about eating there because the food is often undercooked and vegetarian dishes are cooked right alongside meat dishes you can taste it even in the salads which are pretty much gross and never fresh Max Erma s the former restaurant in this location wasn t gourmet but it was consistent and tasty This is junk Been there twice and will never ever ever go back If the owner offered us free food for life we d still pay to eat elsewhere 
FiVv5RMfIDUa1MQrUNoOmA CMU Selection of beer hands down 5 stars I went to pick up what I thought was the food menu and realized it was a beer menu ummm AWESOME The food menu was smaller in size this is how you know they mean beer business Also I expected it to be a lot smaller inside but it was huge And it was done up real sleek inside not ultra modern more like casual modern but you can tell it s gotten a face lift recently When I had initially gotten there on a Friday around 6 PM it wasn t that crowded but fast forward to about 8 PM and every seat was filled bar and tables I had the Benko Burger and I d have to give it 2 3 stars I wasn t that impressed b c although the accessories aka toppings were delish the burger meat itself was gritty and chewy so I didn t finish it I will say that the food is very affordable I think the burger was 7 00 and it came with fries But if no when I go back I ll probably stay away from the burgers I had a nut brown ale and a wheat beer and although I can t remember the breweries they were great I think I had the Franziskaner Wheat In any case I think you really can t go wrong since they have so much of a selection If you truly are a beer fan you should definitely check out Hough s 
FlFXZbhmuPNKCTUbEWneXA CMU What s not to like about the Squirrel Cage It s not a theme bar you ll not find any cheesy decor or anything fancy that matter It s simply a great neighborhood place As other posters say it s a place to have good cheap greasy food and a beer okay so I m primarily a non drinker It s a great place to people watch too because here you see people as they really are They come here and they act like themselves and aren t putting on an act like at some lame club 
FoUO5kuWDr8zekk6rfPHzQ CMU This is inside the Carnegie Art Museum but outside the paid area Although very crowded it was surprisingly quick Order at a counter pick up your drink pay and they bring the meal to your table Small menu light stuff but fast and good I had a cajun shrimp salad the daily special that day crunchy lettuce decorated with the medium sized well spiced shrimp Definitely a satisfying light meal 
FpjrZCRIUZbB8tmRQT-o9g CMU Without a doubt the best restaurant in Pittsburgh While the location leaves a bit to be desired the moment you walk into Toast you will feel like you re a thousand miles away The food is fantastic with frequent menu updates but there are some mainstays that are hard to pass up most notably the shrimp and harbenero cheddar grits The suckling pig is also fantastic and is surprising in its plating Toast also lives up to its billing as a wine bar with a great selection and many reasonably priced wines from which to choose The ambience is very cozy both in the downstairs bar and the upstairs seating area My wife and I have been to Toast many times and consider it one of our mainstays in the Pittsburgh area If you haven t been you re simply missing out 
Fp_FFh_p4a1zHXnkN--IUg CMU Avenue is a cute bistro esque set restaurant with a chalkboard menu of specials The wait staff is so on top of their game too I had the kobe meatloaf which was delicious 
fQADAAfiUMEqKXVRWF7tbQ CMU Delicious and healthy food just like your momma s 
fQbBjQcGyDbnGIcGRCOHVw CMU Made my first visit to Hough s last night for trivia night reubens Will definitely absolutely no questions asked return for the reubens Chunks of homemade corned beef excellent bread The beer selection is also really impressive something for every palate Wish they weren t the opposite side of town from where we live but those sandwiches are worth the trip 
fQi6mspaFU9VGQ3JNmD2cg CMU About 8 years ago my wife and I travelled to Bruges in Belgium with our wonderful friends from London and our 8 month old son We had a wonderful time and brought back with us a love of many things Belgian 1 Fries the Belgians are brilliant at fries and as a sign of good fortune a few years ago Point Brugge opened up in Point Breeze and catered to our cravings 2 Beer the Sharp Edge has been around for long enough that we have never felt a deficit on this one 3 Chocolate Chocolate Moose and Eureka and others have made sure that we have access to the really good stuff But Number 4 True Belgian Waffles have been denied to us UNTIL NOW Real Belgian Waffles are NOTHING like their Eggo kin or even like the waffle press stuff that we can find at breakfast buffets all over These waffles are not just pancake batter thrown into a waffle iron This is thrice leavened sweet dough with pearlized sugar that results in a layered waffle that is both delicate and chewy in texture As I sat in this very cute very tiny space I saw a number of folks pass I assume based on the 3 price for a basic waffle This is only because they know not what they miss For one thing the best and I apologize the the good proprietors of Waffalonia if this hurts revenue way to eat these waffles is straight up and plain they are sweet on their own with no accouterments You take them wrapped in a napkin paper and you can walk around Squirrel Hill tempting everyone that you pass with their aroma This is pretty much the way it works in Belgium at least in Bruges The ice cream toppings Nutella etc are great but not really critical although as long as the toppings allow you to walk around afterwords pile em on The point is that these waffles are designed not as breakfast treats but sweet treats that you can walk the lovely eclectic shops of Squirrel Hill with too bad they are not in Shadyside These are not your mom s waffles unless you came from Belgium and your mom had a special waffle press access to the right type of sugar and the patience to let her waffle batter rise three times in order to create the perfect waffle If all of that applies I humbly stand corrected 
fr5PiNcbEKG7sqEQzPT5rg CMU The first time I set foot in Gullifty s I was scouting for an apartment in the Squirrel Hill area It was a Saturday at lunch time The place was crowded but the customers looked like they were eating there out of habit rather than out of culinary choice The floor was sticky There were tacky posters The food was kind of bad The restaurant made me wonder if I picked the right place to live Fast forward a couple of years I learned that you go to Gullifty s for desserts after movies not Saturday brunch But i remained skeptical how good could the dessert be when the entrance greets you with a rotating cake display But in an effort to acclimate to the local culture I gave the restaurant a couple more tries The crowd at night were mostly young people too busy having a good time to pay attention to what they re eating The desserts were big and sugary nothing extraordinary One positive change the tacky posters were gone and the floor was less sticky Fast forward yet a few more years I finally come to appreciate what Gullifty s has to offer they open late for Squirrel Hill and they do a passable job if the dish is simple So on some cold winter night when you suddenly have a hankering for a burger after 10pm Gullifty s is there for you maybe w some live jazz 
fRZE9BLO1cNvqKEs6NdW6w CMU I ve been here a couple of times both in the bar and in the dining room The bar is cozy and warm the cocktails were delicious and service is great We ate at the bar once when we showed up without a reservation on a busy night and it didn t detract at all from the experience The dining room is clean and modern but the smaller divisions keep it from being too cold Food is amazing The menu changes daily I love it when a chef does that Keeps them and us on our toes If you don t want to be surprised when you arrive you can see the menu online by 5pm each evening I just looked at tonight s menu and I m considering heading out there last minute Totally drool worthy It s a good thing I don t live too close 
FvevT0rlTfazjlTVIK76HA CMU Without a doubt one of the best meals I ve had in Pittsburgh After planning to go here for about 3 months my girlfriend surprised me with reservations last night for our 3 month aversary yah we re adorable I know And both of us were blown away Let s start at the beginning The decor is just right Small rooms on the second floor with dark wood and exposed brick They even use dark red blinds to slightly lighten the room with the sun coming through them but not so much to spoil the mood If you need a romantic spot you ve found it as long as you don t mind schlepping up a steep set of stairs to get there On to the service Our waiter was fantastic Timely knowledgeable and friendly I asked him to write down the wines we were having more on this below and he was kind enough to give us a copy of the wine list and write in the wines that were off menu Fantastic And most importantly the delicious food On Tuesdays Toast offers a 4 course tasting menu no dessert that varies not just by the day but by the person My girlfriend and I both went this route and had 8 actually 9 with the dessert dishes to try between the two of us And let me tell you they were all fantastic Unfortunately because it was dark this is not a bad thing none of my photos came out damn iPhone and it s lack of flash but I m happy to describe everything First Course I had the beets goat cheese I think and something else salad FANTASTIC My girlfriend had the spinach and egg salad An interesting dish where 2 fried eggs sat atop a bed of spinach I never would have guessed that that would be a good mix but boy was it ever Second Course I had the mac cheese bacon I m not a mac cheese guy but this was fantastic The bacon flavor permeated throughout the dish and the pasta was cooked to perfection My girlfriend had the shrimp and pasts i think they were raviolis but I forget and it was also great The shrimp something I can only eat in small quantities due to an allergy was perfectly cooks and she reported that it was a great dish Third Course I had a fresh water fish from the great lakes forget the name on a bed of black beans and it was very tasty probably the worst dish but that s really not an insult My girlfriend however had a trout I think that was exceptional The skin was crunchy and the meat was soft and tender It had a wonderful flavor to it and was probably my favorite dish of the night Fourth Course On to meat We both had beef but with different sauces her s sweater than mine Mine was accented with green beans and potatoes Sounds boring right Well that s what I thought but boy was I wrong The green beans were seasoned perfectly and I wish I had more Overall both dishes were perfectly cooked I hope you like your beef medium rare with an emphasis on the rare and the presentations was great Dessert We were pretty full at this point so we split one dessert We wanted the backed local peaches but they were out so we opted for the French Toast It was good Not great but tasty The problem is that the first 4 courses were so perfect that the dessert feel a little flat As for the wine the parings for 15 person were fantastic Each wine was exceptional on its own and even better with it s accompanied dish Unfortunately that list I mentioned earlier is currently with my girlfriend As soon as I get it back I ll update this post If you are looking for a romantic upscale and yet reasonably priced under 100 for the two of us meal look no further Toast lives up the the expectations we put on it 
FWHPo26t-jT8xxZN_Sgztg CMU Came with my mother and tried the tasting menu Excellent service good food The food was generally well prepared the pork chop was particularly well executed and the wine pairings were well thought out However one thing that sort of bothered me was that for the party of two we each received a different tasting The idea of getting two tasting meals at a time is certainly admirable and definitely possible with their portions but sort of takes away from the more holistic aims that I generally hope to have in a tasting menu I also thought some of the flavors in the tasting menu didn t quite work great together and did not really seem to build on each other That said all of the dishes were good on their own although the mussels were not fantastic 
FzG4IBQ-EU7IfQunHI42CQ CMU Let me preface this review by noting that I am a part time private chef very much involved in the cuisine of both Thomas Keller and Eric Ripert I prefer food which focuses on the ingredient in it s most pure form That being said maybe this was not the place for me to dine Taking into account though the positive reviews menu and location of the restaraunt I thought this might be a positive dining experience The service was wonderful but the food left a lot to be desired I found the style and description of the menu to be both misleading and inaccurate Nothing really came out on the plate the way it was described The food in particular was extremely over salted almost to the point of being inedible The quality of the ingredient was average at best The plating was clustered busy and very sloppy Flavors were very disjointed and lacked balance I would have rather had dinner at the Whole Foods salad bar I wish I could find a positive note to make me come back for a second try but I just can t find one The food was just not good in fact it was pretty gross 
FZPYkjDky2OiZbnK0pUj6Q CMU Oh My God Ah mazing Avenue B is amazing Being in Pittsburgh for the past 6 years I would say that Avenue B is by far the best and most inventive meal I ve had in the steel city besides Umi of course Located on Centre Avenue the location is a bit strange and in the middle of nowhere ok Giant Eagle but who cares but the food is so good I ve been there for brunch and dinner on a few occasions and I would have to say that the dishes I got were perfect For my most recent meal I got the gorgonzola flatbread and the sweet potato pot pie Sounds pretty ordinary right WRONG The flatbread was warm and was sweet and tart from the pears and blue cheese while the pot pie was so comforting yet decadent and flavorful It was the perfect meal I would most definitely recommend Avenue B for a great but expensive date Make sure to make reservations ahead of time they are booked any day of the week 
g-1bwcJRUyzrGgUtU1tywA CMU This place has a good amount of reviews so I won t say much I got a hamburger somewhat against my better judgement due to all the great stuff on the menu and asked for medium rare What I got was almost revoltingly rare It had a delicious crust to it so I know it saw some time on the grill but the center was almost cold and by the time I finished it was decidedly cold I like some red to my meat but there were parts of it that were absurdly raw and not at all pleasant I ve had problems getting medium rare in Pittsburgh including Brgr and Burgatory who seem to only do well done but this chef seems to under cook I pointed it out to my waitress although I did not send it back because it was really really delicious and she said they had received similar complaints before In fact they guy behind me was complaining to his wife that his came out medium instead of well done I m sure they use good beef and have high safety standards but I genuinely felt like I might get sick from the burger when I was eating it this did not happen To drive the point home IT IS LIKELY THEY WILL UNDER COOK YOUR BURGER I don t want to come off as libelous but from my experience the guy next to me and the waitress this is something that happens with some regularity That said the burger was outstanding The toppings were delicious the bun was grilled for crust the salad on the side was a great slightly bitter accompaniment that was perfectly dressed and their mixed pickle was sooo good It was a very well balanced meal each flavor complemented each other well and each element was well made Maybe I m being harsh with the 3 stars especially since I could ve taken it back but when you charge the prices they do a diner should not have to worry about something so amateur as under cooked meat If you like rare burgers or order something else this place is probably great 
g-W2_Z3NGtSRzYRKeKFuhQ CMU The Food They got a new chef for 2012 and he has an insufferably and inaccurately high opinion of his own culinary skills The menu went upscale as did the prices but mistakes and questionable decisions were virtually omnipresent The burgers are small and dwarfed by a comically large and not particularly well chosen bun The seafood soup bread bowl is disappointingly bland The mac and cheese is chewy and quite deficient in cheese And one of my fellow diners was served raw pork In a party of 6 people not one would even consider going back for dinner The Drinks Awesome if and only if you like bourbon That s really the only reason to go 
g3ZvHMpJQWuVu03HGkLWvg CMU Friendly service and vegetarian friendly options I had the Michaelangelo breakfast sandwich with a side of grilled veggies different veggie each day and another breakfast sandwich on the other day and all was delicious One clerk tried to interest me in the OTY a oatmeal and tea concoction with a sample It tasted good but the texture wasn t my thing 
G49MFFCAZYCS8Px-XYIFrQ CMU We were really disappointed with our food here I went in November so I don t remember details about service and atmosphere but the one thing I remember vividly was how NOT good the burgers were First they switched mine and my mom s I like mine rarer than Mom so since the waitress mixed them up I was chewing on her more well done and subsequently dry burger until we figured out there d been a switch But even her burger supposedly medium rare couldn t save the overall taste The patties seemed to be nothing more than ground beef flavorless no hint of spices or anything And dry not nearly juicy enough It s a shame because we live so nearby and could easily go here often if it was any good The specials on the chalkboard outside always sound enticing but I just shake my head and think it isn t worth trying It s probably worse than it sounds 
G5X-NHyvLn5vWq4Yzi9RZw CMU Oh legume you are forgiven for leaving me I know now that I have not been forsaken I just have to drive to see you now What once was an extremely tiny neighborhood joint with aspirations that could not be contained in its diminutive space is now a vast elegant but not overbearing restaurant in the city s academic center There is little charming about N Craig St so like others I was highly skeptical of the move Thankfully for the food scene in Pittsburgh Trevett and Sarah are savvier business folk than us Regent Square homers The new space is open subdued and pleasantly quiet I would like to see them get some more art up in the section where we were seated the creamy walls were entirely blank I was very happy to find the same lovely warm staff ever maintaining a wonderful balance between friendly familiarity and fabulous professionalism Service is usually only mentioned in the negative and it worth taking a second to really give legume kudos for collecting cultivating and keeping a truly remarkable knowledgeable and pleasant staff who clearly care about the food they serve and making sure that you enjoy it I had been to legume s former location a number of times and this has been a consistent experience Then there is the reason so many of us became loyal visitors to the itsy bitsy bistro on S Braddock Ave the food Oh my oh my Trevett Hooper and the kitchen staff of legume love food and it shows Like many other Pittsburgh restaurants isn t it awesome that I can write that they seek out locally sourced vegetables meat and cheeses so the ingredients are fresh and of very high quality Ingredients are combined in creative mouthwatering dishes and perfectly executed This particular evening I was taking my mother out for an early birthday celebration I was glad when she chose the lobster ravioli with chives and parsnip puree 29 as I knew she would love it and she did I was also impressed that instead of going for the boring cream sauce option the chef instead used the lobster stock to cook down a reduction with which the fresh pasta wrapped raviolis were glazed I started out with the curly endive salad with blue cheese mustard vinaigrette pear and candied walnuts 9 The endive was not bitter at all and the flavors played beautifully off each other The salad came dressed but it was perfect flavorful but no dressing puddle on the bottom of the plate Mom had the rutabaga pear soup with pancetta and croutons which I totally would have ordered if it were vegetarian She claimed that it was well balanced with the pear s mild sweetness brightening up the earthy rutabaga If you like meat and care about the animals from which they come legume should quickly earn a regular spot in your restaurant rotation On the other hand if you are a vegetarian like me you will also find much to love at Legume The veg options are always more limited but 1 they re always well thought out and creative 2 the servers understand what vegetarian means and will direct you appropriately e g when going over the dessert menu Jason let me know that the pound cake had lard in it 3 They re always willing to work with you If you are vegan or have other dietary restrictions they ask that you give them a call in advance and they ll do their best to work something up for you And 4 Most important they are delicious I had the crispy spelt with sweet potatoes pureed mushrooms house made ricotta shaker dry roasted corn and sweet and sour cabbage 18 I wasn t entirely sure what I was getting myself into but was not disappointed when I took my first bite Artfully arranged in layers and topped with a crispy spelt cracker the flavors blended perfectly with each bite the lightly sweet sweet potato savory mushroom lightly rich ricotta and the sweet tart bite from the cabbage were delightful I finished off dinner with the warm gingerbread topped with poached quince and whipped cream If you are a fan of dark molasses gingerbread I give this a hearty thumbs up My mom opted despite being too full for the toasted pound cake with vanilla ice cream poached kumquats and caramel sauce She said it was delicious but could have done with a bit more caramel sauce Based on visual observation I would agree however it should be noted that moms could drink a mug of caramel sauce I have been quite remiss in reviewing the places I ve dined recently so the fact that I took a menu with me w permission to ensure that I would not forget anything in my review should be an indication of how much I enjoyed my experience PS A note on cost I marked the place as spendy because it is but the entree prices are very reasonable both for size and quality Obviously you aren t going to get Cheesecake Factory portions here thank goodness but you ll definitely have enough to eat 
GaFqCeeFG7vzxu6jF-pz3A CMU I ate at Avenue B in Pittsburgh during a visit back in July Chef Chris Bonfili really puts forth some creative and tasty cuisine sourcing seasonal ingredients from local farms for his menu which changes daily My girlfriends took me here and we ordered shared many different dishes and they were all delicious Kobe Meatloaf goat cheese chive whipped Potatoes with Crispy Shallots and tomato jam Heirloom Tomato asparagus salad with a roasted garlic vinaigrette Black Grouper black eyed peas greens candied bacon sweet potato hay berry BBQ Crispy Eggplant Tagalini Pomodoro Pittsburgh better savor this gem of a restaurant that could easily rival my favorites here in San Francisco I look forward to eating here again when I m back over the holidays YUM PS BYOB 
GfRZDzc4BOAkY_3rNWEyhg CMU The old Elbow Room on Ellsworth in Shadyside with its crayons and butcher paper mismatched furniture crowded homestyle sloppiness is gone forever In its relocated reincarnation in the former Max and Erma s space in the nearby Walnut Avenue shopping street the new Elbow Room seems like an entirely different restaurant The decor is tasteful and understated with dark paneling warm dark walls and high ceilings the bar area is positively gigantic and looks like a comfortable slightly upscale spot for a reverse happy hour in Elbow Room parlance cheap drinks at the end of the evening 9 11pm and the service is friendly meticulous and a darn site better dressed than on Ellsworth We had Sunday afternoon salads or salad bowls I had the Grilled Trout Salad with a lemon horseradish vinaigrette the Trout was crispy and the dressing was subtle and refreshing and my wife had the Crab and Asparagus Salad with red peppers and a lemon red pepper dressing she said it was perfect On the bev front the Elbow Room seems to going all out to win over the wine crowd and meanwhile has a pretty impressive selection of beers on draft including a B2 signature IPA and the whimsically named Fleur de Lehigh you know in case you haven t gotten your minimum weekly requirement of cardamom flavored beer 
GGAuLH76OeBa7YMN5CPwLA CMU When I visited walnut grill in shadyside the service was very good however the only problem I had was when I ordered a ribeye steak sandwich and the server informed me that this can only be cooked one way The sandwich was good I just don t understand how u can only cook a steak one way Decent beer selection but would probably not go back 
ghExYJbbIDoIjW2NWDrErg CMU Up just opened in the space that formerly housed Walnut Grill and is just what Walnut Street has been missing The decor is simple and crisp but not sterile white washed brick walls complemented by cozy leather seating along the walls The cuisine follows suit As he had at Pangea Chef DeLuca really lets natural flavors shine with uncomplicated though still interesting preparations Our skillet cornbread was moist light filled with corn and sat on top of perfectly proportioned layer of creamy corn bisque My husband s duck confit was earthy and rich without being too heavy For our mains we both got fish as we never met a piece of seafood we didn t like at Pangea I had the halibut which was cooked perfectly sat on a bed of risotto made with squid ink one of the better flavors I have tasted and was also accompanied by bright and fresh broccolini The flavors were excellent together My husband had the pintado fish which was similarly well executed The only miss was a Caesar salad which sounded quite a bit more interesting on the menu Of course most people don t order a Caesar wanting anything all that groundbreaking Perhaps most impressive was the service especially given that it was the first night that Up was open to the public Our server was very well informed about the menu she checked in at appropriate times to see whether we were enjoying our meals and to refresh our beverages and the courses were very well timed I have never gone to a restaurant in its first week and had service as good One of the owners also visited and asked us our thoughts on the menu pricing etc He didn t push too much we were clearly engaged All in all a great experience and I will certainly be back 
GhV9NvVw2Zyllq1Sd58kzA CMU Perfect pub food Servings are much larger than you d expect so don t over order Great beer selection Very friendly fast service 
GiOoJ5MotrtHYGFqkn96TQ CMU Thursday night girls dinner where to go Luckily I had just grabbed the City Paper s Dining Guide and I realized there are a lot of places in the city I haven t been yet although it feels like I ve been to all of them We had a place picked out but because the weather was so beautiful yesterday we decided to switch gears and find a place where we could sit outside and enjoy the nice evening I found The Porch at Schenley and it was a perfect spot I can t believe I hadn t been here yet We sat out on the porch and the atmosphere was great people everywhere and you were able to people watch in Schenley Plaza It s such a great laid back place The food was also amazing I had an Almost Arnie which was limoncello iced tea and mint It was so good and refreshing not too heavy We ordered the rustic bread salad which was deelish a free iron skillet corn bread that I received a coupon for in my email and that was amazing and then I had the Garden Vegetable burger It was served with a side of potatoes Everything was above average for sure I can t wait to go back It would be a great place for just drinks and appetizers too 
GJEbsmSnNqEQ6bJjC8VmoQ CMU I ve had pretty good experiences dining here but maybe that s because other people were paying for my food about half of those times The service was fine and I liked the decor I also enjoyed the food although if I recall correctly there was entirely too much of it As a carless resident of Pittsburgh I love the great location on Walnut Street I don t have to go out of my way to dine here since there are plenty of stores to visit 
gJS3pl4X_LSoIXZBylTEvQ CMU This is my new favorite restaurant it was Point Brugge for quite some time Went here on a Wednesday for the vegetarian tasting menu Warm crusty bread to start followed by excellent cream of mushroom soup The next dish was goat cheese crostini with hot pepper jelly Not my favorite but the goat cheese was great Main course was crispy faro with ricotta cheese corn mushrooms and tomato pesto It was perfectly prepared and sized 4 corkage fee was reasonable The desserts sounded great but I was stuffed Love the close bustling atmosphere Servers were attentive but not annoying Looking forward to trying the rest of the vegetarian menu Pros Fresh local ingredients great service great atmosphere Cons My dining partner felt it was a little pricey for the serving sizes but I was satisfied I highly suggest making a reservation At 8PM on a Wednesday the small restaurant was full 
glAb0hX1KQMeAxw6HhLiaA CMU Very nice place relaxed but classy Prices are on the high side and food is good but not amazing 
GMb7K7SNFQv7iZoeiGgIQA CMU Great place Excellent food the owners do a lot of work finding great produce and top quality meat and fish They prefer locally sourced ingredients as long as they re delicious They ve experimented with smoking their own meats They also develop relationships with local farms we recently attended the second annual Jamison Lamb theme dinner which included a presentation from the farmer about raising delicious lamb The menu changes daily and usually includes a fish entree a beef or pork entree and at least one vegetarian entree They have no problem with alterations and substitutions and if they run out of something they ll probably improvise something even better The chef owner and his staff are very skilled at making things that taste subtly amazing The dressing on the field greens salad kind of tastes like lemon and kind of like vinegar but I just can t figure out how it tastes that good The first summer they opened I ordered a fish dish served cold on lettuce with hard boiled egg and pickled beets just like a perfect retro picnic lunch One night even I asked them why their butter tasted so much better than my butter at home The menu can get adventurous in a retro euro rustic kind of way One winter they offered roast marrow bones so of course we had to order them You scooped the oily delicious marrow out of the leg bones and spread it on toast it was fatty and delicious and totally worth the calories and labor Desserts are great too frequently there s a silky panna cotta with fresh seasonal fruit a dense bittersweet chocolate torte and a perfect fruit crumble They do take reservations now have for the past several months You can request a reservation online from their website I m a little bummed about it because now they re busy all the time and we can t just walk down the street and get on the list The place is small and can get a bit noisy if you re worried about that go early or late 5ish or 9ish when it isn t full Also it s BYOB which in my book means you can bring a wine you like and it won t cost you 30 extra 3 bottle corking fee Prices are on the high side but deservedly so Entrees can range from about 16 to 40 depending on ingredients and appetizers run maybe another 7 11 But I d pay the same at any good restaurant like Eleven or Dish or Soba Oh for a few months in spring 2009 they re trying Sunday brunch some great things have showed up on that menu so far not sure if they will make this a full time offering 
Gn0cB7XMnpohjmGS3LZOAw CMU Aseoma has fast become one of my favorite places to eat on Murray Their menu is both extensive and interesting and everything I ve ordered so far has been very good Prices are quite reasonable portions are large and food quality is high with lots of fresh meats and vegetables Some of my favorites are The black bean noodles their version of zhajiangmian with wonderfully chewy wheat noodles and a nice thick black bean sauce which is not overly salty as some zhajiangmian can be I agree with other reviewers that their Pad Thai is the best in town with thin sliced chicken thinner than you re thinking shrimp a hint of shallots and a tasty sliced green vegetable not quite sure what it was but it was good The addition of a bit of vegetables to the Pad Thai is not typical but brilliant it provides the dish with wonderful balance to it s typical sweet tangy sauce Their Korean fusion burritos are pretty cool as well and are perfect for when you re not as hungry Having bulgogi style beef in a taco is quite simply awesome and it s balanced well with rice fruit and slightly spicy sauce 
GNcaJiuFb65Ps9Fh8Yvyzg CMU my husband and I went there for dinner this evening and while their bunches are usually lovely I don t think we will return for a dinner meal again I ordered the steak mid rare and asked for a Caesar salad for my side the salad was terrible bland the dressing was barely there and i really question if it was actually a caesar dressing The parmesan cheese tasted old and well sorta like it had been shaved off the block of cheese ages ago it was sort of rubbery and bland as well My steak was more medium than mid rare and they included a peppercorn sauce which sounded good on the menu but had far too many peppercorns in it and ruined the dish the mashed potatoes were really good once i picked out the peppercorn overload seeping into it The broccoli served on the side was barely steamed and seasoned with some surprising and awful seasoning Completely disappointing My husband s salad looked much more appetizing baby field greens and ranch dressing he was happy He asked for a shrimp alfredo which they did make special for him they have it as chicken alfredo on the menu I tasted the sauce and it was ok but very thin and could have used more cheese to add more flavor as well as thicken it He was happy with the meal but admitted to me that Girasole s alfredo was much much better So no I don t see us heading back anytime soon for anything other than perhaps a bunch meal I will say that the service was excellent the waitstaff was attentive and friendly and they did a great job but the food is overpriced for the quality of preparation 
GnKkj7hBgHgApWZR5y2HWQ CMU Been here a few times now and I m thoroughly happy there s finally a decent place with great atmosphere and great food within walking distance from CMU I think the beautiful venue is half the reason I visit the Porch The interior is spacious and sleek while the outdoor seating area is great for those sunny days and nice nights they have a fireplace outside The food is great Been here for dinner and happy hour Great happy hour deals and great food for dinner I recommend the Duck Legs Burgers Bianca Pizza Crispy Taters and also listen to what specials they have that night because last time we got their beef shank dish and it was amazing People need to stop going to Union Grill and come to the Porch Similar prices but WAY better food and ambiance not to mention service 
gnPzJ3pOocaTKQSUSFQylQ CMU The atmosphere is nice at Legume It is an older building that has been update to look like a modern restaurant The food was delicious I had a grilled salad that was wonderful as a started For my main course I had a Wahoo dish The fish was cooked perfectly and some of the odd and different sides worked perfectly in the dish The only complaint that I had at Legume was that it was quite warm in the restaurant I think the correct phrase is freakin hottttt but even with the heat I gave the place 5 stars since the food was so good 
GoxTMg_75IHuqb32xqyhiw CMU I m thinking my expectations may be too high While this location couldn t be better the atmosphere is casual and contemporary and I liked ordering at the counter for lunch my food was just bleh My friend and I had the garden harvest salad for 11 and literally had two mushrooms two slices of roast beets a couple 2inch pieces of asparagus and a bit of cheese and walnuts Oh yes a handful of spring greens too I ve had dinner salads that were larger No protein on the plate I thought the salad was going to be huge loaded with the above mentioned veggies Huge disappointment If you go don t get a salad The pizza looked as if you would be getting your money s worth Try that I could have really gone for one of the gyros being sold right outside 
GTCk2rjD9xGtQPnlQChE2A CMU Went at 7 45 pm on a Sat PM and they had already sold out of three items on the menu When the menu only has about 10 items on it I call that pretty poor planning Salads were fine Entrees were good but fish portions were so tiny we wondered if they were running out of the ingredients and cutting portions in half Our entrees were the size of small plate portions We are used to eating contemporary cuisine and don t expect Big Boy portions but it was truly shameful to charge 24 for this portion of fish It should have been a 15 small plate Decor is nice and simple Love the size of the restaurant Love that the place is not pretentious Still I would not go back 
Gu30meXXDncLpucxvTBT_Q CMU Excellent food and great atmosphere 
GU5fMGvXZuZP1qDCr69Nzw CMU Lots of room hazy memories but the service must have been good Had a blast Extra star for allowing smoking 
GzBQe4a05OD0purti2pymA CMU This place has really great chili and their salads are good too The service is always friendly and although it used to be really smokey I have heard it is now smoke free 
H-FC4SE4BtsDC6WJIJwxIQ CMU I swung by here in the middle of a long day of apartment hunting It wasn t very crowded There appears to be an adjoining bar area not sure if it s the same restaurant or not it s quite small but contains several comfortable looking booths and TVs Anyways I was there for lunch The service was decent we were tended to by several friendly employees and the manager came out to see how we were doing complimenting my father on his choice of Malt Vinegar to accompany his fish and chips The food was good but probably not worth as much as we paid For the life of me I can t remember if they had any good beer on tap I think I drank like forty glasses of water instead But I m sure they ve got something acceptable I can see myself coming back but probably not as a mid afternoon pit stop like I did It s probably more lively at night 
-1fCWRFoZ69sqOYiPb6yeA CMU I had brunch with my sister here a couple of days ago and the food was scrumptious I had a mozzarela sandwich with roasted tomatoes and peppers And my sister had an eggs benedict 
-7F14FbLo-LKy2MlqEp9KA CMU Stopped by this place for a drink because I was in the area and the place looked inviting Great move the staff was very friendly and welcoming Happy hour was awesome not to mention it was lobster night yummy Live music open air friendly faces good drinks and pretty good food Go for it 
-Bi_c6qJ9MvzymhyS4e6Bg CMU the live music was awesome but don t sit too close to the stage or you won t hear your party the food was scrumptious and the drinks were made to perfection the crowd was young diverse and professional i can t say enough about this place 
-cwMBp-Fr2FiSRcfpwML3A CMU this place is pretty cool granted i didnt try any of the food but the ambiance is great they have a solid beer selection as well as some nightly specials this place is a very solid spot to come to and this is when it was cold out they have a fairly large outdoor area for seating and im sure during the spring summer times its pretty bumping i hope to try this place out again most definitely 
-dwIaF5_Nl9IML4mFg57GA CMU Great little bistro in the middle of Columbia area The hostess was efficient and promptly seated us It was interesting that the restaurant ran out of scallops so for their Cioppino entree they are just going to drop them For 28 5 you d think they d offer to adjust That said ordered the pork chop and the skirt steak both of which were great The pork belly salad was not so great I understand pork belly to be fatty but for the salad we got slabs of pork fat Table set up is also weird as no one got salt or pepper and it takes the wait staff a bit of time to hunt pepper down Overall average to slow service but friendly 
-ECSF0iJL6ygLgnkj6uGaw CMU how common 
-eta-4DMn2ZVQ92R9vXuEQ CMU I enjoyed a relaxing hot tea and appetizers here after a long day of work and evening classes My friend enjoyed a cold beer but it s allergy season so I had a hankering for a hot tea We were lucky that it was late enough a little after 9pm to snag a spot outdoors I have walked by Amsterdam Restaurant Tapas Lounge many times and never knew how great their menu was I should have know it was more than just outdoor seating that keeps this place busy at all hours This will certainly become one of my favorite post class spots to unwind and enjoy good food 
-gqmPziPENHvA7yvEAi38Q CMU Tried the lamb burger with the feta cheese and pesto The cheese was Boursin soft and whipped The pesto was not advantageous A medium rare Burger taste and grill texture was not pronounced It reminded me of a burger I would get from Applebees I arrived at opening My waitstaff Sheree was not assertive She was more of an order taker The staff could have been tense since their bosses were present inside Th outdoor patio is well worth it though It started to drizzle and the umbrella was fantastic Six Point on tap is always worth sitting for This bar is very smoothed out conservative and polished Almost to the point of generic The outdoor scene makes up I enjoy meeting Harlem s diversity here That in itself makes the place a winner 
-LfmhQ72uDNYrZ-pcM2LHA CMU Nothing to jump up and down about but a perfect addition to this neighborhood Cafe Bagutta has warm friendly service a casual atmosphere and you can t beat the price for the food quality They are super accommodating and deserve more patronage than they seem to be getting Definitely a good place to stop for a casual breakfast before a day of studying in the library Recommend Signature Salad Dinner sized delicious salad with an incredible balsamic reduction for less than 7 Spinach and Goat Cheese Omelet is also delicious 
-OyprxGr7qzdMbAeVIzAJw CMU Tasty veggies and salad A good place to eat healthy nice ambiance maybe not the most flavorful in the world though Sat outside which was lovely but our server was ambivalent 
-PyGfsIL6BT25op4pDC6bA CMU Not bad friendly waiter lots of room and a good vibe I liked the place Great selection of beers I tried a new one that I had never had before Son of a Peach and loved it 3 stars though for the food It wasn t too expensive it just wasn t all that The chicken wings were borderline gross Fleshy skin no crisp covered in sauce and just looked ghostly and helpless and they never gave us plates to put the bones on so they sat on napkins The bleu cheese dipping sauce tasted sugary and was thin and watery I will go to have beer but maybe save my meal for another place There is also a bathroom attendant in the coed bathrooms which was male when I went and I found it really interesting that this sports bar pub kind of a place would require a bathroom attendant I don t bring cash with me to the bathroom so I got the hairy eyeball from him for not leaving a dollar for him after he handed me a piece of paper towel Come on now 
-RlBGypuqjZw3G9d7yHoPQ CMU Cooking with local ingredients does not mean great food all the times Brunch at Community Food Juice did not surprise me Blueberry pancakes are better at Kitchenette Uptown some blocks away However the Vietnamese chicken sandwich was really tasty 
-s4b57lFNK6S558etbd3Lw CMU I m all for the local business in the neighborhood So I popped in to have a bite to eat I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and my friend ordered Chavignon Blanc We patiently waited to be served our drinks 20 minutes the drinks arrived Instead of Pinot Noir I swear it was Asti Spumante That was some straight bull crap in the glass I didn t drink it I asked to speak with the manager of course with out any luck Just a bunch of excuses So I m already over the entire place So I ordered dinner Salmon Bok Choy it was ok I m sorry CHOCOLATE you can t get anymore of my money RATCHET with the old dudes by the door ushering people out for a private party Nice space need NEW MANAGER one who actually not ducking from his patrons become better verse with your wine selection WE ALL DON T DRINK HENNEY 1 Star for DECOR 
-u9dGNThIl8pDY5pOjnKkQ CMU Oh no did the quality food fall off to match the attitude of the hostesses yes I walked here for brunch last Saturday with my bf and we both ordered the Eggs Benedict and I was not impressed This is the same meal that I have every time I come for brunch but what happened did the chef have a bad day 
-V9C28pJU9Xw4Sk5ikbozA CMU I ve been to Chocolat many times and had great experiences but this last time makes me question whether I will return again I m a busy mom of two so it s been a couple weeks since my experience but I really need the owner managers to know that what I experienced is not acceptable I went there for lunch on a TUESDAY a couple weeks ago with a girlfriend I had my twins in tow and she had her son with her All three children a under a year old so they are definitely NOT partaking in the food at this restaurant Despite this when we received our bill we were shocked to discover that gratuity had already been included b c we were a large party Seriously We sat at a table for two and had our strollers on either side of the table and the infants did not have anything to eat so why we re we charged the automatic gratuity My friend and I couldn t help but chuckle b c the18 they charged was less than our standard 20 tip but the gall of them to charge two women a group rate makes me question returning any time soon 
-W5lo9Y2JmWBCzwsL4lCuA CMU Chocolat is in soft launch which means full menu but no alcohol They won t even let you bring a bottle of wine like Frizzante did when they opened but say that their license is only a few weeks away That being said the food was pretty good I particularly enjoyed the sesame calamari which was actually large enough to be an entree The house salad was good and large but nothing you couldn t do at home with a bag of mixed greens The flat iron steak special was well prepared and accompanied by potato puree and asparagus The the snapper however while incredibly tasty was overcooked I will go back when I can pair a drink with my meal but probably not often as the prices are steep compared to the other excellent restaurants in the area 
-WeZzw4kkgE-lx9D0lJrNA CMU Don t go if you are hungry I have been to the Harlem Tavern 4x yes that many and with the exception of 1 visit it was quite bad I went to Harlem Tavern for brunch 1x and for dinner 3x My three bad visits were all to blame on the lackluster service and food I had to wait for water 10mins and my drinks to arrive 25 mins the part that is annoying is that it appears to me that the bartenders are not that busy On one occasion after being seated for 45 minutes the waitress had my appetizer and main course come out together sigh Another time after 25 minutes of waiting seated my waiter forgot to actually place our order my drinks appetizer and main dish He then asked us to repeat everything we ordered AGAIN because he forgot The table next to mine was a family where the parents received their entree ate it but their children s dishes didn t arrive until the parents were done Here are some notes about HT Atmosphere Great location with ample seating for all couples large groups and families with young children The entire restaurant has flat screen tv s throughout and on occasion a live dj and a jazz band pretty cool Food Awesome beer selection if that s your thing The other drinks are so so I ve ordered the Amish chicken dish which is great but I wish there was consistency sometimes the creamy polenta is not so creamy The lamb burger was excellent at brunch but at dinner the following times it was eh Don t get the french onion soup I think they make it with beer it was pretty bad so bad it had to be returned Dessert menu is basically nonexistent which is bad for a dessert gal like me I usually just take a little stroll to Make My Cake for a cupcake Service The staff is obviously inexperienced They all need training in how to 1 remember an order ie writing it down on a piece of paper vs trying to remember 2 Placing the order into the system correctly 3 Spacing the order so that my appetizer doesn t come out with my entree mmmkkk Location Perfect location and is easily accessible by car and train I ve tried to call management but they never called me back I guess you can say that s typical So you may ask why do I keep going back if its so bad Because the food is not that bad and I actually have low expectations for bar food seating is always available without a reservation or wait its so easy to get to and the atmosphere I m not sure how long that will last though I hope this review helps you 
-x9UUZd_kz5bEyr6_8ro2w CMU Yummy and healthy Great biscuits strong coffee A bit loud in main room cafeteria style but there s a small back room that is better for conversation I had eggs with this chicken apple sausage it was pretty tasty Its crowded seemingly all of the time as there is the Columbia Upper West crowd Organic fresh ingredients make me want to go back Service was pretty good 
-z8K96EXKFn5_fly8hOdVg CMU I love this place It s amazing to have that kind of outdoor space in the neighborhood and the food is really tasty Sure nothing on the menu is especially fancy but they get the basics right and it s reasonably priced I had the sausage plate which was really delicious I was a little annoyed at how long it took for the food to arrive but our waiter Christian he s fabulous was attentive and entertaining throughout The beer list could be better for a place that bills itself as a tavern but it s certainly a wider selection than anywhere else in the neighborhood although Bier probably has a smaller higher quality selection I will definitely be there again and again 
-zFreEYso8KVCHbcIg7QDg CMU I really tried to look past the negative reviews and try this place out anyway The service was very spotty My group and I ordered drinks and the drinks sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes before the waiter decided to bring the drinks over The waiters were more concerned with make convo among themselves than attending to the patrons I ordered the crab and lobster dish and disliked greatly I had the waiter take it back and went with the burger and fries instead and that was OK i could have made abbter one at home smh The fries were actually good I really liked the ambiance there very mellow and nice decor I would go back but only for drinks no dinner Sorry Chocolat you dont get my vote 
00VlVgGDScXwijRzFvvV8Q CMU Beautiful atmosphere when I walked in Friendly staff great service and the brunch was excellent Will definitely become my new regular brunch spot If you are thinking about going here don t think just do it You won t regret 
01SnyKH8R9YVjQvx5HYHYA CMU i just moved to harlem and have a good feeling that i ll be frequenting this relatively new addition to the neighborhood the vibe is a bit more packed noisy than i usually enjoy but the music is great and the crowd is extremely friendly my brother and i spent a good half hour talking to the guy next to us about technology and dealing with his rebellious teenage daughter it should be noted that neither of us have kids which we readily volunteered at the start of the conversation before he began seeking advice the menu is pretty diverse and delicious every time i ve gone i ve had a very hard time settling on what to order the trio of sausages starter is obviously a must but from there it becomes much trickier i ve had a couple of their burgers and a pulled pork sandwich that i can honestly say is much better than its more famous neighbor 9 blocks to the north and a couple blocks west excited to try the flatbreads but now that i ve had the pulled pork i may never stray from that beer selection is pretty solid although not breathtaking and this is probably my only beef with the place heavy on IPAs and hefeweizens not so heavy on porters stouts or lagers that said i can definitely live with the options and they ve got a fairly solid bourbon selection which helps to compensate 
03xaK0tjVEdpb_fni1WSOw CMU Food overall is delicious Service depends on the day and time of day that you come Weekday brunch I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries Delicious Waitress was really friendly and available Saturday Brunch before 12 Busy as ever slower service but to be fair they only had 1 waitress serving I had the Eggs Florentine delicious Portions are great Coffee was great Saturday Brunch after 12 Not as busy therefore waitresses were a lot more available Had the friendliest hostess waitresses ever I had the Three Egg Omelette with choice of 2 fillings Delicious The bits of bacon were huge two thumbs up Would have preferred more home fries Side Note They were more than accommodating My friend asked for hot chocolate which they didn t have but the waitress was nice enough to whip something else up instead 
04UZvgIavrLAKKpyBD8YwQ CMU This place is all around good but nothing more than that The coffee was good and my croissant sandwich with cheddar bacon and scrambled egg was also good The service seemed a little burnt out on the job and just wasn t very friendly The young woman working the counter just seemed like the last thing she wanted to be doing was working there understandable in the service industry on a Sunday She definitely let it show though by making me feel like every question I had was taxing on her and I didn t see her even give a fake smile the entire time I was there The food was good the service was O K and I liked the ambiance but it was definitely a crowded area with one too many tables for the size of the seating area Overall I would go back there if I was close and wanted some coffee and breakfast but other than that I wouldn t go out of my way to go back here I also would not go there with a group of more than 3 people considering they only had one cook and 2 people working the counter one primarily making espresso drinks when they get hit with a rush things are gonna take a while to come out 
08_lw94785UN7FBuEZ2g0w CMU The Take out Yes here on Yelp is inaccurate even during Snack hour and a half during said snack hour and early brunch CU students get 10 off with ID they scrutinized mine like a reverse bouncer Sat at the bar on the unwieldy stools which were uncomfortable but nice folks The farmer s chop was nothing special but did boast fresh ingredients and a hearty crunch Everything was saturated in dressing which overwhelmed the dish a bit but a solid albeit 10 purchase PS Clinton St Baking Co folks run the jizzy joint 
0bGk5BkfHESW4ctsRi6-1w CMU Certainly pricey for the area and tries to be more than it really is but friendly service solid grub Got the 12 50 Blackened Striped Bass sandwich on a soft brioche roll with pickles lettuce tomato r moulade Cheese was extra and no sides were included so for an UUWS lunch that s pushing it B1018 no starters were below 8 75 NOTE Happy hour from 5 7 along with Sip a couple doors down 
0BQT4pvJMstDUCcCcSrKSA CMU Very cozy and charming place I love the live jazz on Thursday nights and it is a perfect spot for a date The bartenders are very cool and nice to chat if you wish Decoration is classy simple but the place has always been a delight to go 
0C9yTwKNrb_qTT_7mNQfaQ CMU Community is owned by the same people as Clinton St Baking Co however the quality of the food served here does not compare at all I ve been here a few times mostly for brunch since I think that s kind of their forte I ve had the blueberry pancakes veggie scramble and smoked salmon benedict all of which are similar to some of the menu items at their original LES post The blueberry pancakes are served almost exactly like the downtown location with warm maple butter but the consistency and flavor of the pancakes are very much different I find the pancakes served here to be much less fluffy and tender and somewhat lacking in the amount of wild maine blueberries they actually put in the batter The veggie scramble and benedict are also just standards not unlike what you d find at most American restaurants The whole wheat biscuit served here also pales in comparison to the ones at Clinton St a bit tough and too crumbly for my liking Community may be a good option for Morningside Heights especially for fresh American fare However if you want to experience the famous blueberry pancakes by Neil Kleinberg and his wife and partner make the trip downtown 
0EwXOk_Pf-JXrC0gx0q9-A CMU I love chocolate What girl doesn t But this was the first time chocolate deceived me Talk about judging a book by its cover I stumbled upon this place after coming out of a nearby museum exhibition opening Originally my friend and I attempted to dine at the restaurant across the street but were turned away since they were about to close They pointed us across the street I saw the sign Chocolat and my eyes got big and I danced a happy little jig I was so hungry that I didn t check Yelp for reviews mistake 1 As other reviewers have noted I sooo wanted to love this place It was a Wednesday night around 9 30ish so there was no wait that was a plus Ambience was nice Marvin Gaye s Sexual Healing was playing sweet another plus But my giddiness soon came to a screeching halt It started with the wine The waiter super nice guy wasn t well versed with the wine list I ordered a bottle of Riesling and he insisted it was from Africa Hmmm I m not a wine snob but c mon man Rieslings are mainly German good ones that is France turns out a decent Riesling even Australia but Africa Pftt After he realized he was wrong he comes back to deliver the news that they were out of Riesling and brings me a Moscoto My friend isn t a heavy drinker so I went with it But it wasn t till I saw the bill later that I realized the waiter failed to mention that the Moscoto was 17 more than the original bottle I ordered That s a negative in my book buddy Not to mention the Moscoto sucked Almost 50 for a sucky Moscoto is not cool On to the food I ordered from the appetizer menu Baby Back Ribs 14 kinda steep for an app in my opinion with a side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes The ribs were just OK a bit on the fatty side The mashed potatoes were cold and chunky and did not have the slightest hint of garlic to them The waiter noticed my dismay and took my dish back to the chef for an added dose of garlic and a quick nuke in the microwave I presume It tasted a tad bit better but needless to say I didn t eat much more All in all a very disappointing meal My friend ordered the Shrimp Grits the most expensive dish on the menu at 26 I saw that he was struggling to swallow even a few bites I m not a grits kind of gal so I can t judge fairly but from what I tasted it was just not good And the shrimp do not get me started was the most overcooked shrimp I have ever tasted Wait I can t even say that I tasted it because I could not even cut through it with my knife That s how hard and overcooked they were When the waiter came over I demonstrated my attempt to slice and he quickly realized we were not exaggerating He was super apologetic I felt so bad because he looked like he was taking it as a direct reflection of his service They offered to make us another meal but we had enough already and passed on the idea The one good thing is that the manager removed the charge for the Shrimp Grits without hesitation But even though they removed the meal from the bill we still spent more than we should have based on the fact that we paid for the overpriced wine and tipped the waiter extremely well since he really did try his best to fix things Worst part all that money spent and we left hungry Sorry Chocolat but you will never earn my business again The only reason I granted you 2 stars was because of your waiter and the fact that you rectified the bill But this experience really deserved 1 star because the food was simply awful And it s all about the food for me 
0Fck0JjJBszcKpx6ze4ZpQ CMU I can only really comment on the bar happy hour Being right across the street from my college this is a consistent go to spot for drinks for us The happy hour is a good deal all cocktails sangria wine are 5 bucks and they have some nice cocktails The atmosphere is pleasant with the upstairs being more laid back quiet and the downstairs more lounge y The food I have tried mostly appetizers were good no complaints The one time I ventured downstairs during a not happy hour time I think it was 11 was very strange loud music and what looked like nerdy 19 year olds dancing terribly If it s kinda late I d say stay upstairs Oh yeah and table service near the bar area sucks most times I ve been there it ll take at least 7 or 8 minutes to even find a waitress to get you another drink and they make it seem like chore If you re sitting at those high tables you re better off just grabbing a drink at the bar and bringing it over All in all I like the place 5 for a martini after a 3 hour class what s not to like 
0fkpR8udUM7GAwMkNu9Hgg CMU We went on a Saturday for brunch and had a very nice time for the most part PROS The omelets are very big and pretty tasty I recommend the spinach and goat cheese The seven grain waffles were DYNOMITE as JJ would say The syrup was delicious The fresh raspberry preserve was yuuuuumy as well CONS The cafe con leche is not made with espresso Really Maybe living in Miami for several years made me a coffee snob but come on people The simple fact that it is in Spanish means you should not use American coffee ha The waiter had the personality of a snail or better yet a slug Would go back and order a tea with my meal 
0FZV4ctGjxEHWV7wwiOISA CMU Sip is the epitome of an establishment that tries way too hard to be something that it s not The real question is what is it As Heather H points out it used to attempt a more Gothic pseudo Turkish approach to the typical Columbia bar The moody lighting and sophomoric drinks apparently didn t offer anything special enough for the the Columbia scene so they decided to restructure However instead of focusing they broadened their range Jack of all trades master of none is the expression that comes to mind and Sip does nothing right The drinks are all over the place like the terrible alcoholic Shirley Temple that would serve as a joke drink at a gay bar It could be the bartender as the ingredients of their drinks like their Last Goodbye or their mocha martini allude to far better drinks than are served Even more curious is their beer selection the bottles read like the line up at a mid western baseball game while their three beers on tap are two pilsners and a stout What the hell If a restaurant had only three wines would they serve two Pinot Noirs and a Port The food was the second to final insult for me Apparently the pot pie is the owner s favorite I m going to be optimistic and assume the owner lost his sense of taste in a bottle rocket accident The texture of the pot pie was fine but I m not sure how to distinguish it from a Banquet pot pie save for the two biscuits they stuck in it The mahi mahi should never have been on the menu but since it was I don t mind saying that recipes this bad aren t even served at Denny s Essentially it was low grade fish poorly cooked battered and served with lemon and some rice For 21 For 25 I could have had the pre fixe at A Cafe and had the city s best Pheasant Pate and Duck Confit At Sip you get a lump of fish and rice Yes as I alluded there was a final piece to the puzzle The service was terrible and they tack on a mandatory 18 gratuity At this point I don t even care to elaborate on my irritation with the mandatory tip essentially paying extra for terrible horrifyingly neglectful service as describing my anger is liable to cause a stroke Just know Sip is absolutely awful and you should write off the positive reviews as being written by naive college students that prefer atmosphere over substance Don t be fooled If you need a dank pit to drink in go to the far superior Ding Dong Lounge or Negrita a block over If you need food go anywhere else McDonald s even Message me and ask for recommendations Just don t support this place until they figure out what the hell they re trying to achieve and get a staff that has the talent to achieve it Or they give me my 90 back 
0gs1HNYxDfSwe_b0AP0icQ CMU Sip is definitely cool cant take that away from them but I found the food overpriced for the portion size I had the BLTA sandwich it was good I will prob go back but during happy hour or Mondays when food is half price 
0KVh6eR4k2jPiyJpPDyuQA CMU I d wanted to try this place and was excited to get a Google Offer for dinner I had the ravioli and my friend had the burger and fries Actually nearly every table in the place had the fries they seem to be the thing I also had an uptown rye their cocktail list is small but artisinal and we had espresso and flourless chocolate cake for dessert Everything was delicious and full of flavor even the pasta which we vegetarians often get tired of as our only option My friend really got into his burger and was even raving about the bun I ll be back here especially when I need a nice restaurant for all American eaters 
0MWF-unzCb8tHkZa5K4_wg CMU Such potential for this place We watched it go up and couldn t wait to try it Unfortunately though my turkey burger was decent my friend s gumbo was so abysmal she had to send it back it just wasn t gumbo In the summer it was as crowded as The Frying Pan only Harlem Tavern attempts to provide table service outside unlike The Frying Pan And the waitstaff is just overwhelmed during this time We were ready to leave to actually go down the block to Bier for their truffle fries to salvage our lunch and we had to wait so long ti find the waitress ask for the check receive the check get our cards back that Bier was between serving food when we arrived Sad I wonder if this trip s disappointment was just growing pains and I guess I d try it again at some point if only to support a local business 
0nItDOsytv5h-AVrBgQBeQ CMU Bought a Living Social deal to this place and showed up for dinner To our disappointment the deal wasn t valid until 2 days later We were already there so we decided to stay Horrible idea First of all the prices are outrageous not what is listed online A burger costs 12 and doesn t even come with sides or french fries Second the servings are really small which makes you feel worse about the outrageous price you re paying Not the worst restaurant I ve been to the food is actually okay But it s just NOT worth how much they charge 
0sQWQawQvvbwBIrM38OQCA CMU The happy hour specials are great 3 for some great beers like Stone IPA and Dogfish Head but the food is uninspiring and overpriced for what you get I d recommend this place to grad students who are looking for a cheap good drink before heading elsewhere for dinner I usually find myself in the lounge area which is a little less formal than the main dining area It s pretty comfortable and I like the cavernous exposed brick ambiance The big drawback to sitting here is that the DJs and bartenders keep the music at a rather high volume for 5 30pm on a weekday It would be nice if the management monitored the volume more closely so that customers could carry on a conversation without having to shout 
0SQxys9TPaqGkTKvIqv3eg CMU Went here for lunch today had the famous blueberry pancakes They were good but I dunno about great They are extremely sweet and I love sweet things The syrup that even comes with it is like melted caramel Again sweet My friend had a chicken sandwich which he said tasted like they used real quality ingredients The restaurant itself is very trendy and a nice addition to Morningside Heights although if you are a college student you might wanna go to another more affordable restaurant 
0XaWwIZnqBo-BKfVaNFamg CMU Three stars mainly for the food proximity to my house and the fact that it owns Caf Fresh the establishment that used to be there a hundred times over The food is consistently good and I like the space even though it s typically pretty dead which makes the lukewarm service a lot more prominent than it otherwise would be I ve been there for lunch and dinner lunch seemed overpriced 10 for a sandwich I still don t get that but dinner usually has the prix fixe option for 15 which is a good deal all things considered On the other hand the service I would agree is usually subpar I ve only ever seen three servers and none of them are particularly warm or gregarious I usually feel like I m being rushed by the waitstaff which isn t a good feeling when you just want to have a leisurely meal with a book The food comes out quickly enough but I have consistently felt like the waitstaff couldn t care less C mon guys you don t have enough traffic to warrant the I m tired complaint cheer up a bit My other main beef is that the hours in the summer are really inconsistent Morningside Heights is one of those neighborhoods that does suffer from the lack of students in the summer but it really would be nice if they posted clearer year round hours for those of us who stick around 
0zZs2Np3s7mKS117VVWpIA CMU Oh how I wish Toast was good We live on the same block and I pass by it whenever I head out of my apartment We couldve had a great relationship Alas the burgers are nothing special and they always forget ingredients when you order takeout 
12GDPqkc9CXKE6cFE5qIvA CMU Toast and I have a history You see there was a time when I thought I could handle Lex s Long Island Iced Tea Challenge The challenge was hard fought but somewhere amidst the 4th pint of well spirits and soda something happened Something blurry and dizzy And then I woke up on the floor of the bathroom at 5am with 26 text messages and an angry Lex knocking at the door I was arrested on Halloween just outside the front doors of the establishment I have dated women I ve met there bonded with friends and even met one of my closest cohorts at the restaurant Good times aside Toast isn t anything particularly special in and of itself For the Manhattan School of Music alum however its appeal can t be denied As the best local watering hole near the campus Toast has served students well in their after school revelry for years Judged purely as a restaurant and bar Toast comes out just above average The seating is uncomfortable and there is never enough room the bar is too small and the atmosphere is well forgettable That aside it is indeed homely They make a mean burger even if the fries suck They have great beers on tap and the prices are just right So my advice to you Don t go out of your way to visit Toast but if you live in the area or happen to be an MSM student drink up and enjoy 
14y1yCQ_nuvdYkGUvzJQUQ CMU I ve put off reviewing SIP because I don t want more people going there There I said it On the other hand I would like it to stay in business and while I ve struggled long and hard with the dichotomy of my feelings here I am What a great break from my usual Columbia University food crawl The music is always good and by good I mean good if you were born before 1985 and partied to real music I m not being ageist Well ok fine I am The music is even better if you happen to be in the neighborhood at night because they have DJs who spin the aforementioned good music nightly The food is on point and if you come Mondays it s half off Tuesdays wine is half off with 2 food orders You get free tapas if you come for after work drinks for happy hour 5 7 See where I m going with this Cheap food cheap liquor and free tapas What s not to love Well The space isn t big the tables are small tips are automatically added to your bill And that puts some people off I personally don t care I prefer not to do math when I ve been drinking to completely be honest and the service is ALWAYS impeccable so they deserve it thankyouverymuch 
16howGeGR-YrH_BQljy25g CMU We went here on a Scoutmob deal and really liked it The food was good not amazing although I ve probably never had a better Tiramisu in my life OK only in Italy I have The octopus was cooked perfectly so I would recommend that and if you want to try something a little different the fried artichokes on tahini was pretty good too I definitely would come back here if not for the food then for the ambiance It was very romantic and cozy and reminded me of good little restaurants in Europe Overall a really good find in our area 
16PWskwUh_gkIsYYXz5vZw CMU As an expert of brunch spots I would say this restaurant was average in service not a typical comfortable brunch environment and certainly not meant for rowdy drinking but above average in terms of the food quality and options This place is a lot fancier then the usual brunch spot and it threw me off This means that A You feel the need to wear real clothes and brush your hair at 10am on a sunday and B If you become intoxicated due to the unlimited mimosas you will feel very uncomfortable and weary about making sure you don t speak too loudly or appear drunk because no one else is For me the fact that I didn t feel comfortable ask for multiple refills and felt the need to maintain a good posture because there were elderly people and children brunching as well was a bit of a downer The only negative was that if you wanted to get the fixe brunch with the unlimited drinks the options of your meal were very limited I believe there were 5 choices They are all good options and good for veggs too but you can t be too picky The food was very good the burger was especially well cooked and very big the mushroom omlette was good and the corn beef hash was satisfying and unique with it cooked on a skillet with eggs The menu had a good selection with healthy and unique combinations for breakfast if you re not doing the fixe menu and they also had an extensive wine selection I may go back but not to drink and I would probably bring my parents because the average age of customers in the place was approx 45 
17jxkbs6pwPlly8TYAKxUQ CMU Went for lunch and had the steak sandwich It was delicious The atmosphere is nice My girlfriend got the salmon which is the only reason this wasn t a five It was bland and overpriced I would come back for the great sandwiches 
1BfuuWmGuLbqGTuinD-qOA CMU My boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner after checking out the Central Park pool I didn t know what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised We walked thru the doors and were immediately welcomed by the staff and seated After taking a couple of minutes to scan the menu I decided on that pappardelle pasta and my boyfriend opted for the beer and burger special We got a side of the corn and mushrooms Everything we had was delicious You could tell that the staff took their food and the restaurant seriously This place is definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood 
1cI3g2d-c5QzhwkxMPHl4Q CMU Nathaniel B you are right on track Radio is the Columbia U hangout especially on Thursday night when Teachers College goes bad Drink specials and spirited bartenders make this a nice place to be a regular This past week things mixed up like a 5 ingredient cocktail The lights in the front part of the bar went down and the DJ mic went way up He said I didn t come ALL the way up here for nuthin and really rocked it out with hip hop spanning the ages Fun crowd that stays around the front bar and sometimes spills onto the outdoor patio Drink specials are something else on Thursday night Word to the wise it s loud 
1dMXOmeugqY2xEdTZk96RA CMU A very contemporary space with open windows a sleek bar an open kitchen and lots of orange colored accents Concept wise the restaurant wins boasting fresh seasonal local produce along with certification of being green Unfortunately the food doesn t always live up to Clinton St Bakery expectations and the menu is somewhat pricey for the portion size Juice bar is also very pricey I stopped in on my way to class and coughed up 7 for a regular smoothie Still although the price point definitely puts it out of range for most students it hasn t stopped the place from being packed every night thus far I suppose Community would be better if they had better service The first hosts hostesses were awfully rude and unaccommodating which was kind of understandable during its opening hijinks but not so much now Months later hostesses are still rude and waiters remain nonchalant and inattentive with little knowledge of what s on the menu I ve been about three or four times since and while the food has gotten better at times even crave worthy the entire dining experience is always a little sour 
1FVSTWbEaXAOyKfrf68wmQ CMU Great new neighborhood restaurant The space is amazing lots of room between tables and for guests Giant screen TVs for sports lovers Service was attentive Brunch menu is limited hold out for the dinner menu if you can Food was delicious better than expected Sure to return 
1KLENefOggeUQ-BIZthSJg CMU Wonderful neighborhood cafe with yummy sandwiches and salads Incredible lattes and usually really really good iced tea depending on who s working The brunch is awesome try the pancakes or waffles Don t expect super fast food service when they re busy like on weekends cause there s just one cook But it s worth the wait to me Really good happy hour They recently added traditional Sangria to the menu too which is delicious and will definitely give you a buzz after one glass Love the vibe Music varies depending on who s working but I ve loved the mix of things every time I ve come except the one night when it was randomly all reggae all night One reggae song great two fine ten a bit much This is definitely a coffee bar sandwich place by day and a chill bar at night They aren t trying to be anything else and I like that they can wear both hats convincingly Love to Cafe Amrita P S The suggested credit card minimum is just 5 not 10 as someone else posted 
1LU8CDK9HDp-oUnyx309Eg CMU The one thing I love about NYC is that you can stumble on amazing places like Sip I was looking for a bar on a late night that had good music a chill vibe and good drinks Luckily I strolled by Sip with the bff because it was exactly what we were looking for The music was chill and eclectic tunes included records from Beyonce RadioHead Kanye West and my all time favorite classic 80s r b The drinks were delish I opted for a few glasses of the cheap red wine It s really called Cheap Red but its a good mix of a couple of reds It also didn t taste cheap at all and at 6 glass it was a great deal My friend had a cold and ordered a hot toddy this drink was the real deal Jameson lemon cloves honey and a tea pot of hot water to knock that Cold out The atmosphere was super chill I guess I would describe it as a hip coffeeshop type of vibe that happened to have a fully stocked bar I can t wait to come back for 1 Brunch with endless mimosas bloody marys 2 The late night happy hour 2 4am craziness and 3 1 2 off food on Mondays With all of these deals how can you not try this place 
1Lyu6FpJ-lExwu7A-MBjAQ CMU I came here for brunch a few Sundays ago and thought it was amazing The atmosphere was elegant and the croque madam was excellent I would definitely eat here again 
1Nk-ifjRhwEWEDSvr6IeWg CMU I d give it 4 stars but I gave it 5 because of their fall special Fall special get a beer and any burger is 5 happy hour beer on draft is 5 I go to toast often with friends to chill it is just a great place to hang out Low key good enough food friendly service dark Food and drinks their burgers are great side salad is just OK but their sweet potato fries have been consistently good Chicken fingers are good i think they make it with chicken tenderloin which makes them more tender and less dry But they are thinner the batter is not anything spectacular though My favorite sandwich is Mozz sundried tomatoes pepper roasted The cheese is slightly melted and the combination of the tomatoes and peppers is simply delicious I am all about finding what i like on the menu and having the option to choose There is a variety of beers on tap and of course happy hour is 5 Service typical NYC service friendly enough for me to return there all the time It is speedy but attentive Ambiance there are tvs at the bar but never really sat at the bar It is not that spacious but it s a casual relaxing place for friends to hang out and catch up I live near by so i have become a fan of this place but i would not go out of my way to visit this place if you are in the area take advantage of the fall special 
1PeEBJe-d95z_yGhvVBj1A CMU Liked this place Fun atmosphere nice location near Columbia to sit outside Had the daily fish special and it was good but not great Overall a good choice in an otherwise not so food fantastic area 
1RIWk7RZFL40fcVzkpJYKg CMU Fun place to go on a Friday night Has a DJ variety of different items on the menu Enjoyed the food as well as the drinks Would recommend the sangria Also love that they have a coat and bag check as well 
1RUx9jFXkqkbCSHvBAPmJA CMU The decor is what sold me I was treated to dinner here after working on a shoot and we were STARVING We had the empanadas which were ok but you know in NY you can find a beef patty anywhere but I digress I had some concoction to drink I like my drinks a little sweeter but it had me relaxed We both had the skirt steak garlic fries and salad and it was pretty good The salad had a really good light dressing on it I think it was balsamic it was tangy The fries were great I love papas fritas The steak was good too it was a little crunchy on the outter layer but it was still good The restaurant had a great vibe people were dancing Frankie Beverly and Maze was pumping in the background They have a lot of daily specials and a late night happy hour I will definitely be back 
1T5200i6iYEdtD2BTFIUVQ CMU Good place to take friends eat the smoked wings watch the game for and enjoy the patio 
1YizU0HKFogXbh6313CDjQ CMU Brunch review Ok here s my advice Whatever you do whatever you order you MUST have a whole wheat biscuit with jam Oh the jam is divine It s perfectly balanced sweet tart and chunky complete raspberry perfection Put it on the warm biscuit which is tender on the inside with just the right amount of crunchy on the outside Believe it I m totally obsessed with the biscuits and jam So YUM Otherwise everything else was good My eggs were cooked the way I asked thought they were a little under seasoned no biggie that s why there s salt on the table right Hubby had the BELT sandwich and gobbled it up Oh and BTW Kudos Community for serving breakfast on weekdays until 11 30 
1yNvJlogvEeeivLnVcDRAw CMU Ugh No Too much hype I ve been here for breakfast and dinner and while the breakfast was okay I felt absolutely jipped by the dinner It wasn t that good tasted pretty uncooked and I paid too much for it The communal table idea is an interesting one but it s always too crowded too loud and the service isn t stellar in the least It s a shame because the concept is great but I dislike places that gleefully proclaim themselves organic and then overdo it in the pricing and evidently low cooking temperatures 
21mVxEVvcIfgFw2ovi75aQ CMU Food isn t anything special Selection of draft beer is good It s only worth going for the happy hour 
231DovwiSZiQcdN7GCezNw CMU I was looking for a place close that made good buffalo wings I think I found one although I m not sold Toast was definitely kid friendly and the service was good the beer was cold but the wings were just aiiight They hit the spot but I ll have to go again and give them one more shot Hey the atmosphere is fine and the menu is pretty tantalizing sooo I ll go back 
2a5Wvlc-CWjwQY9XPuNhkA CMU Went for dinner The food was kind of disappointing in that it wasn t imaginitive The food serves its purpose but isn t necessarily inspired Waiter messed up my friend s order which was fine they were happy to bring out a replacement of what she wanted White ish walls inside with oak hardwood floors deceive you because at night it looks much more quaint from outside so it would make you suppose inside is just the same I have very little to say about the food as I can barely remember it Friend had hanger steak which was drowned in a salty and balsamic y sauce Sauce might have been better in moderation but I doubt it I had seafood pasta the few shrimps were beyond tough sauce was thin skimpy flavorless waste of tomatoes 
2B0Jl98sbZU8OrV9mzxudA CMU I m very excited to announce a fantastic dessert at one of my favorite eateries in NYC Community s menu is American eclectic with seasonal local and organic ingredients This just hits the spot for me big time Having dined quite often I ve never had a dessert on their menu I know BIG surprise I d been eyeing everyone s plates and I decided I must try their Warm Organic Chocolate Chunk Cookie Plate Three huge right out of the oven cookies were put in front of me They were so warm and soft that they fell apart just picking them up The amount of chocolate in each cookie was astounding just a bunch of gooey deliciousness You can actually taste the sugar granules I could definitely tell they were made with real organic ingredients just by the fresh taste Now you can obviously share the three cookies but you may want them to yourself If you ever feel like Mom s cookies try this neighborhood spot and be sure to order a glass of milk xoxoBrownie 
2DYOWwQpvT9wLTHFkTbjdQ CMU Went to Chocolat to celebrate a friend s birthday on Saturday Sept 22 The decor is beautiful It s more restaurant than lounge although there is a small area to the left of the place and a DJ was there The waitstaff could use improvement they were quite sluggish in taking our group s orders There is one bartender named Erica who is awesome She usually works Thur Sat so I recommend sitting at her end of the bar closest to the entrance The drinks are great I had the white sangria and it was perfect The food is ok but a little pricey Be prepared to wait FOREVER do not come starving Would I visit Chocolat again I love anything Harlem I m a native so of course Would I make Chocolat a priority Nah 
2fLWtNteFlpLwEHTByvXJA CMU Worse service Bacon is even in the lemonade Hardly any beers on tap Waitresses forgot our order three times After 90 minutes my dumpster dive portions were served I was still hungry after I ate You will wait forever for shelter food Godspeed for those who are adventurous 
2Fme9fYR3oHQXv8a6OSA2Q CMU Everything honestly was on the lower side of average Nothing terrible just nothing good either Linguini was soggy creamy soup was mostly cream salad dressing did not taste very good Atmosphere was decent though a little empty for a Friday night The owner was very nice but I am sorry the food needs to be better 
2gRGrMGbrC_YGdl1qZPrAQ CMU This place gets a swift downgrade I ve been touting that you can get the same pancakes as Clinton Street Baking Company at this restaurant because it has the same owners Came here this weekend and that was not the case anymore What happened Now I finally understand the mixed reviews The pancakes I had prior to this were amazing The pancakes I had on this occasion were far inferior These were not the classic blueberry pancakes you can get at Clinton St There were NO blueberries inside the pancake All they did was sprinkle a couple on top The usual fluffiness was also not there Either there was a cook in the kitchen that didn t give a damn or they were too overwhelmed to care It was pretty packed on Saturday for brunch so we had to sit at the bar When we put in our orders with the bartender I had asked for extra maple butter did not get it When we reminded the bartender about it she gave us regular syrup instead and still charged us the extra 1 75 for the maple butter which we did not get Come on Community Where s the consistency I used to sing your praises Lesson learned If you want pancakes don t get them from the younger sibling Suck it up and wait in line at Clinton 
2kJgyzxt55ShAbPxGcRjUQ CMU We d been meaning to try out this place for a while passing it on a bus route frequently but a LivingSocial Instant deal got us in the door on a Saturday night The food definitely offered good value for the price even if we didn t have the discount deal I loved the pan cooked cod with winter veggies and my wife enjoyed her scallops and kale dish The menu seemed thoughtful and focused on seasonal items The service was very friendly The decor is basic but not chintzy We found it cozy enough and a fair backdrop to a good meal 
2KjSLSWV36MUSkio7rq4lQ CMU We just came from this place for brunch it was late and we were the last table they were going to sit for brunch time all the tables outside were wet because it had just rained so we waited for an inside table The host told us after 10 minutes that we HAD to sit outiside or else we would not be able to place our order before the kitchen closed We were sat by ourselves in one of the outside tables that was still semi damp and when our waiter came he said wow you guys were brave sitting out here um yeah not our choice douchebag he sensed that we were upset being forced to sit outside until a table cleared inside however long that might take and instantly became really cold and rude instead of nicer the only redeeming quality about this place is the food while i thought the coffee was not that great the french toast was good and the syrup it came with was delish All in all don t come when it s raining or when it s busy if the stars align you might just be able to get some decent service though i don t advise you hold your breath Come with the right expectation and you might have an OK time 
2lTlDAU8ihSgUSNYfOuOrA CMU I REALLY wanted to like Chocolat but I was pretty unimpressed with this place It was SO expensive for what you got I went there for brunch and was very underwhelmed and the menu was super limited Also a place like this should offer bottomless Mimosas especially since the mark up on the dishes is already so high 
2m-PSHNHtg_wPjjIec7pDQ CMU awesome outdoor space taaaaaaasty sweet potato fries and the owner sheri is way cool highly recommend visiting this spot ok we re still here drinking will finish the review later 
2mJCYuFDGR5V2akkq1vY5A CMU More like 5 and Disappointment I have read nothing but great things about the brunch here but things have definitely changed apparently They messed up a third of all the orders in our party and what we did get was just ok The prices are affordable but honestly there are way too many great options for brunch in New York to spend time at a mediocre one like this one Competency is scarce around this place Just skip it 
2mwJ5dqzi1rcV4scFZYimg CMU We live a block away and like most reviewers on here were excited to see this place finally open after months of construction We came here late on a Friday night after a long day at work and it was a great place to sit down and relax The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting and the staff were attentive and friendly My boyfriend and I each ordered a beer the selection was great and it looked like they had a nice wine menu as well The food on the other hand was pretty disappointing We ordered the cheese plate to start which was good but the main course was meh I ordered the chicken w parmesan polenta and asparagus and my boyfriend ordered some sort of pork and pasta dish My chicken was flavorful but my bf s dish was very bland We had to swap plates because he hated his meal which says a lot because he s not a picky eater by any means we regularly joke that he s the human garbage disposal Nothing really stood out to me between both dishes and for the price I would expect something with a little more umph I really want to like this place and I ll definitely be back but it ll probably just be for drinks at the bar I think it d be great if they expand their tapas selection and do away with the entrees altogether 
2n4NxdTpVogWq49BvSFIHA CMU A decent neighborhood place that does well because nothing else in the neighborhood is decent Still it has a great vibe and the food is good enough the brunch is never worth the long wait so I usually go earlier to avoid the lines Not exactly a destination in my book but if you re in the area and do not want to go far you can t go wrong with this place 
2r1_C6dVUNW-HxV_AqvJUQ CMU Grabbed the Sunday morning bloody mary burger fries brunch special The bloody mary was pretty average but the burger ooh so good We got to choose as many toppings as we wanted on our burger for NO EXTRA CHARGE Awesome You can even get bacon as a free add on although I declined Blue cheese swiss cheese jalapenos grilled onions pickles on the side you know what Just give me all the vegetables you ve got All of that piled precariously high on a perfectly cooked juicy medium rare burger This my friends is a hearty brunch A hungry man brunch One that coats your stomach before you indulge in your libations of choice and gives you enough energy calories to lug stuff home from Costco 
2SDz-5qDU2oRDfBPm-vRew CMU I decided to try this spot out so I made it a place to go to for a first date brunch The Mimosas were very good but when the waiter whom by the way had no personality and could care less about customer service finally brought our order of food to the table I was so excited because my dish of crab cakes w eggs benedict hollandaise sauce looked tasty However I took one bite and the food was grossly salty I could not believed they served the dish with that much salt I told the waiter to take that dish to the chef and ask him if he thinks that the dish was suitable for any human being to eat They agreed and shrugged it off as a bad batch They even had the nerve to bill me for it I told them there was no way I was paying for 1 bite of salty food They took it off the bill and we left I will NEVER go back there EVER again 
2sncCaXV0mC6uN8TRZbTLA CMU The only thing this place has going for it right now is the location and decor Well done steak does not mean one wants a burnt offering which is what I got for an order Salmon BLT was just okay Food had no element of presentation to it at all just dished up and that was that The service was quite slow and the wait staff seemed distracted though that could be because there were only 2 people serving everyone We overheard the folks at the next table commenting that their dessert was the best part of the meal and that perhaps they should have ordered just that not having ordered dessert but going by my experience they were probably right 
2vSManWq7WF2iwDjdIR2ZA CMU EDIT Wow I went here once for brunch see my original review below and it was great but I came here for dinner one evening and it was borderline terrible The server said it would be 15 20 min wait which turned into 45min after being skipped several times in line by parties who had just walked up Upon inquiry I was given an empty reassurance that I was next in line Once we were finally seated our table seemed to fall into the black hole of the servers hosts and bus boy s consciences We had to ask for everything from water in our cups to silverware We didn t really even have a server just a combination of nameless individuals working there who would just pour water or bring our silverware We never heard the specials for the night the food sucked and it cost us all an arm plus a leg Community you ve made it very clear that I m not welcome in your community This was the last time I will come here and no recommendations My initial review as you can see below was great I had awarded them 5 stars How a restaurant can fall that far from its perch is beyond me learn the business then open the restaurant not the other way around ORIGINAL REVIEW Great experience I had brunch here had blue berry pancakes that were just right The other person i was with had the B E L T which is Bacon Egg Lettuce and Tomato it was quite good as well Service was good staff were friendly and the atmosphere was perfect The wait on a Sunday afternoon was a bit long but very worth it especially if you re just relaxing Nothing bad to say here 
2x95AixpPtAFBouridiKOA CMU Cafe Bagutta is a nice small little restaurant good for breakfast and lunch I don t know what they are like for dinner but their menu doesn t seem to be too full of options for a final meal The beverages and food is good and the prices are reasonable Nice atmosphere as well 
2xnThhshe31pjrvT1DWYog CMU i like the decor and the location very close to columbia the food is pretty expensive for what you get though i ve had a bunch of things and have never been impressed with the food the split pea soup is really salty however they do have free tapas between 5 7 though it s a nice place to get some work done in the morning afternoon periods and there are plenty of outlets to plug in your computer at the counters on the side it s a pretty small place though so i m sure i can fill up the one thing i really hate about this place is that one of the guys that works there i don t know if he owns it or manages or what but he seems to exercise some power over the rest of the staff is really rude and aggressive i ve been to sip a bunch of times and every time i ve heard him yell at his staff really loudly in front of everyone i just don t agree with that kind of behavior and feel terrible for the staff members that have to work under him he also yelled at a patron once and after she left he kept on ranting about how she was crazy and weird my friend and i were sitting nearby the whole time and did not notice anything weird about her it was just a very strange situation and he makes me uncomfortable 
2_b-tllPtcK_M4Bw2BmPHw CMU Super cute and lots of yummy stuff on the menu The steak dip was just fab Au jus was darker and tangier than I m used to but was just tasty I d skip the soggy sweet potato fries next time Great and friendly service Would love to go back dessert sounds wonderful too A full bar too The Monty burger with canadian bacon looked amazing French onion soup was piping hot couldn t eat it for a long while but it was too sweet for me I prefer a more savory french onion than a really sweet one perhaps made with a lot of burgundy Toast is a hit 
30NhGEiXdh8c8xPexTTuoA CMU They have enclosed the entire front patio area 
31-zl1e0idyCRixNUKwTxg CMU We walked into sip and this is exactly what happened I was so appauled I wrote out the conversation as soon as we left Me Hi are those couches up there they are like elevator over some speakers Waitress yes they are Friend can we sit up there jokingly Waitress no that s a dj booth are you a dj Friend yes I also know jiujitsu also jokingly haha i mean wasn t it obvious Waitress wow you re really cool We left Bartender Pleasure having you Friend Yeah you too The workers here are not friendly dont bother wasting your time or money here 
34dhfeYCeCXxdgk2XmZ7ng CMU The burgers here hit the spot as well as the brunch Sometimes we order take out and sometimes we stay in and grab a beer they have many choices cause this place is dimly lit and cozy Hummus is a good appetizer but really anything you get here will be excellent and reasonably priced 
3b301M7Ylrg1-A5V_9oxEg CMU This is a terrible restaurant My husband and I went here for dinner tonight He ordered a kale salad and two bites into it realized there was some gross gritty substance in it He told the waitress and she took it back and gave him a menu to order something else Meanwhile I ate my salad the farmer salad which wasn t very good but I finished it anyway 15 minutes later the waitress finally came back to take his order but I was already through with dinner and we had somewhere to be so we asked for the check We told the manager about this issue and he apologized and suggested that we order some food to go in a take out carton huh With the bad food and service we already received we re supposed to spend more money on their food and take it with us to go lol I think not I definitely wouldn t recommend this restaurant because they ve got problems from top to bottom From quality control to service to management it s just all bad I don t see this place lasting Also the food is pretty greasy We had zucchini latkes that had tons of oil on them and the salads were drenched in rich dressing The greens were also semi wilted not crispy which is gross 
3c5bWvD1fm27DtmWD5ZPPA CMU Had Saturday brunch with three adults and two kids Love the ambiance and decor Friendly service Food was very good caesar salad with grilled shrimp french toast scrambled eggs grilled peach chicken arugula salad and fish croquettes over grits All very tasty Only part of the menu was available for brunch but we felt like we had plenty of choices On the pricey side but we felt it was worth it and would definitely go back 
3GFHH4Ae-x-akyvxApRVQw CMU I really want to like this place because it s cute and on my way home from work But it s just been consistently underwhelming The first time I ate here it was in a huge group so I thought the bland food was due to the necessity of ordering from a big group prix fixe menu choose among boring chicken breast or white fish or under sauced pasta So when I was walking past and saw that the soup special was Tuscan Kale White Bean Soup I was ready to give the place another chance The soup should have been named giant chunks of carrots and celery with fatty chunks of ham with hardly any white beans and a couple scraps of kale soup It wasn t too bad for what it was but not impressive either But on the off chance that the other menu descriptions are as misleading as the soup was I m not really eager to give this place another try 
3GWfCmPzAPqbduvH-JWzAw CMU I loooooooooove Cafe Bagutta I lived right next to it for a year while I was doing my MA at Columbia and god knows how many times I have skipped class to have brunch there I recommend the eggs benedict and the pancakes Delicious 
3gyUuC75TOLS3Qw7xGAr1A CMU Great food and atmosphere Clean comfortable and airy space Love the location Near my apartment Holla Delicious meals at great prices I recommend the calamari salad and the Shrimp cheese grits with lobster sauce for dinner Yum 
3ji-Ehcyl5thrS76vCOL8A CMU Even before American Express big upped this place it was a Harlem gem If for no other reason than the fact that someone thought long and hard about the decor which resulted in a super cute and chic little spot with floor to ceiling window panels that open the whole place onto the avenue on warm summer nights Maybe a little misplaced bedazzling but that could happen to anyone But there are other reasons the drinks are great and reasonably priced The food is good The staff is friendly It s really everything that you d want in a neighborhood haunt Or for a slightly boozy brunch 
3tF3KLrxT2J1VeLVubZ-yA CMU I ve been up and down about Harlem Tavern since it opened last year but ultimately I think it s actually a great place and a nice addition to a neighborhood that is in desperate need of good hang out spots The food is nothing spectacular but it rarely disappoints Some of my favorites are the fried green tomato flatbread mussels french onion soup and quesadilla They could use some serious help in the dessert department though I ve been disappointed every time Brunch is also pretty good I usually get the eggs benedict which they make with biscuits instead of english muffins The egg white omelette with asparagus and lobster is also really good when you want something healthier and lighter On Sundays they also play live jazz which is nice but loud The prices aren t bad though perhaps a bit overpriced for what you re getting But the outdoor seating area is great they have a pretty good alcohol selection and overall its a great place to have a decent meal and have fun 
3UmRNIDGVCKgWIwRMSKZvw CMU You know that storefront that seems to rotate in a new restaurant every year sometimes every six months and you ve liked all the restaurants that have been there and you just don t understand why they keep failing because there are other restaurants on the street so you know people go there to eat and really the food has always been good at these places but somehow just as you get attached to the place it goes under Well Stop 125 has set up shop in the former home of Blue Angel and China de Puebla I know too much about this store front to get my hopes up that Stop 125 will stay forever but I ll try to frequent it while I can Currently they re offering all kinds of promotionals to get people in the door A few days ago it was 20 percent off before 7 00 p m and a free bottle of wine Today my friends and I were of the first 10 to come in that door and benefited from a bonus of 50 percent off our bill So we went a little crazy and ordered some small plates chorizo and figs sliders and mac and cheese two entrees steak and mushroom ravioli and a cheese fondue It was a lot of food and it was all solid fare Plus everything tastes better when it s half off 
3y-eqIM5KZjrVU00FHM6dA CMU This place is OK I went here for Sunday brunch and the menu looked really good however the food was really disappointing I got the crispy potato pancakes and the potatoes weren t really crispy They were kind of mushy and gross inside The salmon on top was pretty good but nothing spectacular My sister had the seven grain waffle which was pretty good an the veggie Berger was OK as well still nothing spectacular The carrot hash is mostly potato and not crispy at all Overall I was really disappointed 
3zHqHGorXKlT1u_9trC5mA CMU Great new place on my block Don t be deceived by the main level which is tiny though very unique Below is a good sized dining room and bar Atmosphere is probably the best part of the place with stone walls and great woodwork Great place to grab some drinks especially 5 sangria I had chocolate fondue on my birthday which was delicious though difficult to mess up Though I m not a big fan of olives my roommates loved the fried blue cheese olives Might be easy to miss on the street but worth catching 
3ZmiSwPC3n4pI1Evt46hGQ CMU I think this restaurant is very under rated First of all the staff here are super friendly It was almost weird but not And it s not facetious either They just hire great people here The food is flawless One of the best chicken dishes I have had in ages in NYC 
3_L4973hMSMHj87Xl4nk_g CMU I came here for the 5 for 5 special Basically from 5 30 pm to 7pm on Tu Fri you can get a selection of dishes for 5 What a great deal The portions were much bigger than expected and the food was delicious My friend and I got the wings the potatoes brava mac n cheese vegetable tempura and the sliders Everything tasted great the only thing that was absolutely perfect was the beef slider which was a bit bland and dry We then decided to get desert at normal prices and that was also great What a great find I will be back 
4470LnDRFFcwlwmZSDxXKQ CMU This place is definitely pricey but I have to say that the Miso crusted Salmon was probably the best salmon I have had in a long time The skin was cooked nice and crispy and the flavor was slightly tangy and sweet without being too salty I loved the bed of bok choy cooked perfectly it was slapped on too For dessert we had their famous butterscotch pudding and oh my god that was deli I mean butterscotch pudding is not something super common on most dessert menus and for me it just brings back such nostalgia of yummy childhood desserts I couldn t pass it up To top it off they sprinkled some delicious peanut butter candy I am telling you butterscotch and peanut butter are such a surprisingly perfect duo and I am a chocolate girl The service was good but we did wait forever for our food I mean it was worth it and all given the perfection of the salmon so if you are in Morningside Heights go here I am a TC grad and I can t believe I never tried this place until very recently but I am so glad I finally did 
4cJDvbAHS4HL4tSJrGMOQg CMU Mellow romantic 
4dZczeZ5HsmkTL3bwruEkg CMU Where everything is toasted Although I don t think that catchy phrase of theirs is entirely true it s a cute little place It has indoor outdoor but even if you sit inside you can still feel like you are out which I find wonderful All the food was pretty decently priced I had the mixed green salad with balsamic vin It was delicious It almost tasted like I was eating bruschetta but without the bread I also had the grilled chicken breast with rice which was very good as well I don t have much more to say about this place other than I will certainly go back 
4ERPilsXmC2HMb7dtXzKlA CMU This place is a thug hang out The patrons are rowdy fight prone hard drinking and or gang members Avoid avoid avoid 
4kcO7TMckYNuA7laYBX9yQ CMU We went here last night Friday and it was quite busy but we got a table without a reservation Service wise it was all downhill from there Our appetizers took about 40 minutes and it was almost another hour for our entrees The occasional update from our server would have helped but she studiously avoided our table the whole evening When it finally arrived the food was quite good I had a chilled carrot soup and the chicken with potato puree and brussels sprouts They don t underseason the food to be sure Will give it another shot but never again on a Friday night 
4kPt4WqqzuZ5wqwtaDJbEw CMU First things first we know this place is new and my friends and I came here specifically with that knowledge so we were ready to cut it some slack But that really doesn t make up for all of the problems we experienced We were seated out on the patio which was totally packed on a Sunday afternoon Our waitress came over and took our drink orders though apparently the bar was out of the ingredients required to make half the drinks on the menu and two of the five drinks we did receive were either so diluted or so sweet that they were totally undrinkable To the credit of the place though the Brownstone cocktail is quite good One of our party members was famished and we asked a couple of times to see the food menu and we were repeatedly told that The manager is wandering around with the food menus ostensibly in some sort of attempt to space out the orders in the kitchen What we began to notice though is that the place was severely short staffed with way too few employees to service the entire restaurant After a second round of drinks that took nearly twenty minutes to arrive we decided that we weren t going to wait on food after all the menu was decidedly underwhelming and the folks around us all seemed quite disappointed with what they received so we got the check which was obscenely high for as little as we had actually consumed I don t think we re going to be going back for a while This joint really needs to get its staffing issues under control first 
4M_nsBfwAvD5lwjYBuIdgQ CMU omygod i love this place the food is super fresh and super tasty i would go every day if i could sadly i can only go saturday for brunch a 20minuteish wait but worth it i ve had the blueberry pancakes superb and an omelette which also tasted amazing the juice isn t to die for esp since it comes in a tiny cup but it s still good the service was good too 
4ngvMuQiQ6PPt1JmtxKkAA CMU I was very disappointed with Harlem tavern I have to say Location is coming up and the space is pretty decent but where the hell is all the beer Every beer the gf and I ordered they were out of For a place that falls under beer garden they don t have much beer We only came here because we went online and saw the selection of beer We also had to order food in order to sit which is kind of crazy since the place was not even that packed There were plenty of seats available The fries we ordered for a party of four were good but come on At the end of the day Gf had a Raging Bitch and I had the Albino Python Both were good We also had a couple of Sam Adams Summer Ale I m giving this place one more chance I hope they stacked up on beer for years 
4NH8mjLkoSZEC3TK8tLypQ CMU I ve had a decent hanger steak here But the salmon caesar salad tasted like a shoe store For every good item I had there was another dish to ruin the experience Given the high hit and miss ratio I d save my money and try something else 
4PiWZP9hhFGitpe0auSuug CMU Uptown surprise Not the biggest pub or tavern fan why you may ask Drunken overgrown frat boys corny dated soro girls bad music subpar food and overcrowding ahhh but then I went to Harlem Tavern on a whim and you know what I was presently surprised It actually nice to go to a place that has mid to low key after work vibe with a mix of people young professional to blue collar a place that s actually playing decent beats a place with a decent selection of beer and room to move around So yeah I had a good time Chill doorman and hostess huge patio diesel sized booths and enough stalls to keep a drinking man happy The prices are line the drinks are poured appropriately I however didn t try the food but it did look OK Oh and yes there was a decent amount of eye candy on hand 
4pr1y79QCCMkHcqTAwDdOQ CMU This beer garden a former auto body shop gas station is such a great addition to the neighborhood I LOVE HARLEM TAVERN Reasonable Price Spacious and Trendy Atmosphere Great Vibe Delectable Food Spectacular Music and Baby Kid friendly this is what sold me My only complaint is that it s constantly packed BUT a busy and packed restaurant is a good sign to me 
4t5_4PYIg6bcFjBTD8SWcQ CMU Came here for a late brunch with some buddies It was a small wait to get a table but once we got there it was fun Great food for a decent price I like the atmosphere Will likely be back again soon Recommended 
4TWOTn08ptZjh9BFK08nJA CMU I ve had Community s breakfast brunch which was good Yesterday though my girlfriend and I went in for lunch But they don t do lunch they have Snacks The gentleman that greeted us at the door had all the charm of rusted nail and seemed annoyed He was older than the rest of the staff I assume a manager but he wasn t very hospitable The way he explained the snacks made my gf and i want to leave right then but we stayed We sat for the duration of 4 songs and no one had attended us We had looked at the menu with the lame host guy and decided then and there what we wanted so that was a bit frustrating to have to wait to order our snacks I ordered the burger my girlfriend had the Chop salad and Edamame Hummus The food took 30mins to come out When our server delivered he claimed they were going through a changing of the guard but my bottom bun of the burger was soaked with grease seemed to me that it had been sitting a while I ordered the burger medium but it was charred black outside and as gray as a newspaper inside The salad was small but tasty and same with the edamame hummus My gf and I are thirsty foodies our waters were filled twice which was tough for me with my overcooked burger The pita chips that came with the edamame hummus also have some heat so a little more water would have been nice We had our empty glasses sitting on the edge of the table for a while The floor and kitchen staff seemed incompetent and a little rude it wasn t busy at all yesterday so its not like they were flooded While waiting to order a server came to the station directly behind us and then called over the rusty nail guy to ask where s the clock out button Other guests seemed thrown off and unsure of who worked there While I was looking for the unmarked bathrooms an older lady seated at a table was handing me her credit card assuming that I could close out her transaction I should have taken it and brought to the rusty nail Minor things that bothered me as well a lady who sat next to us was seated after us but she got her meal before us Additionally but this is just me I ordered chamomile tea but they serve the tea in a mug with the bag I hate leaving the bag in my mug for the duration of my drink they didn t have a dish or anything to dispose of it But that s just me 
4wB2cqcknWedveEPvDrKGQ CMU Excellent food great design and aesthetic service has been friendly and efficient Prices are a bit steep which yields 4 stars instead of 5 
4wr8oDXr_6sGzHLIMeeLCw CMU closed anyone know 
4xAKcJHijMdY642EKD-mWg CMU crappy food crappy place crappy manager thats all 
4YlDXiKCJDFyD6SaSPN-GA CMU Everyone in the neighborhood was excited about this place but frankly its just not very good maybe give it 1 1 2 stars to be generous The food is lackluster pub fare which is depressing because if you can t make a burger or fries properly then how the hell are you gonna be able to pull off salmon or a steak The service is poor and disinterested Good luck getting condiments or salt or even a water refill if you need one your server will deliver your food and then piss off until its time to pay The decor is nice but it is incredibly LOUD and obnoxious so if you are looking for more of a boisterous bar type environment then it will be fine but not if you are looking to enjoy your meal and be able to hear your companions across the table I m actually amazed that this place is doing so well I guess its because there s nothing else in the neighborhood and its a big place with lots of outdoor seating I think if you just wanted a place to drink beers all afternoon and snack on bar food it would be fine but beyond that its jsut a big disappointment 
4_aAbWOJJihPAz3hs4hN8w CMU Upon moving to the neighborhood this was my first dining experience in Harlem I was skeptical at first just because of a stigma of eating in Harlem but I was pleasantly surprised I was pleased with the menu service and the prices The food quality is superb and it is the perfect place for gatherings of people on all budgets This is a downtown restaurant in a uptown neighborhood We have eaten there three times since January and are eagerly awaiting a delivery option from there menu 
4_Het91WLgK8CACVgtRaBA CMU thank God for this place because trekking all the way down to clinton st baking co is CRAZY fyi this place is the sister restaurant of clinton st baking co so it s a great alternative for us uws folks my friend got the B E L T and it looked really good i got the banana walnut pancakes and it was so good this place is bigger than clinton and it s nice to sit outside in spring sunday brunch is obviously busy so expect a wait not too long 
52KTq7pJj7lZFNzZaaIR-A CMU Absolutely loved this place Whether you go for lunch or dinner or just a drink anytime of the day the ambiance is cool There are fun people hanging out with the wait staff extremely helpful and happy Weekends have jazz which is brilliant for the neighborhood it s in and representing its namesake Harlem baby 
54x_VAl7bwnYr1zTT9ekaQ CMU Would you like to go out for an epic and satisfying dinner Here is my humble suggestion Order the Strawberry Rhubarb Margarita for your starting libation Order the rice bowl for your entree chock full of carrots zucchini bean sprouts radicchio cilantro and mint in a sesame lime dressing Order the coconut banana cream tart for dessert or pray to a higher power that they have their special homemade butterscotch pudding that s too delicious for words Cap it all off with a nice cup of Harney Sons peppermint tea Be content Thank me later P S Hope that you get the adorably spunky and awesome Australian woman as your waitress She s an utter delight 
56EDFEBanyLL4bt-llIBag CMU The flatbread and steak with peppers was really tasty We had an office party here 30 people Some of my office mates complained about the benches we were provided and were immediately accommodated with chairs Whether or not they were being reasonable they were given what they requested so bonus points for the staff Get the Nutella chocolate cake and a cup of coffee JUST DO IT I was never without drink which was key I would definitely go back Oh and free secured wi fi 
574nXVT4vIvxvIi0Nev3MQ CMU A great concept that unfortunately doesn t live up to its potential In my several visits the food has been inconsistent very good to mediocre and the service touch and go The organic coffee has a strange aftertaste If your party is small I recommend sitting at the bar as you ll skip the enormous wait but be prepared to be constantly bumped by careless servers passing behind you There s always an element of disbelief when the bill arrives how could that REALLY cost this much Considering the quality terribly overpriced 
5aHrwY8FGZ6eB-gTPVAPhQ CMU Came for dinner one cold night My glass of prosecco warmed me right up As did the shared pizza with duck and a plethora of cheese and the salad with goat cheese medallions I love the warm atmosphere and food philosophy fresh and local Plus more love since I ve learned that this place was started by the owners of Clinton St Baking Co Can t wait to come back and try their fluffy pancakes and biscuits 
5cHwTph3eIv_YMPN9zg56w CMU went here on a friday and all the bar seats were taken outside of that the place was empty but it was still early 7 30 8ish seemed nice though inside and i would have liked to stay longer if there was room at the bar noone seemed to try and get any chairs for us but hey it is what it is 
5Cux6e4InpVoX2fFYQRNVQ CMU So I stayed near here while on vacation in New York and was really happy to find this place within walking distance of our hotel We made reservations for a Monday night but did not really need them there was plenty of tables The food was excellent We first started with the Grilled Flatiron Steak Skewers and the roasted corn salsa that came with it was amazing a lot of flavor in the chimmichurri sauce as well I ordered the cedar plank salmon and again fish was very good and the olives peppers tomato confit that came with it was the perfect combination of flavors for this dish The only disappointment was that normally when I order cedar plank salmon it is grilled on the plank and this was obviously just placed on the plank and it appeared that they used the planks over and over again because there was knife marks on it My husband ordered the hamburger which was also very good and a very large burger This place does have some noise but a large beer selection all around 7 and would be a good place to watch a game They have a very large patio area with TVs We went back to this place later in our trip just for drinks We always got good service and they also make pretty good Sangria 
5EOCQuvfJPH_zOj0t5fJ4g CMU WOHOWW The lamb burger is DERRICIOUSSS There is cheese INSIDE ThE pAtTyyyy Lovely Excellent cajun fries Good margaritas D 
5GSCreDJSov18sh4EkQkDA CMU I hear a lot of people tell me that this place is either a hit or miss Well I have never had a miss while dining here The Food is always excellent the service is always helpful and the specials are where it s at Maybe thats why I ve never had a miss I always go with the servers suggestion add in a margarita or the Hot Butter Cider Rum and the meal is on It s expensive if you are on a budget so make sure you spend your money on something that will well worth your while 
5Iqryo9GSqCmrX1xPkvOOA CMU Did you know about the 9 breakfast special Blueberry Pancakes and coffee Not awesome but not bad Community offers a simple elegant and thoughtful menu I ve had most everything on the menu and haven t come across anything I didn t like So why the 4 stars They stubbornly won t take reservations and they almost seem proud of their 1 hour 45 minute weekend waitlist The food here is great but not divine 
5k0dTUnw3V3JNpqDOaidYQ CMU I went it to this place not expecting much and I can say that after being there twice this place is OK Just OK average service and average food nothing spectacular They did have a good selection of microbrews and their skirt steak is nicely seasoned but I would not go out of my way to get here If your in the area it is good enough to enjoy a beer and some grub but I doubt it will be a memorable experience 
5KDEu2Ayh4_HqqhmEu1pyw CMU Went here for brunch on the Groupon deal back in February We got there a bit past noon and it was pretty crowded but they let us wait at the bar and had us seated pretty speedily I had the Kentucky Country Ham Crispy Poached Organic Egg the ham was a bit too salty strong even for my tastes and I oversalt everything The veggies themselves felt a bit like eating herbs or grass Somehow I get this a lot at organic seasonal restaurants Nothing remarkable The egg was great though like a nice fusion of fried poached cooked to perfection Max had the Poached Eggs Ten 18 which is supposed to be a classic item It seemed good I dunno unhelpful But really it was too much poached egg in one meal I really liked the atmosphere vibe here so we stayed a bit longer drinking our coffee which magically refilled itself The bread was delicious too Interested in checking out their other menus next time we re in the city but it was a bit overpriced 
5LMDCBzMplBhXjiCfK4YLw CMU I really really liked this place Faced with a bevy of choices for brunch when I emerged from the C train station while visiting a friend who lived nearby the harlem tavern just seemed most inviting They had a large courtyard patio that my friend said they cover and heat in winter A jazz band plays Sundays and Saturdays for brunch Lots of tvs at the bar were showing sports too Their brunch menu was a fixed price of 14 95 for one of about 20 items some more breakfasty and some more lunch ish With it came a mimosa bloody Mary or beer Or you could get a lemonade soda or coffee in place of that if you were say out til 3 am the night before not speaking from personal experience or anything I got the tina nicoise sp Salad which was well presented and tasty My friend got an oyster po boy which came with about a zillion sweet potatoe fries Later in the afternoon I couldn t resist a dragonberry mojito Yummy but a touch too sweet Anyhow really liked this place With the courtyard on the corner of 116th and 8th I think anyhow it felt very happening with a nice vibe I ll be back 
5nyh3JggJLZSMCoiozQITQ CMU I ate here a few weeks ago but I don t remember what I had so that s pretty telling It wasn t nasty just kind of fine and unremarkable However I do remember the hot cider I had It had honey mint lemon and was delicious I almost wished I had a sore throat just to feel the difference afterward The restaurant was pretty noisy but that I had a lot of outdoor seating which might have been better If I m in the area I d probably come by for a cider but I ll never go out of my way to come back 
5ORQwCl0b9yiB3s-Z-kWkA CMU Otherwise known as just Chocolat this new upscale Harlem restaurant is physically appealing with a nice modern yet warm design Although I did not take advantage of the full menu I did have an appetizer and glass of wine The appetizer was impressive and the wine good enough but the appetizers list is over priced especially for a new eatery with an unknown chef They are charging entree prices for appetizers with the least expensive coming in at 12 Most appetizers are from 14 20 Appetizers should be 5 9 for the most part That said my appetizer of fried calimari was very tasty with good presentation Overall I m sure Chocolat will prove to be a nice addition to the neighborhood but even better when they reign in their prices and improve their wine list 
5oZaTeM1j0nRzyig1CsJmQ CMU This is one of the best places to read study catch up with friends in Manhattan Valley or really West of the park They have a bar that is open at all times they have coffee drinks that are available at all times and they have a decent selection of food coffee shop like food available at all times The noise isn t loud so it makes for easy studying I would say this is not the best place to have an incredibly personal conversation well at least not in the mornings But every time I come here at night the music is going the tvs are on and the atmosphere is always really really fun The only thing is that if you are planning to bring a party greater than 4 I would go else where 
5PqU2o4_Eh_BC_pV1kAgOg CMU I really enjoyed my dinner at this establishment and I will return for a meal or for drinks Nice ambience and fantastic menu It s tucked a way in an interesting location but that adds to its charm We had the Chicken Sliders and Fried Oysters for starters I don t recall the exact names of the entrees but we had the Pan Roasted chicken Cod Hake Strip steak and Lamb The plates were enjoyed by all They do a wonderful job of accentuating each dish with complimentary side items like chimichurris and flavorful vegetable medleys The crowd ran the gauntlet from 20 somethings having drinks to 60 somethings having intimate get togethers I say intimate because it isn t the largest of places The only issue I had was being asked twice to scoot this way or that way to accomodate entering diners The staff was friendly and helpful Finally the cocktail list makes the place worth a visit and I absolutely adored the Left Hand Milk Stout I wasn t moved by the dessert list but that s ok the food and drink atmosphere and crowd was enough to make me return Try this go early to get a good feel of the place and make your own decision 
5qaiv7Ll-c4PriGcKHN0Lg CMU Reasons to like this place It s open pretty much 24 hours it s only closed from 4 am 7 am The atmosphere was surprisingly cute and cozy and not in an overbearing downtown way but in a reasonable uptown way During good weather they open the windows and doors so it can be a really pleasant atmosphere The sandwiches are surprisingly tasty I tried a BLT and Avocado sandwich and the bread was toasted just right the bacon was crispy and didn t have gristle the avocado was ripe and it came with a side of vinegar green pea salad which tasted great The cocktails are inventive and strong I had a particularly potent pineapple tequila cocktail that gave me a totally bitching vertigo episode The free wi fi Decent internet speeds Reasons to dislike this place Price As a Manhattan cafe geared toward Americans with too much money they feel completely comfortable charging 10 for a BLT sandwich and 10 for a cocktail I m used to going to little deli convenience stores and getting an even better sandwich for 4 5 If they want the price to justify what you get they ought to think about making the sandwiches much bigger I was still hungry after my 10 BLT sandwich which just makes the whole thing an illogical meal Why would I come up here and pay 10 for a smaller sandwich if I can walk 1 block and get a huge and delicious sandwich for 4 5 at Andy s Deli I expected that the price would be a little higher because of the arrogant yuppie factor but come on there s no way this BLT sandwich is worth 10 Automatic gratuity I m a pretty good tipper Having worked for years as a server I understand that good service should always get at least 20 25 but at the same time I frown upon places that slap an automatic 18 The only thing this policy does is removes the incentives for the service to actually be good It was a somewhat obvious symptom here because although the server was friendly and lively she wasn t very attentive nor reachable I was still planning on giving her about 20 regardless but I think automatic gratuity is a sleazy concept It s a gesture of hostility to the guests and implicitly states that customers can t be trusted I ended up leaving less money the obligatory 18 than I would have left I was thinking 20 22 in this case because I felt insulted So one pineapple cocktail and a BLT sat me back 25 when you take into account the tax and mandatory tip The lunch was definitely not worth 25 in my opinion I would have much rather had a 4 95 falafel sandwich from Soom Soom or Maoz instead of paying 25 for the lunch I had here Comfort Although I said earlier that the atmosphere is cozy the seats aren t People are sat close together and in rigid chairs I ended up sitting at the elevated bar stools so I can have my personal space but the chairs were too uncomfortable to sit there and get some serious writing done like I had originally planned Also there are no power outlets for laptops The hipster and yuppie factor Tables with glued pennies underneath the glass in an attempt to be postmodern Nuff said 
5T2rWzze3bkKsITVMBdllQ CMU Pretty nice and cozy place on the cirlce just off central park Ordered a sandwich chips and four beers and it wasn t a bad price at all Great place to relax with some friends or could even see it being good chill spot if you were alone and just wanted to get out of the house 
5TLCDc4AlzL9bsIdI4PrOg CMU I don t know why everyone raves about this place We ordered two brunch dishes coconut pancakes and farmer s place Half an hour later I don t know how it can take that long to make pancakes and eggs when it s not crowded our order gets delivered The breakfast is average The pancakes were delicious and the sweet coconut maple syrup was definitely great The eggs were absolutely flavour less and overly yellow food colouring The saut ed tomatoes were normal Bread was bread A slice of cheese made no sense on that plate And grapefruit juice was definitely diluted all 4 ounces of it Is there a grapefruit deficit I didn t know about And that s it For 30 and 30 minutes you get some pancakes and eggs I see no reason why anyone would want to choose this place over a myriad of others in Manhattan 
5U4dYXjNUGtr-qCZXiw-rQ CMU Community is an asset to Morningisde Heights Perhaps my opinion is skewed since there are almost no good places to eat in the hood but I really do enjoy Community The inside is very chic and clean long tables light colors huge windows open kitchen etc The prices are a bit high but the food is really good especially breakfast and lunch Very fresh and beautifully presented The sign is quite inconspicuous but Community is worth a trip and a few passes in order to find the door 
5u6tBUsIYZ4hwZABcRw_NQ CMU This definitely the best place in the neighborhood Very cozy in the winter A great place for a last minute romantic dinner even on a Friday night Sea food dishes and wild boar are paired easily with good wines and beers A place casual enough to strike up a conversation with the locals LOVE IT 
5UwW48gTzLD8tKtF-M63Cw CMU Though this spot has suffered some growing pains since first opening I can definitely say that they have come a long way The menu has been expanded and the beer selection is one of the best in the city This restaurant has amazing outdoor space which is perfect for the summer time I love the location and the atmosphere is great for not only young professionals but also for families and even children The staff is sometimes not as attentive as you need them to be but they are super busy and you can see that they are trying their best Still a few kinks to work out but over all good dining experience Looking for the perfect cocktail at this spot Get the Harlem Celebration You ll thank me later 
5vwP6Bj88ZB0wZEDCIjSgQ CMU Open again after being shut down by the health dept Unfortunately the new crowd is rowdy and dangerous Fist fights outside have become common Go at your own risk 
5y1CAjAlJMOclGsuaw9pkw CMU So I love HFB This place reminds me of a flakey friend who is not always reliable but you just can t get enough of them despite their inconsistencies I am partial to Harlem Food Bar because it is my neighborhood bar and because I have a small obsession with eye candy whether they are in to me a beautiful woman or not This food bar will surely live up to the name You hungry They will feed you Thirsty They ve got that covered too However it is just an eating experience not dining which means you may have to search for your waiter waitress occasionally might wait a little longer than you d like for your drinks BUT it s filled with great company a lovely staff GOOD FOOD PERFECT DRINKS My favorites are the veggie burger the wings their french fries perfect and the sparkling rose 
5z5oNR1rvOudXeas_MhrZw CMU Went here to meet a girlfriend the other night at around 7 Not only were they out of 50 of the wines on the list they were also out of all the boozy infusions they are famous for I settled on a vodka cranberry which was OK and has the bacon wrapped prunes which were tasty but a little too cloyingly sweet for my taste My girlfriend ordered a glass of chard the only white they had in stock it was pretty horrid worse than the stuff we used to consume copious amounts of during college Her brie and eggplant sandwich was OK but not great Don t think I will be heading back anytime soon 
5_0VaxwXssKYwo51HqddEw CMU I ve been here for drinks a couple times They have delicious sangrias Just last night I had the peach sangria and i highly recommend it they have some happy hour specials too on drinks which is nice this area of the UWS has mostly dive bars so Amsterdam Cafe is a nice change to those 
642jdcUcHx1t97xxwdCC_Q CMU Solid pub Good brews on tap and great happy hour prices Usually good service Great burgers killer bbq turkey sandwich and at brunch spot on hollandaise 
690L0ckxqGlhy3yXQF4iqw CMU Pros Cute place Happy Hour the bacon burger tapas were freaking DELICIOUS maybe it s because I had zero expectations but they were the best sliders I ve ever had Good service Cons Way overpriced for regular meals couldn t even get myself to order from it even though I was really hungry Sangria pitcher we got was not that good Frying Pan s sangria was wayy superior 
6ba2LFKN3pgvaUDIziLqbA CMU Refreshing new addition to the neighborhood Great ambiance and staff is friendly and attentive Gotta try the fried blue cheese stuffed olives 
6BpEmd-Uyqt0AonsU0BJqw CMU Service was extremely slow A member of our group of 4 had to get up and search for someone to take our orders and to bring us our check later on I was brought the wrong meal The food was average nothing to rave about I wouldn t be opposed to eating here again should the situation come up but I m not going to make it a point to go back 
6EFPGh8TMUiTCyRwwfLQFw CMU Mojo is a wonderful new option in Harlem My brother was in town and wanted to eat in Harlem i used to live uptown and thought of some of the usual places I m glad we opted for Mojo instead The menu is a bit pricier than other places in the area but the food is delightful Mojo is a bit confusing in that I m not sure what type of food its supposed to be but once I got my meal it didnt matter Everything was delightful fresh and the flavors complimented eachother well I cannot wait to go back They experiment with flavors and it pays off The day I was there service was a bit slow and the neon pink lighting at the bar was a bit harsh but overall Mojo was a great experience I cannot wait to go back 
6ErC731ZZsUJW4OVib3QNg CMU The Bacon changed my life And I m a sausage girl 
6FYBNbX3VF_nkvvFvTkrEQ CMU I don t know how to start this review because I feel there are as many good points as there are bad so I ll just walk through the meal starting from our visit We started off getting there and needed a table for 5 but only 2 of us were present they refused to seat us or even put us on the list until our whole party was here It was frustrating because we told her that they d all be in 10 minutes which they were but still wouldn t place us on the list We ended up waiting for nearly an hour and as good as the food maybe it is NOT worth waiting an hour for I ran into a guy who came in by himself who was waiting for nearly half hour I realized one major problem is that many times people would just go seat themselves without even waiting for the hostess and that was the major problem After finally getting seated we checked out the menu which seemed appealing we were fortunate enough to have a great table secluded to our party and we were starving My major problem with the breakfast selection is that I like to have more than just one thing in my meal for example if you order pancakes you should get a meat or eggs along with it In addition my friend ordered a burger and they said they didn t carry lettuce or tomatoes that s absolutely absurd I ended up ordering the blueberry pancakes with the chicken chorizo and it was actually really good The coffee was also fresh and they did a good job of keeping the cups full Unfortunately no breakfast is worth waiting 1 1 5 hours for so I don t think I ll be visiting this place anytime soon 
6GMtGX7XPbEbHieOR7ChUA CMU Stumbled in here with a date after having a few drinks elsewhere Cute atmosphere but why did the football game need to be so loud Cafe vibe but with a big screen TV with the game on Weird That being said a glass of decent cabernet was only 5 and there was plenty of comfy seating where I could actually hear my date and there was a fair amount of space between us and other couples The bartender was a little spacey but left us alone which was nice After the game he put on his iPod and proceeded to play top 40 hits from six years ago We were listening to Usher s Yeah which was hilarious and also a little bit sad I wouldn t go out of my way to go back here but it was pretty nice for what it was My date told me that their brunch is pretty good too 
6IdTQKRRQY_Dz0Fp061u_g CMU Whenever I m in the area this is a great place to stop for a coffee tea or glass of wine It s a good place for me to get a little work done Quiet but not too quiet Good music Good ambiance Service at the counter so when you take a seat you will be left alone Very close to the train at CPW and 110th so great for meeting up with people in that part of town 
6IIz5gfu5eGJabguWQjdQQ CMU The food is above average Good beer selection The bartenders and wait staff are very friendly I like the Eggs Benedict 
6IjwFAifW4QveuuemsDyfw CMU not for the diet conscious but their mac and cheese is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING everyone i have made try it has been blown away by it i wish i still lived close by so i could stop by occasionally go for it 
6KiHok6y4lWoVnlzjBbCaA CMU Soft Opening still in Progress Date Rating 6 Pick up Scale TBD Strong Suggestion come over and give it the ol Yelp try 
6l1l9kwRmCrZW9rXvFMtdg CMU I work remotely so the world is my office my tools my trusty laptop My search for free wifi led me to Sip Nursing a hangover from the previous night of rooftop debauchery a bar was not what I had in mind but I was drawn in by the low key friendly atmosphere Although I only ordered iced coffee the waitress brought over a generous heaping of free tapas a spread that included olives bruschetta and garlic and never was I under any pressure to vacate my table The DJ kept the vibe going spinning downtempo hip hop I ll definitely be back for drinks when I don t have to work 
6mdo-lVnsER4Dy7eSK7uxw CMU Ordered standard mozzarella sticks sliders and a couple of beers Nothing special But the atmosphere was great I enjoyed the chaos going around on every table I loved the energy and the noise It would be a great place to just celebrate and let loose Though I don t know why people bring kids even newborns Yikes to a beer garden 
6mkdb67w_T8oY9WykXhqag CMU With deals so hot the definitely need to get AC Came by for the free internet Stayed for the half off food Everything on mondays is half off Rib dinner for 10 boom sandwich dinner for 5 bam How do you go wrong It s a little too hot when it s in the high 90s outside Also they put 18 tip on everything so don t be suprised when you see the bill 
6mR0IVBk7o_U7I4XZu2fLw CMU Great food poor poor service but it s early so I ll give them a break My roomie and I visited Harlem Tavern on a Thursday sunny late afternoon and were siked because we live a block away and have been STALKING this place since we found out what they were building We arrived at 6 so there wasn t much of a wait for 2 to sit outside We were sat at our table but didn t receive water or a waitress for about 10 minutes When she finally came over she leaned on the back of my chair and said Are you ready to order No hello no small talk just a are you ready to order Okay no big deal so we order our food takes FOREVER and shows up after the table next to us received their food they sat down 20 minutes after us Throughout the meal no refills and then when we pay the waittress drops off the ticket and walks away I check for my change and it s not there URGG Then I wait 5 minutes for her to come back and ask about my change She replies Oh I have to wait for change at the bar WELL COULDN T YOU HAVE SAID SOMETHING TO ME BOOOOOOO However I had the Portabello Mushroom Burger which I GREATLY enjoyed and my roomie had the Turkey Burger and loved it as well Both burgers were a nice size and were accompanied by fries the have sweet potato fries as an option I d recommend going here for the outside seating and good food just be prepared for not so great service 
6NclkjKAh7LZEF2i0gvCVw CMU I thought my awful dining experience was over but apparently it drags on The management sent me this message through yelp I want to take a moment and let you know that we do not have walnuts anywhere in that kitchen so what you may have mistaken for a nut was the seeds from the eggplant Furthermore you did not inform the server nor the management of this issue as it could have been dealt with appropriately telling the hostess on the way out and bashing the management for neglect when there was no communication is to me a little odd Being in the food industry for 11 years I take allergies very seriously considering I have one myself I personally saw that dish being prepared and can assure you no nuts were present we would like to know if there is any problem with the food as far as safety is concerned that is something that needs to be expressed and dealt with not passively written in a review I m sorry you had a bad experience I m confident in the food we are serving and the capabilities of my wait staff I only wish you had given us an opportunity to make things right Note I did inform the server of my allergies Obviously On what planet could an entire walnut be mistaken for eggplant seeds Why am I being sent harassing messages by them after they nearly sent me to the ER And why are they trying to censor this 
6odedcAltZYbTS6O3uw2Yg CMU These fellows are good and they know it which is why they re on the pricey side even though they re way uptown But essentially they could compete with any of the super trendy New American places in the Village Mussels were a rave and the pork belly an absolute winner Good wine selection too and we rolled off feeling full happy as can be 
6sAK2LaQzyTP9DYfPAVkVg CMU The food is decent but overrated and overpriced for what you get I ve had friendly servers but my repeated horrible experiences with one of the hostesses has made me decide never to go back at least not when I see her in the window She s been very rude from the moment when we walked in One night a group of six of us came and had drinks entrees and dessert We had barely finished eating and were enjoying each others company and she was immediately lurking over our table with this horrible glare on her face looking at her watch clearly trying to tell us to get out There were no customers waiting for a table These experiences along with the prices has made me opt for more welcoming and less pretentious restaurants in the area 
6UH_3W0nqC9ySGB8decmNQ CMU The food quality really is a notch above anything else in the neighborhood Go for lunch or breakfast Blueberry pancakes are amazing and huge Turkey burger is good too I think dinner is a bit overpriced 
6wwvAc7JZeD7-g7EA_N5QQ CMU Yes I returned but not by choice My husband s cousin wanted to toast a special occassion and asked us to please meet her and her family there for dinner We couldn t decline as it was a sentimental affair I tried the penne salmon tonight and it was good tasty and a decent portion I tasted the mac cheese which was bland and a fail My husband had the NY strip it was average nothing special The fave seemed to be the calamari asian salad which has always been flavorful because of the necessary spices to pull of calling it asian My mine gripe from the previous reviews remains The servers are too lackadasical and not very well learned in the way of wines Our server didn t know what Veuve Cliquot was Really They should be trained properly Otherwise it was one star better and it probably had to do with the great company I had 
6ZJKrLazoEPxBPfNxiDJ_A CMU Brunch today Yummy turkey burger with chipoltle carmelized onions and cheese large beer and live music The service was prompt and solicitous The music was lively but you could still hear your companions talk All for 20 OK 19 would have been a 20 tip but why not keep the karma going on this beautiful sunny day 
73vUVDZM8RIIo0KV0vV-dQ CMU Food is good Prices are not Support the local Community and check it out This place is a few years too early for this hood Hope it can hod through 
74AFowom_jHDJ5y6cfqdwA CMU Community is one of my favorite upper west side spots I ve been there about five times and I m always happy I can t leave out though that one time I went there at 9 30 PM on a weeknight with a friend and they weren t serving dinner I thought that VERY strange for a NYC restaurant in a fairly hopping part of town also I believe the website said they served til 10 so it was very surprising Regardless their food is terrific I ve had the grilled chicken rice bowl the salmon rice bowl the breads spreads I ve also been there for brunch which I m not normally a fan of but it was totally fantastic I had a waffle with some sort of apple compote Not boring AT ALL Nice wine list good cappucino eclectic menu Friends have gotten the BLT and have been very happy Good service Oh and great cookie dessert plate if you re feeling extra naughty and decadent 
7BQ1hW6F04p7qYw-HI6lMA CMU I live locally and am so happy to have been introduced to this place My friend asked me to meet her here on a Monday night I couldn t believe what secrets were awaiting me A whole secret dinning room that was both rustic and cavernous The bartender was not only friendly but funny and welcoming We GUSHED over the stuffed mushrooms per the recommendation of the bartender We also had the Chef s tapas selection which included hummus cheeses prosciutto goat cheese stuffed dates blue cheese stuffed olives and fresh fruit YUM To drink I had the Sancerre and my friend had the Blue cheese olive martini The experience was not only enjoyable but affordable for the quality etc I WILL be returning As an American missing Europe this is my new escape 
7dOhlTWmmPV2aOqmLvq1rg CMU I miss AmCaf Prior to it s Upscale Renovation AmCaf was a bit divey but had good and reasonably priced pub grub and a really fun atmosphere It s where you could go for a drink a snack and a good time Then it became a more upscale restaurant with a martini bar I don t think it s a good fit for the area as the food isn t as good as other upscale places in the area and it s now overpriced for students The food is okay nothing to write home about But with few good pubs in the area AmCaf seems like it was better for the area before it became AmRaTL 
7E5b_rw7CVfHV6-kJqeXzQ CMU Lunch here is a treat especially on the outdoor patio on Broadway The ingredients were fresh and the portions were generous 
7FEpOhVcAwLSliEjcOuJtw CMU Toast was pretty good A couple of my bros live in the neighborhood so we went over for breakfast Menu and prices were about what you d expect I got a salmon eggs Benedict which was good except the salmon was REALLY cold It just sticks out in my mind At Schiller s it wasn t for some reason Kind of made it weird to eat My buddy s girlfriend got a BBQ pork sandwich that I finished Both were really really good Standard fare coffee etc The service was great and the bar looks pretty good This is a pretty chill place to just get a bite but I wouldn t go out of my way to come here if I wasn t in the neighborhood already Nothing special but really good food I guess is what I m trying to say 
7G1TMAbzb0i00utU68_opw CMU I haven t a bad thing to say about you Harlem Tavern I see that some people have been waaaay harsh to you You ve been nothing but kind and gentle to me so far I m choosing to stick with you until you let me down Your bouncer was very cordial to me and my guy when we arrived to celebrate a friend s Bday Thursday night When I told him that we were meeting friends he asked whether we knew they were inside or out When I told him I had no clue he said No problem go right ahead in Cool beans Your server was prompt to bring us drinks even though we came about 30 mins after everyone else had already started drinking I ordered some blueberry beer no good That was my fault though I think I was trying too hard to keep up with you being a beer place After I passed the beer to my friend who said it tasted like drinking a bagel I ordered a pina colada w a 151 floater Hot damn that floater made my throat burn I stirred it in and kept going Your server was funny and kept up with our 5 different drink orders Kudos to him Your outside garden is a lovely place to spend a summer evening My friends and I look forward to sharing many laughs with you If you surprise me with tasty food and a rockin happy hour I just might consider making you my one and only We ll see 
7IKIhjcURU6OvaHNQ5yK5Q CMU This place is F I L T H Y The floors look like they haven t been swept in months Think subway platform The interior has that distinctive dried puke smell that dimly lit pubs acquire over time The tables are sticky so think twice before putting your elbows down Every piece of furniture seems to wobble not a good idea for a place that sells hot beverages The edibles they sell look pale and stale It looks like management has simply given up This neighborhood is aching for a proper coffee place some would be Brooklyn coffee entrepreneur please look this way 
7ikP5TzCthEU0cAE6X8ZRQ CMU If I could give a 3 5 that would be my real vote The place has GREAT burgers It s beer selection is very interesting has almost one version of every type of beer so it s bound to please most but almost too obscure of a list I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich last time and it was pretty lame The service is always ok But overall it s a cute joint that I will return too but I think I ll stick with the burgers 
7Iu_K8KQQczj50ojBpY4Lw CMU Welcome back Community Food and Juice It s been a long few months without you 
7JCjbbFxQilCY12sKiwtEQ CMU Went here with my bf and another couple Decided to order food and the waitress was very nice and patient Food is priced decently Menu was ok not impressive but better than some Our party decided to go downstairs where there was music and umm interesting dancing or a sad excuse for it either way like I said interesting Mixed crowd acceptable music mostly r b and hip hop couple oldies mixed in Bathroom was clean major plus Watch out for stairs lol Probably wont be back 
7jefgjZ6KpSqe988_2L12Q CMU It s way overpriced the daily soup 10 and half full came with a cheese sandwich well size of a cracker and it was hard to find the cheese the coffee was bad Not my favorite 
7jEzFV9DiR_thtTbCbmfdg CMU Good beer selection good European beers as well as American microbrews so it satisfies everyone in the group great burgers and veggie burgers and a nice crowd of mostly grad students and a range of locals No outdoor seating unfortunately and the food is warm and comforting so it s probably best in the winter 
7oLYSMPbfZPD-ydsQILeyw CMU Went here for lunch The food was good but the service was mediocre It took our waitress a good ten minutes to greet us It was pretty busy and only two servers and a bus boy Don t come here if you want a quick lunch Otherwise my fries and Turkey Wrap were good 
7R1Xb_O13HCTn0fz0lfYeQ CMU I had spotted 5 and Diamond walking in my neighborhood about a month before going with a friend for their 5 specials I had the breaded macaroni balls They were super delicious and so fun to eat We ate at the bar which was a nice option and the service was confident and not overbearing like some of the other new restaurants opening in the area The decor was great and everyone looked gorgeous Its the kind of restaurant you want to be the first to bring others too maybe show off a great new necklace or hairdo as well A great new gem of Harlem 
7ru9QV-rnVUbC0tugGWzjg CMU Not great This location used to house Saurin Park which was a good neighborhood place to relax and have a coffee This new place has food which is just average and service to match The OJ was lukewarm and the bagel just ok Although they have fee Internet there are no plugs so watch your time before you are done In this neighborhood there is not much so this may be your best or only bet for early am coffee but it is just ok 
7shJ5MHyjXLCY2Y-ahBDgQ CMU Very cool bar in Harlem While it was hard to get the waiter s attention this is still a nice spot to come hang out and have a few drinks I live in the Bronx so it s nice to have something close to home 
7Sio7sbl4Gw4_jyoJVMD6A CMU The burgers here are pretty good and they have good sweet potato fries I tend to have a beer here and they always have an interesting variety I like the atmosphere relax low key and the service has always been really great This is a good place to hang out with friends in an informal way I would not recommend the desserts though I have had their desserts a few times and for some reason have not been impressed by them Stick to the burgers beer 
7t-jRtSfjM8tFmN3OZ4KGA CMU We enjoyed a group lunch and everyone was happy with their meals I had a great burger but was tempted by many of the menu items The place was filled with families college kids co workers a good mix They have a larger back area that can host a group ask about it 
7tRxe4eVvuhYtGUX8a3jZg CMU The RUDEST bartender at Cafe Amrita served me and my friends last night I will never go there again because of this It s really too bad too cause it looks super cute in there and it s great location The owner manager should know that they have really rude staff on hand 
7UT7OalOcD6NWLlxj_p_4g CMU The food and customer service are equally impressive at this Morningside Heights establishment I order from here often to cater events at Columbia and have never been disappointed The management always goes the extra mile to make sure we are satisfied with our entrees and has even tweaked the menu for us at times If it were less expensive I d have lunch here myself more often 
7V9OKndUtXaQMPGvw-7J0w CMU I just ate here the service was terrible I odered iced tea when I needed a refil my server wasn t available to get me another one The salad wasn t good either They add 20 tip to the check for the service which is terrible The prices for the food is way overpriced 
7WCcBisMED2c1rUrDhkRfg CMU Went on a Thursday night with a large group from work We were stuck in the corner booth behind the bar The drinks for the most part were weak The service was slow Several people started just going to the bar to order rather than waiting for the waitress to come over The food was extremely salty and not good Nothing stands out in my mind and we ordered quite a few appetizers from calamari to crab cakes I wouldn t go back just didn t have enough going for it for my tastes 
7x-MbFJ1InDRR0dJYlzmVg CMU Best outdoor space in the city Huge space plenty of umbrellas Love the size of the outside patio When I went it was very busy and few servers The wait staff wasn t rude Just not there Took forever to get water or to order The food was good Standard pub food Overall a great atmosphere and experience Recommend the turkey burger or fried chicken sandwich 
7x6yBhcZjAJ6SX_IyxQ1fQ CMU Food was alright drinks were ok atmosphere was real good our waitress Mona was the shit This place was pretty good 
7XSV8aAlqT_Kn6y5JG-lgw CMU My new favorite place to waste the day away over a book and multiple glasses of coffee or wine depending on how saucy I m feeling Sip is great really small but it s perfect They have a great menu and surprisingly delicious food I love the salads and they make a killer latte I was jazzed for hours The staff is super friendly and this is one of those places where if you become a regular the staff will be your new best friends I love it I went in on a Saturday afternoon to do some reading writing and immediately was told you need a glass of wine Not only do they categorize the wine by cheap and not cheap they give a ton of recommendations and i love that Also how gorgeous is this neighborhood I had no idea as this was my first time frequenting Manhatan Valley but i love it I just wish i could transplant this location further down but it really is gorgeous Central Park North is truly a little bit of heaven and a breath of fresh air from tourist infested Central Park South that has a Mickey Mantle s ew and the abused horses being forced to tote around tourists all day long Anyway i love Sip 
7y53X_mxIWE_AXLkMbTOIg CMU Had heard mixed reviews of the place before checking it out with a friend The menu was standard fare what my friend called the convenient but bland American place across the street After waiting around for a while for the waiter I ordered an eggplant panini I found myself needing to add ketchup for flavor if I was at a diner that would have been totally cool but the prices were definitely not diner prices A lot of better restaurants in the vicinity so this was my first and most likely last time at Amsterdam 
7zmB1iU9UeB8YtbLXvOu8Q CMU I will never go back to this place which sucks b c 1 I don t live too far from it 2 I really like the ambiance and decor My bf and I decided to check this place out since it s not too far from us We decided to meet there for happy hour and to watch the UM vs MSU game GO BLUE We decided to watch in the lounge on one of their several mini flat screens Just as we were about to step down into the lounge area we re greeted by a waiter who needed to take our coats mandatory coat check I m not a fan of checking my coat but we had no choice We find a table and chat for a while waiting for someone to bring us menus Um we waited for a good 10 minutes Apparently the waiter that took our coat was doing double duty and was rushing around to all the tables it wasn t crowded There were at least 4 tables seating areas with 3 4 people each The lounge is pretty spacious so at first glance it didn t seem to be a lot of people There were several people at the bar and the bartender was pretty busy so no help there My bf finally walked up to the bar and asked for menus We had read online that there were happy hour and tapa specials but the menus we got didn t mention anything about it The bartender finally comes over and asks what we d like We ask about the specials She looks through our menus then tells us to hold on She goes to another table to fetch a special menu She says she ll come back Keep in mind it s been about 20 minutes at this point and no real service has taken place The menu has TWO tapa specials Both of the tapas on the menu were variations of empanadas WTF Why have two types of empanadas on special and NOTHING else I looked at the main tapas menu and there were at least 20 different kinds I was so confused She came back and I said Are these the only tapas on specical She nodded yes and I couldn t help but to say Wow but you have such a big menu that s surprising there s only 2 on special She didn t reply ugh We ordered mojitos the nachos and chicken wings to start The mojitos had TONS of mint It was strong but way too much mint I had to fish it out w my fork The nachos were burnt I guess they make their own They tasted more like burnt dough and not tortilla chips The nachos also had ground beef on it which wasn t seasoned at all Ew Nothing like bland meat The chicken wings came out lukewarm and were super dry Overall the only good thing about this place is that we got to watch the game The service continued to suck since at one point I asked the waiter if I could have a glass of water He never brought it however he walked back over to our table to clear dishes Again wtf I take it he didn t understand me since we noticed his English was not up to par I m sorry not to be mean but if you re not a native English speaker and want to work in a place dealing with the public I m going to need you to learn English He later came back and we asked if there were drink specials He said No they end at 7p But that s not what the website said So when the bartender came back we asked her and she said the sangria and wine were still on special until 10pm What a bad experience all around Slow service the whole night mind you the place didn t really fill up except for the bar The food sucked Definitely will not be returning 
7zxjNlIm029Ad78-p0MV1Q CMU I ve heard a lot about Harlem Tavern and had to give it a try I don t think I will be back but not because it was horrible it just wasn t anything special It felt like The Pourhouse on Amsterdam and 109th but less personal Slightley less enganging staff as well I had a glass of prosecco and shared the beef sliders and quesadillas with my friends The food was fine again nothing to write home about but wasn t bad either I supposed I see the appeal for people who like sports but I am not one of them so I was less impressed It s a casual spot for a casual beer or happy hour drink Not really worth going out of the way for in my opinion 
7_93l8pBI5REzLZUzIfA1g CMU While I used to love Cafe Amrita because of the ambiance and the people who were the servers at night and for brunch I have to say that they do their brunch scene all wrong for when there s a game playing mostly for soccer euro football Boyfriend and I wanted to watch the Eurocup with some coffee beers delectable goodies and we were all Well Cafe Amrita usually has it playing it s like 3PM brunch should be ending now Lets goooo Upon arriving we noticed that there were two seats at the bar and we began to almost happily skip to them until we noticed the big sign that put a damper on our moods and our Soccer driven giddiness RESERVED For who you might ask No one Management puts a reserved sign up whenever there is a game and freely gives them away whenever they want to How do I know this Because some random bloke came into the cafe seemed to be just as puzzled as us at where to sit and the baristas were all Hey insert name of bloke need a chair and promptly sat him at the reserved section We even asked the waitress when did she think a table would open up anything open up and she was all well they re all here for the game which was sort and sort of not true since there were clearly people finishing up meals not paying attention to the screen We left in a haste and quickly went to Panini di Parma instead over on Amsterdam literally running up Morningside Drive to grab a stool Not cool Amrita Not cool Now I know why I shouldn t be coming for that coffee shop 
84QRQ2KXDkdkG7mkFnw36w CMU 3 5 stars My friends and I came and partook in this urban beer garden scene It was at first disconcerting to be right on a loud busy street corner but it ultimately made me realize how unique this large space was I wouldn t say there is much special about it in terms of decor or ambiance The beer selection was also large yet uninteresting However our waitress was perfectly nice and only a little transient A good summer stop 
86N3Aq_GvDaa9W9IVphlHg CMU This place would get a 5 if it only did dinner The prix fixe at 15 95 is so good I d go there once a week The service at night was great Even though the wait for the food was long I felt it was because there was only one guy in the kitchen and he was making each dish one at a time The food is great But the regular coffee pastries counter service during the day sucks 
8aO6ezB1JaGG2aJQsI0dZw CMU I walked past this place today with a friend and when we glanced over at people s food who were eating outside we both stopped and took a second glance and realized the food looked really good and that we should probably go inside We did indeed I had some of the best blueberry pancakes I ever had in my life My friend enjoyed her vegetarian sandwich I m excited to go back 
8CmQ5a6ZZJiyMo6VXmxfSw CMU Wow I m the first to review this place Cool Well I organized a group of friends to meet here for an evening of drinks and eats and conversation actually my Anti Valentine s Day celebration We were seated in the restaurant large group and we liked the look and feel of the place although it could be cozier Ultimately there were about 10 11 of us The drinks were mostly outstanding great Key Lime Pie martini and the Coco jito was fab as well and the food was pretty good My roommate had the Media Noche and felt that the pork could have been better and that it was rather dry and was lacking the cheese and that the Cheese Steak Egg Rolls should have had cheese IN them rather than just in the dipping sauce She s a chef with pretty high standards but I got the Pernil Napoleon great idea good execution and agree that the pork really had no flavor which is unforgivable for something labeled Pernil Should be brimming with flavor Didn t hear any complaints about the other food ordered I also did the sliders which were lovely and well presented I think some of the other things were Albondiga Meatballs Bruschetta Parmesan Spinach Artichoke Dip Saganaki and the Mediterranean Spreads All in all we liked the place The waitress was a little abrupt here and there and the place wasn t THAT busy but the hostess was delightful and they handled the final checkout very well and with much patience I do want to return to try the Lounge downstairs and to have a full scale dinner I ll re post when I do 
8D7E6Cjgm3b2trgUXsXdiQ CMU Chicken Apple Rosemary Sausage 7 Grain Waffle The Waffle come with brown sugar not honey so it is still crispy when I finish it The dried apple is not too sweet nor sour The best waffle I ve had There are also some almond I feel so healthy I saw someone at next table eating biscuit sandwich It looks sooooo delicious Latte is great but next time I will try my friend s recommandation of Cranberry Margarita and Wasabi Hari Mari 
8KF733tVRUOHf7voCAjHEw CMU I had walked by HFB prior to dining there liked the vibe and atmosphere and looked forward to spending my time and money at a local establishment However the actual experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I decided to write a Yelp review to make others aware of the situation they were walking into Our experience started pleasantly enough with the kind and polite hostess greeting us and quoting a table wait time that was far longer than in reality We sat and were soon greeted by our waiter who was friendly but a bit less polished than we d expected Nonetheless he was polite and attentive so all was well We ordered an appetizer for the table to share as well as drinks for 2 out of 3 patrons 30 minutes and a not so packed restaurant later we had no appetizer I asked the waiter who seemed to often be standing around not doing much when we could expect the food and he said don t worry its coming 10 minutes later Sorry everything is backed up The kitchen just asked about your food so I know its coming I m not sure why the kitchen would ask the waiter about our food but we assumed the restaurant was still working out kinks so we let it go 45 minutes after ordering we were brought the macaroni and cheese bites appetizer and were dismayed to find three blocks of deep fried breaded food It didn t seem like the type of item that took more than 5 minutes to make and it wasn t explained why it instead took 9x that amount of time We ate the appetizer though we were unimpressed When the waiter came to clear our plate a woman in our party said Can I tell you something Those weren t worth the wait politely That s it I jumped in and said yeah they weren t very flavorful The waiter apologized and we told him that we just wanted to give them feedback as they were a new restaurant 15 minutes later we got our meals though they messed up my order and brought cold fries with another We didn t complain finished our meals and were surprised when the waiter brought free drinks for the two of us that were drinking as an apology for the appetizer We accepted them but assured him that we didn t need any compensation and were just giving feedback He then approached the third person who wasn t and said I only have a two drink maximum Sorry I can t bring you anything When we asked who set the maximum he responded that the bartender did We replied that since the three of us shared the appetizer something comping all of us would be more appropriate than drinks for the two patrons but that we didn t need freebies anyway so not to worry about it Again general commentary Well we were quite surprised when the owner came up to our table and loudly and defensively asked us what was wrong with the macaroni and cheese bites and why we didn t like them Surprised we repeated that we wanted to give feedback and that we thought they could use more flavor He again loudly and defensively said that he was surprised since everybody likes them and that in fact he was making them for an event for Harlem Week completely oblivious to our distaste and the looks of surprise from other patrons He left our table abruptly at which time the table behind us leaned in and shared that they didn t like said appetizer either and in fact that the food overall was quite forgettable and commented on the inappropriate reaction of the owner We thought it had ended there but five minutes later Owner s back I really can t believe you didn t like that dish Nobody else has ever said that We commented that maybe they just hadn t told him or that we were the only ones who felt that way but again pointed out that we just wanted to give a new business useful feedback He then quite inappropriately said Well I mean you finished it You ate it all So I m not sure what that s about At this point I was fed up I told him that we never said the food was awful just that we thought it needed more flavor and never asked for compensation We went on to tell him that in general we thought the food was a bit bland but again were just giving constructive criticism To which he retorted well I ll take that under construction and offered to remove the appetizer from the bill We said it was fine didn t mind paying for it and left Needless to say I won t be back The food was nothing to write home about but decent The service was forgivable given the place is in its early days The owner s behavior however was not I ll give my hard earned money to another place Long review but you ve been warned 
8kig0KaIOH-gEG6Sk_1TiQ CMU Nice place if your single 
8k_doiz3PTj1CwslYdrhKg CMU This place sucks so bad that I m starting a review while I m still here DO NOT EAT HERE IF I COULD RATE IT ZERO STARS I WOULD Why Because Horrible service Rotting yellowing slimy lettuce Hair on plate Cold coffee then returned too hot to drink coffee running down the sides as if it had been microwaved for several minutes plunked on the table with no comment Horrible service all food check etc was plunked on the table with no comment no check back cold eggs ok slightly lukewarm as if reheated Dirty condiment containers All the food tasted like three day old leftovers dried rubbery potatoes chewy rubbery omelette you could bounce the French toast Did I say horrible service The water was good and the glasses were clean The busser was somewhat attentive and seemed kind but inept The only reason I ate at all is because I was starving and I didn t have time or money to wait in line at the Kitchenette Seriously I know it s hard to be picky about breakfast in this neighborhood because it s all basically subpar but this place made the Deluxe seem fancy and Tom s gourmet I d rather have diner gut from greasy eggs anyday at least they re served hot I m actually depressed after eating here and dealing with such an obviously hateful server who needs to work somewhere where she doesn t have to talk to people Wow That sucked 
8LLfRVYIRi1JlQqFYJnyww CMU All in all a good brunch But not worth the cost Personally I feel local vs organic is an even trade environmentally and nutritionally They could trim some cost by going local over organic and pass that on to the customer They don t want to hear it from me But I digress on to the review This was my first time here I d heard about the wait and I was ready to wait We were seated in under 10 minutes Timing is everything Very nice We sat at a great corner table in the back room Clean cozy atmosphere people with kids were all under control Very nice The service was good it took a while to get drinks Not so nice but okay we re new here Rule 1 at brunch get the water coffee and juice down quick The rest can come whenever The food was very good I had the litmus test for any brunch establishment The Eggs Benedict classic hollandaise North Country Canadian bacon whole wheat buttermilk Biscuit Hollandaise was fresh the egg was runny all good so far My wife had the Brioche French Toast mixed berries house made lemon curd warm maple butter at the recommendation of our waiter and she was very happy with her order We shared some sides we were starving and we tend to over order in a new place to test the waters The Double Cut Bacon was just okay maybe 1 5 cut and the Hash Browns were not revolutionary All good but nothing mind blowing What I was really hoping to be mind blowing was the Prairie Mary organic Prairie vodka house made bloody mary mix and celery stalk served tall If you re going to have a signature or special drink make it so good that the custy wants another It was just okay maybe it needed another shot of voddy but I had time for and usually have but declined another I would go back if the whole thing wasn t almost 80 bucks That s twice what brunch at Isabella s or Ocean grill costs and the food is comparable 
8LVjImx08V-nb93V8L9L0A CMU I have been wanting to check out this place for brunch for a while and finally did so today The wait was pretty intimidating 30 45 minutes but I m glad we hung around because we only actually waited around 15 minutes The service was quick and efficient We didn t have the most pleasant server but my water glass stayed full and he took our order and delivered our food in a very timely manner Now for the food I got the Truffled quiche and I loved every bite of it It had a very different texture than I am used to very creamy and gooey but it complimented the flaky crust perfectly The salad it came with was simply lettuce and they were not so fresh I would have loved some cherry tomatoes in there My sister got the sausage and eggs I tried some and loved the sausage but she found it a little too sweet The potato carrot hash was 98 potato I have been here before for lunch and ordered this side and I remembered it being much more flavorful and with a lot more carrot so it was disappointing However the biggest faux pas of the meal was my sister s eggs she ordered them scrambled and they came undercooked which made them repulsive and inedible It was busy but for a place that is so expensive and popular for brunch it s kind of unfathomable they would mess up something so simple Overall the food averaged out to good the coffee was strong and tasty and there is a lot more on the menu we want to try so we will be going back just looking for more consistent quality 
8LWKR4IPHriA4VaTVjVazg CMU I had heard such wonderful things about this place and after coming here both for dinner and brunch I ve gotten a 360 view They have a wonderful selection of organic and local beers to start off with I didn t try the cocktails but they were tempting to say the least In fact they have a lot of local and sustainable fair on the menu which is always very nice I had a delicious salmon and fried potato salad over a bed of parsley which just blew my mind I m not a huge salad person but I left feeling very full I came here a few days later for brunch We managed to snag a table in the shade outside the wait for an indoor table looked long but not all tables are shaded so watch out on a hot summer day We saw several B E L T s walk by bacon lettuce tomato and egg on sourdough yum But I opted for a more traditional house made apple sausage and eggs with carrot hashbrowns Filling and delicious My friend had the blueberry pancakes which came with a syrup that tasted like brown sugar and butter So decadent and so good The service was great both times The waiters quickly came by and so did our food I will be eating here whenever I get the chance 
8MfEpG9QuTaPhZpAlWS13A CMU Love it Great food great ambiance great drinks quick service and great location close to my job and home 
8ov3SqWdVtm5edIzjBqjAQ CMU Hmm surprised to see this place rated so low I suppose I understand the price point being high for the neighborhood but the food quality and portions justified the prices IMO We had a great experience here I thought the food was delicious and had no gripes with the service We were quite a large party of over 10 ppl with no reservations on a Sunday night We did apps and drinks at the bar and then had dinner in their private room as it was a slow night My gf and I shared the calamari app which was huge and really delicious and then the miso salmon entree which was also really excellent No one at the table had complaints about their meals or drinks and the bite I had of a friend s dessert was also delicious Two thumbs up from me 
8oYyC1roXLQF7P9OR5d7bg CMU Great crowd Good drinks Awesome outdoor space Food is hit or miss Stick to the basics Great for people watching Right by the subway An excellent place to hang out on a nice day 
8sHY-7pfDlGTp1M9YhvC2g CMU This is the kind of brunch place that I thought existed only in my minds eye version of the Upper West Side Yes the wait feels long but it is very short for Manhattan and yes you must spend it shoulder to shoulder with dozens of cool people who seem to have gotten out of bed significantly better groomed than you but by being here maybe you are one of those cool people but most importantly the food is quite good I ve gotten the biscuit sandwich and the sausage eggs both of which were extremely tasty and satisfying though also very rich I almost regret that the savory dishes are so good that I can never be tempted into something sweet like that brioche french toast But I guess that s what sharing is for I haven t had it yet but I m already dreaming of the burger 
8sqTddT_1ZlXMNhlj5Sqcg CMU I came here late at night prior to closing with a friend who was on a raw food diet She ended up with a salad and I got the organic salmon Oh my It was amazing They fried the salmon skin to a thin crisp and seasoned it well So good And the salmon was done perfectly Moist and slightly pink in the center it sat on top of some noodles and a broth I would have liked a thicker broth something meat based but that s ok I m surprised they could whip together my dish in such a short period of time and the quality of the food did not decline closer to closing I will have to try this place a couple more times to make a sound decision but so far so good 
8sWztQbBpgD5JKTypKsMPA CMU Good atmosphere where the grown folks music plays softly in the background Typical 11 coctails and 12 angus hamburgers with cheese and grilled onions Sweet potato fries were hot and delicious i would recommend this place to my friends k 
8VDOBtl65Dyi98Q-SAgi_A CMU May 1 2011 We went to brunch this morning with a cousin from out of town Our son lives on W 123rd so it was convenient Smoked salmon eggs benedict was cold and soggy but after waiting almost 45 minutes I was hungry Big mistake suffered a really bad upset stomach later My husband ordered French toast which was served COLD and when he sent it back it was returned to the table still cold We have eaten there before and knew the service was S L O W but today was the worst We will not go back McDonalds would have been better 
8WF4mErPe1j0sb3TnscE2w CMU My husband and I wanted to venture out of the usual UWS restaurants we frequent so we headed to Harlem Tavern The space is beautiful and really surprised us We ordered the Oysters Wedge Salad Burger and Steak Overall great night out and if we were uptown again we would stop by 
8XdMgIw-E7YVjJHn4llXVA CMU We live a block away and always passed by this place One night we ventured in and it was a delight The beers that we had were amazing and due to their great selection we were able to try a variety throughout the night Their wine was also very good I had a rose but the glass was fairly empty for the price I paid The service was good the lady was very warm and had great energy The food was very good I had the grassfed burger my boyfriend had the fried chicken and his friend had the duck burger They were all outstanding my only complaint would be the salad they served on the side It didn t have any dressing and consisted of lettuce that s all Not very great ambiance if you are sitting by the windows but inside is very tasteful A great place to eat in the neighborhood 
8YHt8sLizFo_i2XZX0YAIg CMU Oh Toast I used to love you Then you had some staff rotations that left service a bit spotty The food is still delicious and the staff are always polite Honestly I don t think it s their fault There just really needs to be more people working during brunch hours so that customers don t wait say 15 minutes before being offered water and a menu On the other hand I brought an out of town guest here last year and she proclaimed after eating her vegetable quiche that it was the best brunch I ve ever had One more note Toast has a ridiculous policy that says parties of two cannot be seated at four tops under any circumstances This has led to me and my boyfriend having to wait for a table even though there were one or more available Or I should say we were ASKED to wait for a table There are too many decent restaurants in the neighborhood for me to be willing to sit around and wait when there are empty tables four seaters at the ready 
91NoyWzCcVM0hLkp-Ev4Tw CMU This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city Their brunch is amazing I had the french toast with caramelized bananas and pecans and it comes with this amazing maple butter that Clinton St Baking Co also has which is just simply HEAVEN SOOOOO good For dinner you can never go wrong with the rice bowl Also had the burger which was deelish I can t give this place enough stars They rock my world They had a kitchen fire about 6 weeks ago and still haven t re opened sadly Cant wait until they re open again 
92qgDS2kfNinQ6VU49xrlg CMU Biz cas food with mind blowingly slow service and suburban decor wasting a perfectly good spot right next to where I work Maybe you won t be pissed if you are visiting Columbia and your company is going to reimburse you for your terrible meal but man stand up for yourself So fine there are plenty of bad biz cas restaurants out there I was willing to just ignore Amsterdam Restaurant until I got pulled there for some drinks with friends I ordered a 6 pint of Weihenstephan and it came in a falsie Sweet thanks for screwing me out of the extra 2 ounces and not cleaning your beer lines properly If you really need to eat right on Amsterdam then walk up another block to Haakon s Hall I may have mixed feelings about HH but the food is hands down and obviously more inspired there 
951h81XVB_3vgfwc5X3UQg CMU One of the problems of doing your master s part time is that you barely get enough time to hang out with the cool people you meet in your program However sometimes my classmates and I make it a point to hang out because the whole point of going to school is to meet people Right Screw the degree it s all about the people Anyways this week after one of my classes my classmates and I decided to hang out and we came here It is a really large space nice decor and lighting It wasn t too full on a Wednesday night but there was a comfortable buzz We snagged a table by the bar area and decided to get one of their 1 2 price bottles of wine and some appetizers The apps were OK the wine was a nice Chianti and the service was with a smile if a little persistent I think that this might be a good place to come after a long day of work and school A OK 
95fBWSvgbVsSg8bNp2aBUQ CMU Ok so I m really not a fan of their breakfast see previous post but their lunch and dinner are really good The soft shell crab sandwich is really really good so is the duck prosciutto sandwich So the food is decent but the service is an embarrassment still 
97qfJ6rqXKbq9ZXPEVpA2Q CMU I watched this place developing for a couple of months as I walked to the Cathedral Parkway subway stop every morning so I couldn t wait to try it when it opened But then it opened and I waited to try it something about the idea of preview days that just makes me a little nervous Oh what a mistake I should have gone in the first day and then eaten there every day thereafter for the rest of my life The wine list is short for wines by the glass but perfect The menu is just right seasonal fresh and simple trout with smoked black beans anyone The dessert was exactly the opposite in the best sense complicated creative innovative Whoever is back there whipping up the sweets is doing us all a public service And as the icing on the cake the odds and ends and so much more than odds and ends the cheese selection is absurd and the mac and cheese appetizer was making mac and cheese brand new for me potato pasta maybe Final analysis I love that it s in my neighborhood but this is food that I would travel for regardless 
9A69TFFDDP-QXVKi_S5vIQ CMU My wife and I have been going here for years It s definitely one of the better places in the neighborhood and a particularly nice brunch spot The menu selection is respectable and the quality is quite high for bistro food The service can be a bit inconsistent at times but it s generally positive The place tends not to be overrun with undergrads like many nearby on Broadway The burgers are great superb quality and the mussels are wonderful both are reasonably priced with sizable portions I used to be a big fan of the steak frites but they recently changed it from a beef tenderloin cut to a flat iron steak not my favorite Also good are the pasta sausage dish as a dinner entree and the corned beef hash for brunch Some dishes are definitely better than others although there are no bad choices Bistro 1018 is a solid 3 star place I give it 4 stars because it s one of the better options in Morningside Heights 
9aQd2t4-k_B6925jImvFqQ CMU NO THANKS In case you were wondering whether or not customer service is a luxury try Radio Perfecto Answer yes My friend and I walked in last night after not seeing each other for quite some time We sit down and wait a bit for service A moderately friendly bartender comes over takes our order and serves us up We were there before 7 and it wasn t too full Around 6 45 people started coming in individually every other minute How do I know Because the door stayed open for a good 30 seconds after each person came in bringing in the crisp December air That was uncomfortable Don t worry discomfort continues A man in a khaki suit eating dinner on his own next to us is watching the game We continue to carry on our conversation and he decides to interject and buy us drinks I said sure but my friend wasn t so up for it Eventually she gave in and the guy tells us to never say no Hmmm that s not what my feminist theory teacher at Columbia taught me but OK moving on It was a sweet gesture yes He continues to watch the game and as I said in the beginning since I have not seen my friend in a while we kept chatting it up No qualms we exchanged thank you s and your weclome s SUDDENLY This one short hipster esque bartender kept giving my friend and I an attitude for the remainder of our stay and I have no idea why And he was deliberately being friendly with everyone else at the bar Could it have been that I asked for an extra dirty martini and he gave me a simple martini and I called him out I just wanted my drink Maybe he thought we were using the guy Except that my friend tried turning down the drink and the guy wasn t trying to talk to us Was it my hair I like other Yelpers and techinically everyone else do not like wasting money and especially not giving it to a jerk I felt completely disrespected and offended by Mr Randy Grinchy Scrooge NO MORE RADIO PERFECTO 
9b05J8aRDUR8bfoNzjTtSQ CMU The rice bowl is the freshest healthiest and tastiest menu offering in a 1 2 mile radius Your whole body feels better for it They also have a great breakfast brunch menu The only and main downside to this place is that sometimes the waitstaff is really awkward I ve had to flag them down almost every visit for basic things like salt butter and jam or drinks and a check It gets really annoying like they don t know to follow up on tables But if you can put up with that the food is a pleasure Nice outdoor seating in on Broadway Another downside is that they don t do delivery or carry out Which is a bummer when their staff is awkward But hey like I said oh that heavenly rice bowl 
9F4FkPOw3df8yql-BEDebw CMU I love Cafe Bagutta Disregard what the other reviews say about this place not being a spot to relax enjoy tea finish a paper it is definitely that place In fact I was there for about 3 hours one day and ordered a latte one the best I have had in the city by the way and the waiter came over to bring me a cookie on the house because he could tell I was working hard That being said this is definitely not a place for a really quick bite in and out in 20 minutes but for me that is part of the charm If you have a little bit more time and are able to enjoy a nice lunch or coffee this is your place Also their carrot ginger soup and lentil soup are to die for The service is personable and the food is good and well priced Fantastic 
9gJ9wuaa2_IScE3TVyhM4w CMU Great place to go for happy hour The beer selection is nice and the specials are usually good The food on the other hand not so nice Stick to normal bar food items and you should be ok 
9HJORQqlAZJrbasSTpZoTg CMU We stopped in there on one of the most sweltering August days of the year The A C was blowing and we got a nice table for two and our server was prompt to bring us some ice cold glasses of water They had a delicious chilled apple saucey soup that was very unique and tasty and given the heat we just went with their special salad and a mediterranean plate Prices were reasonable for NYC the atmosphere was very pleasant the service was prompt and professional We ll be sure to go back when they have the fire place going in January of course 
9hJSqaHKk5YrodNUfwSZLg CMU Why would a Tavern NOT have wings and pitchers of beers Food is so so staff is a bit pushy and don t let you enjoy your drinks or time beers are expensive and I honestly expected a lot more from them Their menu is super limited and don t offer much Hopefully they ll get it together soon I ll give them another try in the next couple of months stay tuned 
9iSrrVpnbPtwQ6MJOPQjdA CMU Nice atmosphere good service tasty food I went here last week for my friend s birthday It was a large party about 15 of friends and family When you enter the establishment there is a full bar on your left and several tables on your right I didn t see much of the place because apparently my friend had reservations or something and we were promptly escorted to a secluded room off to the side The decor in this room was very classy The perimeter of the room was lined with couches There were tables and upholstered stools to match the couches The service was a little slow but not terrible for such a large party and it being a Friday evening I shared a pitcher of Sangria It was very good but you might want to ask for lite fruit similar to requesting lite ice The pitcher was supposed to supply four glasses Due to the fruit is was more like three 3 4 full glasses The waiter noticed our disappointment and brought out another pitcher free of charge Others in my party had alcoholic drinks and said that they were nice and strong As you see from the photos the food presentation was appealing All of the portions from appetizers to entr es were a good size I had the spare ribs and sweet potato fries The ribs were tender and well done I heard no complaints from the others at my table besides being too full to finish their meal No one did dessert The birthday girl s mom brought a cake The food and drinks are not cheap That pitcher of sangria was around 20 and the entr es averaged about 20 25 bucks Of course there s also tax and gratuity applied Not cheap but it is what it is Not the worse I ve seen Harlem real estate IS getting pricey these days I read some of the comments on here before and after I went to Chocolat Maybe I just got lucky because everyone said they enjoyed their time there I would certainly go back I ll just have to save up my pennies first 
9N9IMhlwACFnz78xWwpGSg CMU They seem to have slipped a bit in quality lately both food and service wise On a recent evening I had a strip steak that was as tough as shoe leather The heirloom tomato appetizer had tomatoes that were so unripe that they were nearly inedible I sent the dish back without requesting a replacement After the meal we waited so long for the check having asked for it that I finally went inside and buttonholed a different waiter so we could settle up and leave A real downturn compared to my other experiences here 
9nexKsF4fpqf5p3MftGZPw CMU While you wouldn t expect a place like this on one of the more raw stretches of Amsterdam Bistro 1018 takes its food and drink very seriously and prices itself accordingly The service is very attentive knowledgeable and usually cute to boot I haven t had a dissapointing meal yet 
9nF-nIonaA_TvLURMl2VJg CMU I love Community Food Juice It s closer to me owned by the same people as Clinton St shorter wait times and cheaper Can t get much better Delightful pancakes waffles French Toast served with their special maple butter Always a winning combo This is the only way I trick people into coming up to where I m at to visit and hang out Thank you Community It s one brunch spot I don t have to wake up super early to get to 
9NYxXLRNhwhU2ofE4tDA8w CMU squee Both times I ve been there I got that thing that has two eggs bacon and carrot hash browns yeah that s what I said and a biscuit Don t get scrambled eggs Honestly I m in it all for the biscuit which is worth five stars all by its cute little self As soon as your plate comes ask for butter and jam Then split it open put the butter in close it back and don t touch it until you re finished Then with all the butter having melted but the outside still crunchy dump jam on each half Eat the top part first Then cut the bottom in half and give the rest to your gay best friend who is checking out the waiter 
9onm1IQ1vx2szBRSOVmeuQ CMU Now that I have had a chance to check this out I hate to be brutually honest but for the price point and the menu descriptions I would expect the food to taste better than what I had The Cheeseburger was an incredible let down and I have had better at Corner Bistro 6 50 I know everyone wants to treat Harlem like it s a West Village and it s already annoying enough that people who live around Chocolat call the area SOHA really folks but seriously if you are going to offer certain price points you have to stand up to it I wouldn t come here again unless someone else was paying and if I wanted a real upscale experience in Harlem I would head over to Red Rooster on Lenox Now that s worth your money 
9qqa4w34k11IVxDZ2Mb6BA CMU The decor is nothing fancy which is its charm Good food and you will almost faint when you see the prices Am I still in NYC Yes Virginia it is possible to eat for under 10 Full bar too for those of you partaking 
9QUwB8tH4L3kBI7d7PLmWQ CMU Although the bartender was very pleasant and personal I thought this spot needed alot of work in terms of staffing The white sangria I ordered was spoiled I think they should have offered a complimentary drink for the spoiled drink After my husband and I had made dinner reservations for 4 PM when we arrived at 3 40 we were told we would be seated at our tables at 4PM as that was when the menu would change from brunch to dinner At 4 09 while sitting at the bar we were told dinner would not be served till 4 30 Because I had to reorder another drink the Rum Drizzle was delicious and the appetizer the calamari very tasty and light i had no problem with the wait but by the time we ordered and received our food the we were disappointed The Salmon and Bok Choy my husband ordered was not presented in an inviting manner with a side of white rice and had a lot to be desired in terms of taste When we asked for lemon for the salmon the waiter bought slices of lemon from the bar on a paper napkin Who does that My chicken salad was ok although the chicken was extremely dry and had no taste The overall was a let down The restaurant is not cheap and having the staff trained properly should be a must on their to do list As a bar it is nice but for a dinner I am not sure if I will go back 
9T4WWITIgxYFfcQmoeQrlg CMU Feeling tired of the bars around Columbia I decided to give Sip a chance At first it seemed great some of us wanted food others coffee and dessert still others booze Sip accommodated us all The music and atmosphere was conducive to friends gathering and talking which was what we wanted Then came the problems When it was time to leave the server came over and apologetically said that their computer system was down He then said that he could compute the bill manually but that he preferred not to could we just remember how much we paid and then pay in cash I found it odd that he couldn t compute the bill manually do they not have a backup calcuator in the place and that somehow this became our responsibility Nonetheless because we were anxious to leave we started working backward and came up with a total In the middle of this though the server reappeared and asked us for our patience the computer would start working again soon So we waited about 40 more minutes for the computer to work Didn t happen Then the server came over and said that we owed about 20 dollars more than we thought unnecessarily adding there was a lot of booze which there wasn t maybe a total of five glasses of wine among six people When we asked for an itemized list he again groaned and said that it was too hard to remember Are we that dependent on computers nowadays that we can t keep track of a few glasses of wine and desserts As it turned out the extra money came on two extra glasses of wine I had ordered I ordered a cheap glass their words for 6 and when I ordered two additional ones I expected them to bring me more of the cheap Instead they brought me the more expensive 9 glasses without being asked Realizing this I protested but was told that I had to specify that I wanted to continue drinking the cheap wine Like there s a default setting on wine or whatever So sorry Sip Gave you a shot and you blew it Back to 1020 and the local dives where at least they re honest 
9Ui9-bVz8vq9tPZL2hDZbw CMU I really enjoyed this place Its small and cute Located right on Harlem s Restaurant Row The Happy hour was very tasty and priced well 5 drinks and food I had the sangria pear bellini very good I also had the mac and Cheese Yum and Wings average but good 
9uUDAMy1bHxMb26DYfCkUA CMU Had such high hopes for this place It s visually interesting the menu selection looks good and there s a decent wine and cocktail list How can they possibly screw it up Here s how 1 WAY overpriced food The burger and fries is the best deal on the menu but if you re looking for something else you re out of luck 12 for a basic run of the mill ceasar salad I mean if it was a real one with anchovies good parm and freshly made dressing maybe but it s not 10 for wings We got 8 pretty small wings last time we ordered them And I don t normally order wings so for me to notice how small they were is saying something Seriously 6 for French Fries By their calculation their burger is worth the same as the fries since the combo is 12 Etc The prices are just off There s no rhyme or reason to them 2 Service Food takes forever to arrive but the place is never that busy And unlike Jado where there s only a couple of overworked servers and a packed house every day this place has double the wait staff for half the guests And yet slow food no follow up to see if you need anything else and the bartender would rather chat with friends than do his job Lest you write me off let me assure you that I have no problem spending money on a good meal I don t think Bad Horse is overpriced and I will happily and regularly spend way more than I care to admit at Jado or Lido or Cedric But this food just isn t worth it I m thrilled when a new option opens up here just like everyone else but it s insulting when they think they can gouge you just because the clientele up here is aching for new places Downtown isn t THAT far away guys 
9wIgpOi_h33xpT-CL6EgAA CMU Ok so sometimes I start reviews and get distracted and that s what happened here By the time I had returned to finish this review I had gotten a job at Toast because I liked being there so much What does that tell you about this place Mondays go there 5 Toast burgers when you buy a pint of one of their delicious beers Can you give me a reason not to Oh and they have 2 TWO Happy Hours Every day Two 
9x3Ebw7hHwIk18XGTFgfvw CMU I was a little hesitant about going to this place since I had read several negative reviews I m glad I went because I really enjoyed the food and the experience We arrived around 12 30 and only had to wait for ten minutes for a table of three I ordered the special chocolate chip pancakes They ARE all the rave delicious My friends had the country breakfast and omelet and they both seemed to have enjoyed their meals Get a side order of chorizo yummy I will be back 
9Xi3wfkdbcip4ic8k4fI9A CMU My go to place for dates while I was going to Columbia The food is great and so are the drinks try the sangria or the mojitos The prices arent bad either 
9z2iCz3ff2IMWG_5DlmJnQ CMU So after two years of basically living a couple blocks away from SIP I decided to give it a try and was totally disappointed First I tried ordering two things on the menu both were associated with the happy hour and they were out of both of them Really you are out of the two random things I pick that are the cheapest on the menu Of course a more expensive item was recommended to replace what I had asked for Second We also had to repeatedly ask for our free tapas that went along with happy hour that came out really late afterward Although I did enjoy my beverage third choice was a charm my experience was disrupted by constantly trying to get the waiter s attention Third The AUTOMATIC SURCHARGE of 18 sealed the deal for me that this place was a one timer Honestly we just had two drinks and had an 18 charge on our bill The bill also gives you advice on what more you can tip below different percentages with different prices If I didn t look close enough I would not have realized I was already charged for the tip I have never been to a restaurant that does this anywhere else ever there was only 2 of us and we just had drinks NICE TRY SIP never again Full stop 
9zUwcu3AYMOGNP45-kZgiw CMU This spot is like a local beauty queen Very pretty but lacking in substance and way too expensive First the good it is a pretty room Our server was very nice The rib appetizer was delicious and the meat fell off the bone That s the end of the good Plenty of bad We sat down in a nearly empty room at 2 30 on a Sunday But the lunch menu was not available We could get brunch or DINNER They serve bread during dinner But if you order dinner on the weekend you can t have bread Who s on first At least everything came out quickly I ordered a cocktail I love a good cocktail Too bad I didn t get one At 14 a pop they should have revealed that they were not capable of making what I ordered because they did not have the ingredients Let ME decide if I want a modified version The main missing ingredient was something they could have bought in a grocery store They even admitted they knew in advance that they were out but did not try to obtain it Then I went to one of the 3 separate bathrooms I won t tell you what was on display in the toilet of the 1st one I went to the last bathroom but the lock was broken Having already activated the launch sequence I had to take my chances I used that facility anyway But then I tried to wash my hands There was no soap coming out of the dispenser It made me wonder about where the staff washed their hands As we were putting on our coats to leave I spoke to the person who turned out to be the manager He had been standing there watching when I brought my cocktail back to the bar to complain but he had made no effort to address or even acknowledge the issue So imagine my surprise to find out he was a mgr He said he was immensely sorry about everything He offered to buy a drink or dessert but I was driving and full so I declined Raincheck When you are in an off brand neighborhood and charge entree prices for appetizers and 14 for cocktails your game needs to be much tighter than that BTW Brunch was very expensive about 22 for my seafood omlet with just OK ingredients and no extras No mimosas no bread no nothing I know they are relatively new but this death by a thousand papercuts At least the food wasn t bad Nothing special Entree portions are moderate but the rib appetizer was generous Sweet potato fries were well made 
9_J5yAodD9YJAotyQ4AcPQ CMU Excellent five stars healthy happy hippie food The mussels the beets the matzah ball soup were all great 
A-MXEQkAJzYL_Fk0Ki84fQ CMU Came here on a Friday night not to crowded Food was good I had the salmon with asparagus Drinks were ok too Good place to watch the game and chill 
a-mymtp2M5WWDjt1fGNjdw CMU Since I wrote my original review we have returned here for brunch lunch and dinner All the meals have been fantastic They have some really great cocktails and my favorite dinner entree is the shrimp grits I can t recommend this place enough Definitely my favorite in the neighborhood 
A2gmmon0xdzCAb1BhBNVeA CMU Dare I say it but was Nacho s Kitchen better than this place that replaced it No I would never say that Nacho s Kitchen was an entirely new level of terribleness When I came back from the summer and saw that it was being replaced I was excited to say the least Could we finally have a great place to eat on that strip on Broadway But that was not the case My wife and I went here after it opened allowing enough time for them to get the problems solved early on and were both underwhelmed The salad that she had could have been gotten at the Heights for half the price with the same level of taste My fish was about as bland as fish can get less NYC more Applebee s In addition the prices are certainly above student levels It was nice to know that my wife and I could get dinner and a drink at Nacho s for 25 even if the food was terrible Here the food is still lousy but tack another 15 onto the bill No thanks I ll pass 
a36HH08F1OoBZzRgLuPsyQ CMU I went to 5 Diamond for brunch with my book club this past Saturday 1 7 11 I had the Chicken Waffles I ve had better waffles from the frozen food aisle at Shoprite The fried chicken however was SLAMMIN I also had a side of the Mac Cheese The quantity was SKIMPY but the taste was SUPERB The venue is SMALL and it was not crowded while we were there The waiter was SLOW and SLOPPY The service really SUCKED SUCKY service and SO SO food was my first time experience at 5 D so it is highly unlikely that there will be a SECOND experience for me 
a3PYiCsHQ4M2amxfaBBy5Q CMU Nothing special at all really If you look at the menu and website this seems to be self proclaimed semi upscale fare If you look at my receipt just uploaded photo I paid 20 for a steak and 5 each for two beers What I can compliment is the fact that they carry Weinstephaner a better German wheat beer Yet it is common A better choice would have been Paulaner on draft The reason I ordered the Steak Frites Bourbon Glazed Flat Iron Steak Pommes Frites was in a faint hope that it might compare to the Steak Frites at Hopleaf in Chicago Nope Not even a glimpse of a chance of being in the same arena on game day I guess this is typical for New York City 
a5b_YhHntjOVs5lMjaow_A CMU Had brunch here today and really enjoyed the service and food sweet fried shrimp and steak salad The only problem was that a few of the other things we were interested in on the menu weren t available I think they would do well to expand the brunch choices and maybe include a cocktail with a brunch entree for a set price While we were there two parties came in and promptly left because they wanted more choice and unlimited drinks It s a shame because the decor is lovely and spacious 
a64LYYr9bgQlkSuAK3w8HA CMU Food was good but a bit expensive Rate it 3 5 farm scramble very simple eggs 2 slices cheese arugula and bread Paid 10 12 could have been a bit cheaper for the small portions and simple preparations 3 5 blueberry pancakes good 4 omelet regular 3 5 Would not go again since it was too expensive and the portions were small but the food was good nothing wrong with it but nothing to rave about Breakfast Came back again and got the country breakfast with eggs sunny side up They were good as was carrot hash and whole wheat biscuit Was surprisingly filling but I suppose it was all the carbs Friend had porridge with almonds and that was sweet and tasty though still a bit expensive 12 6 So I said I wouldn t come back again but this is my 3rd time back in 2 weeks I guess there is just no other comparable place next to Columbia Still pricey but food isn t oily and tastes good Had the soup special puree of vegetable root Was good about 3 5 not fantastic but good enough Ordered grilled cheese sandwich that was just ok 3 Came with small cup of coleslaw really bad 2 12 8 Came here again for brunch I can t help but come back I really don t want to since its so expensive but oh well Had the brioche french toast 4 The carmelized bananas were good wish there was more The portions were huge I ate less than 1 3 of it But I m not really a french toast fan but there was nothing wrong with it My friend had the burger which I didn t taste but it didn t look like it had much on it except cheese I really like my burgers with lettuce tomatoes and onions 1 7 Came again at friend s request Had the brown rice bowl with tofu Once again the food is healthy and fresh though over priced Probably won t come again unless other people want to come Friend got BELT looked yummy and greasy but that s how they are 
a6gOFCs5Bc18MmNyz3wKFA CMU This is a great little cafe which turns into a bar at night Perfect for Sunday afternoons when you want food or coffee that someone else prepared and you want to be around other people who are quietly engaging in homework or reading Then you get a second wind and want your friends to come watch the football and have a beer with you Best of both worlds I just wish they stayed open later and that their menu was a little more adventurous 
A6jjcrQwStzouhedx8gG0Q CMU Cozy atmosphere and yes good coffeeshop music Norah Jones Tegan and Sara etc I went a little past noon on a Saturday and it was pretty full but not packed The lighting is dim towards the inside but the street side half of the cafe gets enough sunlight for reading My only frustration was the fact that the free wifi is only free Mon Fri Otherwise the Brie Tomato panini and Black Forest Ham panini we had just under 8 were pretty good I could see myself working here for hours without a problem 
A73e42hCyMomG4YBe7l8Pw CMU brunch was okay 
a8-jS1a8-EnQI7-j9oO1EA CMU Great chill place around Columbia Recommendation There s a lounge in the back go down the stairs and you ll see couches tvs and a bar Tuesday afternoon evening 5 Sangrias and 5 tapas special Tapa 5 honeydew and prosciutto i thought this was an odd combination but it tasted pretty good very light with a hint of sweetnesss Sweet potatoe w apples soup 5 I think it was the special soup for the day but also very good creamy but I could definitely taste crisp apple in it Friend ordered the artichoke dip 11 and it looked very amazing I will probably get this next time Overall a solid place to hang and eat 
abbxN0ayRw5pV-LJfgifMQ CMU When we arrived here at 9 30 on a Saturday night the place was totally dead This probably should have been a warning sign However we had made the journey from the UES to join a friends of a friend for dinner so there was no turning back The tapas menu was priced a bit high so I opted for french onion soup and an ahi tuna salad Both were extremely bland I hate going out to eat and thinking that I could make something better at home The only thing keeping them away from one star is their awesome sangria We had a pitcher of the white peach and raspberry both were delicious This place might work well for the Columbia crowd who doesn t venture too far away from campus But it simply didn t work for me 
ABNXLh0BdwLn3VSDrcld8A CMU Enjoyed a lovely Sunday brunch with my girls The weather was nice so we dined outside I made it simple with just a burger and fries and it was delicious The waitstaff was very friendly and they sat us pretty quickly The location is perfect for some fun outdoor dining 
AEV8OYr3BFJkW5bDeE3iJA CMU Been here 2x now OVERPRICED small portions of mediocre food For example a 15 smoked trout salad includes only 3 pieces of endive as the main leafy component and the flavors didn t make up for the size Grass fed burger ok Dry omelettes 
AhlMFMfIxTaOfdCCGogTYg CMU This is definitely a 3 5 stars kind of place but I guess I m just not feeling super generous so we are opting for 3 It s a very cute quaint little place on the UWS where you just go up and order your food and then pick it up and bring it to your table I got a turkey avocado wrap which was good but not seasoned at all I had to put my balsamic dressing from my salad on it And I thought it was kinda on the expensive side a turkey avocado wrap and a Diet Coke a can of coke not even a cup with ice on the side was like 11 bucks Maybe I m just being nit picky It was definitely good and satiating I guess I just wanted a bit more 
AILHFH5EdwYIsKaGbe2tDg CMU I went here on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was fairly empty Service was friendly food was better than I expected I had the Shrimp and Grits which had a lot of flavor a nice smokiness to the properly cooked shrimp and the grits were creamy The dish definitely lacked salt which seemed to be a common problem Several of us needed a healthy sprinkling and once that happened my dish started to pop It s pretty amazing how bland a dish can be without salt I live in Soho so it was quite a haul to get there and I don t feel compelled to go back or necessarily recommend it to anyone at this point unless they happen to already be in the neighborhood especially because it was just as pricey as anything I d get in my own neighborhood despite the humble ingredients in my dish 
AinGv7IlFXui48Kz2mxbHQ CMU The main reason I come here is because there isn t much decent food around Columbia I also like that they use organic ingredients though I have to admit I often wonder whether they actually do or not The food is solid but slightly overpriced for what it is the menu doesn t really change As many reviewers have pointed out the worst thing about this restaurant is the service I never know who is hosting running the restaurant when I walk in The waiters have attitude and are usually inattentive they re often clustered toward the bar chit chatting while the busboys are running around Service is slow It s gotten to the point where I don t really feel like going anymore because I don t want to deal with the lackadaisical service and the attitude 
AIYF_3fH44NVCCSgrwvPkA CMU Rotating menu Reverse happy hour Nice little spot in an otherwise empty area Late night happy hour and great food and service 
AJ2Q1JW4X9Y1eNWXs2yQ4w CMU Thank you Lura our neighborhood desperately needed you What a pleasant surprise I came to Lura for the first time the other night and was blown out of the water by the ambiance and attention to detail The restaurant bar has great curbside appeal with an intimate clustering of tables street level with an amazing gazebo like wood bar in the backdrop The bulk of the seating is hidden downstairs where there is another exquisite bar From the woodworking to the exposed stone and brick to the fireplace feature it is quite apparent blood sweat and tears went in to renovating the space formerly Voza I sipped a wonderful glass of Sancerre and nibbled on some complimentary blue cheese stuffed olives The staff was friendly and attentive I am more than thrilled that there is a relaxing and luxurious space to enjoy a late night glass of wine in the neighborhood as the current choices either close early or fail to provide any ambiance Please go and support our new local business 
aK-pMcFtU3SLuNf7q88gcA CMU Community is a good solid spot for a notch above average food sometimes way above average For example their kale salad was quite hearty and healthy and price was pretty good for a salad I also recommend their dirty martini The people who work here are super sweet and quick At the same time I never feel rushed 
aK7ts-oO99wpsu_34sKCaQ CMU I m not impressed with this place Yes it s trendy Yes it s very popular Yes I like the decor But It s heavily overpriced Ingredients are fresh but bland I got the sausage and eggs platter and expected more flavor from the chicken sausage and carrot hash brown I had to sprinkle both with lots of salt I felt the same way when I came here for dinner once and got the brown rice and veggie bowl For the price I d rather go to Deluxe across the street and order additional dessert I expected more from this place with all the rave reviews Sigh seems to be yet another establishment for yuppies 
AkL56lz5fBTx30zS-gplQw CMU The next time I have to put a code into the door of the bathroom I m going to have a freak out Unfortunately the only decent place down the hill 
ALPfH7TKnpPyZGSSXop3XQ CMU I came here to meet a few friends for drinks The place is small but there is a good atmosphere and they have free tapas during happy hour The tapas were ok and the happy hours drink were 7 which I guess is okay I actually showed up a few minutes after happy hour but because we had such a large group the waiter let us have a couple more rounds at happy hour prices Unfortunately as soon as you stop drinking they kick you out 
aLq0mSQ9Gy1f7zJaT4XzVw CMU Great Meal Our party of two was seated by an affable and polite hostess setting the mood for a lovely evening Our interactions with the staff consisted of pleasant and informative conversation The food is fresh and complex a marriage of seasonal offerings and attention to detail It seems mildly adventurous but almost too safe It seems the talented kitchen is hesitant to take risks they have the potential to surmount While all three dishes spent maybe a moment too long in the fryer the sauces fruits and accoutrements forgave a new opening its jitters The staff s attentiveness made the evening overall pleasant and we look forward to giving it a second try 
AO5ozVDB6_2nSdaLE5nFbg CMU The food tasted good until i found a hair embedded in my burger First I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and be quiet about it I picked it out and continued eating Then I realized that wasn t the only one there were at least ten more They were literally embedded in my burger and fries Because they weren t merely on top of the food and because there were so many I knew this couldn t have been an accident DO NOT EAT HERE 
AOn6rrVon2fCO4gqDvdd4g CMU I don t understand the mediocre reviews It s a good burger spot in a neighborhood that needs new little joints like this I get the burger fries each time I m there and it s good The meat is tender and juicy and the fries crispy Portions are large and the service is very kind and attentive The design is new and modern and they have seats outside which always is a plus during sunny days 
AoOLHoVdYNtSrWsvWSh54w CMU food was delicious we got the Macaroni and Cheese to share and it was quite tasty as an entree I got the butternut squash risotto I had never had risotto so I was looking forward to trying it it was really good I really enjoyed it my fiance got the Spinach Pasta Pork Sausage Ragout and he LOVED it It was a little pricey but we had a gift certificate that made it not so bad overall I would recommend this place 
aOQognA8NTI7F_857jkLLA CMU I have only been here for brunch but I love the bistro eggs On a sunny day this is a great place to go if you live in the area 
apkKQtxfqvPkBZUiqBA7Ew CMU Fantastic burgers even better french fries brunch all day good trusty spot They also have a cool selection of beer Their house balsamic dressing is really yummy I wouldn t try the buffalo chicken salad weird combo of buffalo wings but in a salad Overall great place to get good food and relax 
apMnMsowRBCdFHcm3aT27g CMU File under looks very good tastes not so good The room is lovely with its high ceilings clean lines and a warm bright feel It is a welcome newcomer to the Columbia community as a coffee hangout The coffee is strong and hot and served in large cups The breakfast menu is so so The blueberry pancakes are adequate can be shared by two and are served hot and fresh The french toast is for those who crave a very sweet meal and it looks rather unappealing with the large banana on it The fruit salad is mostly banana also a very expensive banana course The ommelette looks great but was heavy and congealed DON T TRY Sides are a bit expensive The BELT bacon egg lettuce tomato on sour dough bread was a bizarre mix for me The sourness of the bread made the egg taste rotten sour I don t like sour eggs not in a BELT not in a melt The lunch menu has most of the breakfast items plus some sandwiches in the 10 to 13 range etc So far mediocre but they look good The fries were soggy Best bet go off hour and enjoy some great coffee and a nice room Service varies some servers have an attitude and others have been excellent Beware the busboy with earrings who puts his dirty hands in the food when he brings the plates out to the tables As I said stick with the coffee 
aQxygvRa5P39eA3UTNUTeA CMU The food was just ok the service was non existent They only time we saw our waitress was when she took our order which came out wrong and to give us the bill She didn t come by to see if everything was ok it wasn t and if we needed anything more water and to fix my order my boyfriend had to track her down to let her know my order was wrong and even then she didn t even come by the table to say anything The next time we saw her was when she handed us the bill Not sure if I would go back 
aQ_KZktlqcj1IMBNmYR81g CMU I go back and forth about how I feel about this place I miss Sip The dam is no Sip But it is a bar with music that seems to be streaming all my favorite high school tunes It has fun games and a great bar to hang out It s confused about how to use space though and is not quite efficient in fitting tables and chairs inside in my opinion The people who work here seem a bit vanilla and the menu prices are high Don t get the tomato soup It is clearly out of a can So mostly bummed out Unless I want to hear some RHCP Fuel Counting Crows and the like 
Ar4nzCUy8zXnZXW-QzUPeg CMU 3 5 Came here for brunch recently and it was actually nice to see something like this in the neighborhood I ve been in Harlem for a year and I just haven t had any hope for the food selection here so I never ventured out much for food The skirt steak and eggs had a lot of flavor They seem to have a good selection of beers so maybe coming for a drink would also be fun It s one of the better spots I ve been to in this area FINALLY I find something other than fried chicken or pizza 
arpv4P-lhI0MiEo1ixvPdA CMU Once we had a party of 6 and the bar was NEAR EMPTY However they wouldn t let us sit because they did not want to push the tables together to accommodate the group size so they asked us to wait for the designated seats for large groups despite all the available space WORST service I have ever experienced 
aSaaLRbL1ehx8QrVkZn1uQ CMU Neat place I didn t really have a good experience though We were sat by ourselves and then forgotten about Although I was impressed by the organic good and farm raised meat eggs I wasn t entirely impressed with the menu but a lot of people seemed to find just what they were looking for I would give it another shot sometime While I was there a woman next to us ordered blueberry pancakes and they looked amazing 
asyei2N1AJUvgN0j1N91bw CMU The service was great My server was very attentive and personable The atmosphere was dope I had the lamb burger and sweet potato fries The lamb burger was good but needed just a bit more flavor It was still really good though The sweet potato fries All I can say is that they will make you an addict They are LEGIT 
AV1xeJH2hPUH0wdn32KvNg CMU the veggie burger was so freakin tasty that i thought about ordering one to go and to our waitperson who was from the czech republic describe the veggie burger as tasty lusciousness 
av1zNFvnp4jldthOqicCyA CMU Overpriced and overrated Some of the breakfasts are alright but the rest is generic American food with an organic pretense which explains the ridiculous prices The food itself is alright but certainly not worth more than an irregular visit 
Avgk_XggqAYktoqAvPqkeg CMU We stopped in for brunch today and were pleasantly surprised My friend who s not eating gluten had a modified Eggs Benedict which they did happily perfect poached eggs My grilled sausage and eggs were tasty and plentiful The coffee was really good and refilled often The beer selection looked good with about ten taps and indications that beers rotate often Really nice wait staff and great music round out this terrific local cafe 
avkQEywxXpy4DOxLU_Mbig CMU Great brunch Our party of 4 had to wait around 20 minutes at 1 30pm on a Sunday There are lots of appealing menu options but I settled on the veggie sandwich with bacon on multigrain essentially a BLT with avocado muenster and sprouts with dressed greens on the side it was a perfect sandwich Everyone I was with enjoyed his or her dish someone s biscuit sandwich looked good as did the daily special of huevos rancheros Service was prompt and seamless 
a_HwDyM9GN1gFrEkCUWG7w CMU Amrita is currently petitioning to get an outdoor patio for the cafe which would be wonderful The only thing better then their paninis are paninis that I can eat outside However during the week they have wireless so there are tons of people who decide to camp out with their Mac take up a whole table and work on excel spreadsheets for 3 4 hours which is really annoying During the week if you walk in after 5pm you ll have to elbow a local teacher group out of the way to get a table But I am happy that this place seems to be thriving and is always busy I think its a unique place with its atmosphere menu diverse crowd good music and liquor The paninis are really good even though they re a bit pricey 9 they come with a side salad and I always go for the Club and a 5 house wine 
B-PjlLhdD5thPf1LPFXctg CMU Service food quality was great price well par for New York Beer selection was excellent too Don t get why the negative reviews Maybe have to try it another day 
B5f4wvX9knwygdZJRYqv-g CMU Hm They have 1 2 off monday meals w order of drink And other assorted great deals Small place decor is kind of leopard print legging momma lots of padded red and black leather stainless steel bar chairs candle light and small glass colored tiles food is reasonably priced without deals too and vary around a theme of spanish tapas small sandwiches and panini bar food and odds and ends Logically it has all the bits and pieces that could make a good occasional dinner but I think I prefer it as a late night snack location with a small group of friends It s also likely a good candidate for a place for a couple that has been together a while and doesn t need to indulge in viewing gallery pompous shows of affection i m thinking something like indecent acts performed on nightclub speaker stacks It s great if you just want to have a lively conversation and drinks The place won t impress and I think it s probably best for a couple that is already impressed with each other Good thing I m writing this on Valentine s day 
b7MC1WDIW1RCtRpHCtIOOw CMU There was a lot of anticipation and hype for the opening of this restaurant I can say its a slight gem in this crazy neighborhood Tried their mojito overly sweet no flavor action except sugar 
bb7wihia7IhAT3U51NDpVQ CMU Sunday brunch nothing special or noteworthy Limited menu choices which unfortunately didn t limit Chocolat s uber steep prices Better choices abound nearby and I m sorry adding an 18 gratuity to one s bill just doesn t feel right 
BcBYLdJ3GLXbZ_GtI16kFA CMU My friend and I had a fun happy hour in their outdoor seating area The Almond Joy martini is a must liquid coconut and chocolate and their coconut mojito was refreshing We ended up ordering two mojitos though and they were noticeably different in sweetness Nonetheless a great happy hour deal near Columbia for sure 
bDfO8bg_NPjri37VpFkXPw CMU The food was very filling and delicious I ordered a spinach omelet The prices were great and the servers were attentive and polite which is always a plus 
beLE7j1roQaEaacKIzW2-w CMU I love this place Probably because I live right around the block and it s the most convenient spot for a quick brunch and one of the only decent places to eat in a few blocks radius from my apartment I usually come here for brunch the quiche Lorraine on the brunch menu is superb as are the Blood Mary s but a few months ago I went there for dinner and drinks They have a great selection of beer and hard apple cider I m a big fan of their pulled pork sandwich and their wraps Excellent service relaxed atmosphere The location at 103rd street is much nicer and has a larger menu outdoor seating but the Harlem joint is just as good in my opinion 
BeXRGBBYc4pM5IQHyw5S-A CMU Awful service They always charge something extra that we hadn t ordered The price is not even that great for the quality you re getting It s only good for a few drinks The bartenders are usually nicer than the waiters 
Bf7HMgb9VRTRLmZeSOMZHA CMU Hubby and I had a date night here before they got the liquor license Staff was exceptionally friendly which was unexpected given the moderately pretentious outward appearance A GF and I went back for drinks after dinner on a weeknight after the liquor license was obtained of course The bartender was very friendly made great recommendations and the cocktails were fantastic Prices could be adjusted downward a little but don t seem too out of line with the rest of good dining in Harlem I find the down home places in Harlem to be the ones that tend to be overpriced I digress Nice vibe good food great drinks worth a look 
BfpofagzrVChgEtNcQwKFA CMU 1 200 review Massive props to Sip and Ciris the owner with big shout outs to the awesome DJ booth built over the stairs the Lincoln pennies meticulously placed the infused orange and vanilla bean vodka the scrumptious mushroom side the delectable Brussels sprout salad and the awesome soul funk vibe It feels good to have a real neighborhood joint 
bg-BwqIZqfDEj5e3n4dDmw CMU I strongly believe that 5 Diamond have some really good food I liked the owner and service was great But this review is for their tasting menu On a normal occasion it is 50 per person but Gilt City had a promotion 63 for a tasting menu for two The starting appetizer was Heirloom Tomato Salad with Herb Burrata Creme Baby Mache White Balsamic Gelee The Gelee looks like a transparent jelly was delicious with the mini tomatoes Then there was the Chorizo Crusted Halibut with Asparagus Sunchoke Puree Sweet Pimenton Oil The fish was slightly more cooked than to my liking but still flavorful Third dish was Senat Farms Chicken with Vermont Goat Cheese Potato Puree Brussel Sprouts Natural Jus This was not too bad but quite the ordinary And finally we had a chocolate cake for dessert This was very so so Dessert is definitely not a strength for this restaurant So maybe the tasting menu isn t the greatest Portions were definitely half of actual entree sizes Therefore the tasting menu isn t necessarily value for money since I could pick and choose my own food and share it with my food partner Nonetheless there are several indicators that suggest that their food is really good For one next table neighbor couldn t help complimenting and oozing Ah so delicious Wow cooked to perfection Best I ve had in a long time for their Slow Braised Lamb Shank 26 And second many friends from school school is pretty close by have raved about their amazing 5 at 5 special where beers wine appetizers are all five dollars between 5 30 7pm Tues Friday I have been told portions are great and food is excellent Service was great attentive wait stuff and a pretty romantic ambiance I recommend you try it out yourself and let me know if the food not tasting menu is as good as what my next table neighbor proclaims Go on now Check out my tasting menu food photos 
BgbQ53JAyH_hz0k42iQrsA CMU I love Harlem I repeat I love Harlem I love all new and different businesses that are opening up in Harlem to add new flavor to the still up and coming neighborhood that is Harlem Sadly as much as I d love to give this place 4 star or 5 stars I simply cannot The beer selection here is superb I highly recommend the specialty beer called A Little Sumpin Sumpin It s strong stuff and quite tasty I also had the cheeseburger sliders and the BBQ wings Solid However this place is lacking precisely where Harlem is usually lacking SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE In a place that s been touted as much as this one has with such a strong presence in an ever increasingly popular neighborhood you just cannot have people working for you with that typical BS I ll do it when I do Harlem service attitude This is not the way the neighborhood is going The expectation for prompt service only increases as the neighborhood becomes more gentrified and wealthier Harlem Tavern you must keep up with the changes in the neighborhood Fail to do so at your own peril Hire people that take service seriously please We all want to see you do well and grow with the neighborhood but people will tire very quickly of you if your serves maintain that typical BS bad service in Harlem attitude Clean it up 
bgwU6eCqyYB6VnThgM23xQ CMU The short description of this resto is that you will need to bring some bling because it is on the high end of pricey but hey it was probably built to cater more to the Columbia U Community I ve read other reviews and must agree that the wait staff as pretty as they are do not pay much attention to detail i e yes I asked for toast with butter AND jelly and yes I would not mind my check after waiting 10 minutes Nothing to boast about though 
bh9hRYmASeEGs2FWZQ949g CMU Just because I went on the opening day doesn t mean I can t review it I ve been to plenty of restaurant openings and had a great experience This is your shot to give me a good impression and you blow it My first issue is that they should of done a soft opening They were being really greedy about trying to get the 4th of July crowd in there and didn t make sure the experience was good enough The wait staff was clueless I saw a guy walking around for 15 mins trying to figure out who ordered the burger and fries he had Upon arrival we were told we couldn t get food why because they had too many people HELLO why weren t you prepared for that It took 25mins for my waitress to tell me they did not have frozen magaritas and then an HOUR when she came back and said that they did not have mint from my mojito They didn t seat us at a table you literally walk in and good luck find a table yourself I gave this place a second shot and the second time not one waiter ever came over to take our order Went to the bar got a drink and i was given a watered down mojito My friend went another day and they ran out of BEER seriously Moral of the story is yes this place is a nice spot for Harlem something different and SURE it could be great but my suggestion is that you wait at least a month until they fix the kinks because they clearly have many 
BivcFdLz4WSF6KdV9GqzkA CMU Great option in the neighborhood for a more elevated yet casual meal Mussels are well prepared with a flavorful broth and the portion is generous more than enough to share as appetizer and even enough to be a potential entree for someone However they only give 2 meager pieces of delicious crusty grilled bread which is critical for enjoying mussels so you ll have to request more Lobster mac and cheese is a little dry light on the cheese and cream for my taste but some people prefer a healthier version I suppose The noodles are prepared with a generous amount of black and or white pepper so it s also very peppery which I like Finally they have a fantastic beer selection 
-6oZZn9vCvs_zeI5LK06wQ CMU An out of town buddy who I haven t seen in a while came to visit Of course I had to take her to my fave eating spot in Princeton Even though we were quite late they were pleasant welcomed us greeted us by name very nice touch although I m sure the maitre d just figured it out from my apologizing for our half hour tardiness and the name on the reservation and seated us immediately in the main dining room Service as always was impeccable throughout The perfect combination of low key so that we could enjoy ourselves and attentive They have three tasting menus with optional wine pairings but you can also order any dish a la carte and they will readily tailor your whole meal without a fuss to your dietary preferences vegan gluten free whatever and suggest better tastier alternatives for certain restrictions as you order Food is fresh and locally grown which makes the dishes delightful My friend and I both opted for a la carte choices rather than sitting through a full tasting menu After the amuse bouche we both started with the field greens salad for our appetizers This salad is not for everyone but since I have an adventurous palate and love things fresh and natural I personally love it As the waitress was putting my plate down I had a moment of panic that it would be drowning in dressing as I had forgotten to ask for the dressing on the side Not to fear it was perfect The naturally peppery sharp flavour of the greens came through enhanced by sweet but slightly tart lychee tomatoes I promptly scarfed the whole thing down It usually comes with chunks of cheese which my friend enjoyed I don t do dairy If you re expecting a traditional salad that s made from the stuff you get at your local supermarket and is then doused in dressing then I would pick something else For our entrees we had the lamb and baby eggplant The lamb came on a bed of beets and oyster mushrooms an unexpected but just delicious savory combination I was going to order the ratatouille but the server suggested the baby eggplant instead I was a little concerned about the ciabatta in the entr e since I m not a huge bread person but there was very little bread Fantastic choice I thought I was going to have an orgasm as I ate the tetrogonia or New Zealand spinach in the entr e which was cooked to perfection I ve never had such tasty vegetables in a dish Perfect mix of textures and flavors Another great choice on the menu is the short ribs We skipped dessert but they brought small brownies and other sweet nibbles with our check and gave us small pre packaged cakes on the way out the door All delicious On other visits I ve sat at the chef s table my first visit upstairs loft private party and of course in the main dining room Personally I prefer the main seating area My only complaint every time I dine here I get sparkling water without ice As it starts to run low the water guy invariably appears out of nowhere to refill my glass with iced tap water My glass is replaced as soon as I point it out but maybe they could develop a system to prevent this minor annoyance As to valet parking I love it Since I am invariably fashionably late the sooner I can abandon my car and sprint into my destination when I m meeting someone the better At any rate this is by far my favourite restaurant in New Jersey I keep coming back because the dishes are always creative use unexpected combinations are modified frequently based on locally available produce and taste sublime Great place for dates or special occasions too 
-6sHFac49degGxjO1QljFQ CMU I came here with four other people and really enjoyed myself They had a great vibe going on you totally don t expect a huge place at the end of that long hallway The atmosphere is really cool especially if you sit upstairs They have a way back room with better lighting and heating lamps and I was glad we sat there Anyway we had the white bean dip and grilled brie everyone loved these They didn t give us enough pieces of bread so we asked for more and the server was nice enough to do so We all also got drinks IPA Pilsner and Honey I agree they felt watery but some were stronger than others Either way I don t agree that the price was a lot so it didn t hurt to try I did think some of their other drinks choices mixed or wine were pricey so I didn t even touch that Anyway mixed comment time I was overjoyed that they had a good vegetarian option a Seitan Chicken Club I was pretty interested to try this My friend also got it because he wanted to try seitan Well the damn thing didn t even have seitan on it It was like a cold fake soy chicken salad with tempeh as bacon and avocado on the bottom It was good especially on the bun but there was no seitan to be found So they lose a point for having no idea what the hell they are advertising Anyway my friends got burgers thought they were ok They have this ballin mayo aoili dipping sauce and fries I liked those the best Just try it out with some friends and have fun doing so 
-9IrpelIpfvmTe7O_BJxzQ CMU When you walk into Elements you feel like your entering a very clean zen peaceful environment The decor and ambiance is a lovely change from most of the restaurants in the area We waited for our table at a very small bar with a very nice bartender Despite being crowded you still could talk comfortably and hear eachother at the table Two people in our party had the tasting menu which I would highly recommend Myself on the other had wanted the halibut only to be told they were out of it that evening It is a very different menu and unique presentations I could have done without the popcorn on my polenta appetizer My main course were the Colorado lamb chops which were tasty but a bit salty The dessert and complimentary cookies were lovely I also loved receiving a little sample of their pound cake when I left and enjoyed it the next morning with my tea I intend to go back and explore more of their menu 
-DWSJS6mqggttz6ZKac3hA CMU My fam bam and I tried this place out for Mother s Day My brother dislikes the city for some strange reason we aren t related okay we are but this reason is enough to say we aren t so he picked a place in the Princeton area The restaurant is pretty small inside but nicely decorated It s BYO so be sure to bring a nice bottle of wine with you The service was impeccable Our waiter was very very knowledgeable about the items on the menu The bread and garlic butter spread was really tasty but I m afraid was the highlight of the meal for me We ordered the fried calamari with soy glaze sweet peppers pesto drizzle for an app and it was really sweet too sweet The calamari was breaded and soaked in a clear sauce Not appetizing to me at all My dad ordered the New England clam chowder and it looked and tasted more like corn chowder Even the waiter agreed I ordered the roast baby rack of lamb and it was also really sweet Cooked perfectly though medium rare All the components on the dish were sweet rather than complimenting It came with sweet potato mash and a slice of pineapple hidden within I guess this can pass as sweet tangy My dad s mahi mahi which was a special for the night was also sweet but cooked well I couldn t help but peek over at the next table and saw they ordered the seared scallops for their app the table on our other side ordered the oysters for their app Dammit We ordered the wrong apps I did like the bathroom though I definitely appreciate stalls that run from the bottom of the floor to the ceiling so you get privacy Did I take a picture Maybe don t judge me If I m in the area again I would come back and try different apps and a different entree With more wine My dad took my wine away after one full glass cuz I was driving back home I didn t argue he has a good 30 years on me 
-GYjoBazy0jggvCwR6Z1tg CMU The chipotle mayonnaise is outstanding and the beer is QUITE good Honestly some people would find a way to complain even if they had undergone a total complainectomy and six weeks recovery 
-Kjr8TxR6WWE2_npknJdWg CMU The Triumph Brewing Company is an acceptable bar It has good beers they brew themselves and good food all a little expensive Unfortunately it may be the best Princeton has to offer which is a tragedy This place would be great as an alternative to many other good bars but as the best Princeton has it s just not good enough The first thing is that it s crowded I went on a Tuesday night and couldn t find a seat and had to wait half an hour for a table Most good college bars are crowded but the layout of this place doesn t make the crowd feel like a communal experience Its bar area is long and narrow which makes it difficult to mingle The restaurant is broken up into levels so that you feel alone Feeling alone in a large crowd is not easy but Triumph makes it happen There s a good selection of liquor and wine I m a beer man so I went straight for the beer The wheat beer was recommended by people on this site I tried it and found it good The Irish Stout was okay but I m not a stout guy The Irish Red was a little too heavy for me I like Killian s Irish Red but this was darker and heavier The beers were a little expensive more than 6 per Frankly this is a lot for a beer and especially a lot for beers that are just good I would not go out of my way to drink any of these three beers again and if I went back to Triumph I would only order the honey wheat The food was good Much better than the beer I had the vegetarian chili and found it surprisingly hearty I also sampled the roast arctic char and the pumpkin ravioli All were good They were sophisticated dishes cooked well with high quality ingredients Let s be frank though They were the cheapest entrees on the menu and overpriced at that We ordered them because the real dishes were a lot more I don t look for expensive foods at a bar I look for greasy food that goes well with beer However if you want expensive food this place is not bad Overall I liked Triumph okay If I was in Princeton again I would go there Its environment is not good its beer is okay its food is good and everything is slightly overpriced 
-KoDDJMsrgGox98KHP5FLg CMU This place is super deceptive due to the small door and huge area inside with multiple floors The service is a bit slow due to layout and just things take long but oh well I got the pumpkin beer which i was very happy with since it was pretty late in the season Everyone else seemed to be enjoying their beers They had a great deal on the flights and had many options I m not normally a beer person but id come back for beer and probably only that The menu was divided up in appeitizers paninis salads sorta sad looking and real food dinners The appeitizers were calamari which was standard the tuna raw which came out in small pieces probably more for 2 3 people to share and the crab tater tots which were also not enough food For 9 people 3 appeitizers was sadly not remotely enough One of my coworkers got the last salad which was a mix of walnuts apples cranberries and she got grilled chicken on it The fries you can get as a side or with burger was very good esp with the sauce similar to the ones served at TGIF chipotle mayo flavored The Tbone steak was over cooked look a bit dry too and the lamb was often cooked over or very well The Triumph burger was good but not as good as the one at salt creek grill by a long shot I did like how you can put mushrooms cheese good choices and other things with it The sliders also were very small even compared to ruby tuesday free sliders There was a german first on menu under dinner food that was very large portions 5 different types of sausages and sides that looked awesome The prices were reasonable between 9 and 29 tbone steak The hanger steak at 18 was suppose to be pretty good and the salads and burgers were 10 13 dollars with sides 
-KXX9-oWf2o4uNXiSrlK6w CMU I went to Triumph last Thursday with some coworkers after work for dinner I had never been to this Triumph although I have frequented the New Hope location several times It was interesting seeing how each venue had their own unique style I really liked the vaulted ceilings and wide open space We were seated in a booth on the lower level I ordered the Bengal Gold IPA which was excellent Our group started with the Calamari which was quite tasty The batter was light and non greasy and the marinara sauce was better than your typical rendition For my entree I ordered the Fish and Chips I am a Fish and Chip lover and I was very happy with my order The fries were crispy and golden and the fish was flaky and moist Other members of my party had burgers and ribs Every meal looked great and there were no leftovers All in all it was a really fun evening and the food was very satisfying I would definitely recommend grabbing a drink or a meal at Triumph 
-LsgmAAJDKLdu_H9uqNN-A CMU We made a reservation for dinner on 8 31 and tried elements for the first time we had a gift certificate What a wonderful dining experience The food was fantastic and the chef accommodated and surprised us with an excellent dinner one of us is vegetarian The staff and service were impeccable We also enjoyed four amazing cocktails We particularly loved the Privateer It was extremely generous of the bartender magician to share the recipe ingredients and musings behind this cocktail on his blog We were so taken by this tantalizing drink that we had to find and procure all the fantastic ingredients to make these at our home bar These will tide us over till our next visit and we re very appreciative Can t wait to return for more culinary and cocktail experiences we re fans 
-VyQY7Y0oTcO-H_Y04z8aA CMU This restaurant is by far one of the best I ve been to in Princeton and I ve lived here all my life I was lucky enough to partake in one of the Chefs tasting meals at the chefs table where Chef Scott Anderson delighted my friends and I with the most incredible selection of presentations I ve ever had The servers were wonderful and friendly the meal was exquisite Chef Anderson came out personally with each course and the drink menu was just plain awesome If you have any sort of occasion I suggest Elements more on the expensive side but the best meal you ll ever have 
-xfTWSK9WNrScSRj9276rA CMU As a Restaurant this is a great place to meet friends have a drink stay away from the 17 glasses of wine and then go somewhere else for dinner Prices totally outweigh the quality in actuality the food was equivalent to the Longhorn Steak House just a fancier atmosphere With all the choices in this area don t waste your time here 
0-i0_adKUKM66PfNUC_KXg CMU We used to come here every now and then but not anymore The last time we were there a few months ago There was an unwelcome visitor came to our table A COCKROACH came to our table I understand this is probably not uncommon at most restaurants but seeing it LIVE is a different story I will not go back again 
02JtpTMu1QOVx-o3LM4D-A CMU This restaurant is bare and stark from the front but pleasant modern inside We dined in the wine cellar as we were a party of 9 The staff was pleasant and efficient The food was far too ambitious for the kitchen and seasoning was either missing or too heavy handed especially in the overly spicy clams with no other seasoning and the so called foie gras with sauces which overwhelmed the palate Snails in puff pastry tasted as if they had been dumped from the can some bland sauce circling the plate far away from the escargots Wines are quite nice 
0595osDe6UXSYDO_K3HqTw CMU Didn t actually get to eat there even though the menu was very tempting There were 2 customers ahead of me they were together and 1 customer behind me Even though there were 3 people behind the counter no one thought to ask me what I wanted while the 2 ahead of me tried to make up their mind I left as well as the customer behind me 
094PeGYgc71DjD0ygKCr7g CMU Great service The food came out with good timing and everything was fresh and delicious We wanted to try out some side dishes and made that our appetizer We had the adult mac cheese and brussel sprouts with andouille Both were great We tried the potato chips which were totally yum as well I had the house salad I know I am boring but it was great and it was huge My bf had the Blackened Tuna sandwich it was tastey but he was expecting something else Over all I would say the quality and service is there The menu isn t very big but the taste it there I would def go back again 
09xXxOYeRrz_r1VnUALscg CMU Hand and fist above most in the area which considering the amount of disposable income is pretty shocking The environment and decor were quite upscale and hip not a personal favorite but was done well for the style They have a great beer list for a restaurant It s not Eulogy or Monks but had a few good Belgian beers I was not expecting Staff was very attentive and pleasant not overly fawning or on the other side snooty which can be an issue for me as I do not dress to the nines to go out to eat Started with a Pork Belly appetizer that was incredibly moist and a flavorful blend of distractions around it I would go again just for this Had the Muscovy Duck entree which was three styles of duck breast confit sausage with a tiny cassoulet I ordered the breast rare and it came as such which is generally not the case It was tender and savory The confit was delicious and not over dry in the least The sausage was the weak point of the whole meal it was dry though tasty We had no time for dessert as some of the diners had to rush to an event but they brought out a nice plate of petit fours one of which was a fruit jelly my personal weakness Overall I definitely advise dining here if you are looking for a meal you previously would have to travel to Philadelphia to get On a side note we had arrived late and only had forty five minutes for dinner and asked our waitress if that was a problem and she did not in the least seem put out and made sure everything came out in a timely manner We in no way felt rushed or left behind Been back multiple times and just wow this is THE spot to eat in Central NJ There are also two grades of tasting menu one which is just selections off the menu and another which the chef cooks just for you I advise you take the time and have the latter 
0fgd8BUJR2F2Vsqkuogxkg CMU We love the atmosphere the great beer and good food here I love the Irish Red Ale with a burger or falafel My husband likes the lamb chops The fish in the fish and chips was a bit too battery for me The restaurant is easy to miss the first time you go but it s next to Panera which is impossible to miss 
0hx4aJh6J3cFfV3AM9Ey1w CMU This place is overpriced and the crowd is all 20 to 30 somethings desperately searching for a good time in the middle of suburbia but I can t help it I love this place This is another example of knowing what to order Skip the high priced fancy sounding stuff and go for the sandwiches burgers and appetizers They re all incredibly tasty and the chipotle mayo that comes with the fries is to die for I almost always get the burger when I m here because it s heavenly Before I was 21 I liked this place a lot less than I do now but having happily turned 21 a couple of years ago I can finally drink here and my rating has definitely gone up The beer is unique and delicious and I love the seasonal beers The variety itself makes coming here a treat My boyfriend won t go here anymore because apparently he saw a roach crawling on the wall while he was at dinner and the management did nothing but look annoyed at him for pointing it out but until I have a bad experience I ll keep my rating as is 
0IUEjnmTiJnCXPk21TNoAg CMU My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary It was an older crowd for a Thursday night Very nice atmosphere for a group of friends or date The food was just OK but generally satisfying The bread was stale and served with a bean dip That was odd Menu was limited Portions were large We ordered the bruschetta to start Bruschetta is pretty easy to make however I wasn t pleased with the way it was prepared no basil Really The corn chowder was really good I ordered my steak rare as I usually do but I guess it was my mistake because it came out raw and mostly inedible for human consumption I probably wouldn t come here again since it didn t really impress me for the price 
0oSgHaCHm9z_AZMCHvGBIw CMU The service and quality of the food is going down hill What s going on Also the happy feet behind me was unpleasant on a recent visit Mentioned it to the waiter and he shrugged and went away Switched sides with Jim and 5 minutes later there was another set of happy feet Will never sit at a booth there again first set 20 s 2nd set old professor type 
0p44cADDU9SkeUTCFYr0IA CMU First visit to One 53 and we thoroughly enjoyed it Glad I made made reservations for Valentine s day dinner as clearly it was a popular choice Appetizer Salmon Tartare and main courses Yellowfin Tuna Seared Rabbit Loin were excellent Did feel that the cheese plate for dessert was way over priced for what it contained Only other detractor was that our server was not particularly friendly Look forward to another visit 
0VKS3IRk1ZFVt2Kf4lSzJg CMU Loved the service Main course was tremendous Appetizer promised much but delivered unusual mix of crab meat carpaccio and arugula Fussy presentation for what seemed to be good quality food Thought drinks were overpriced given locale This is not Manhattan but they are charging Manhattan prices 
0w6SADnIcM7-KtJD4JLepA CMU Jeeesh tough crowd These guys butchered the Triumph Not me this place is a little bit of all right It s basically your every day brew pub experience Don t know what i mean OK if your primary goal is to sample all their beers and then some they have a sampler deal which consists of a dozen or so beers in a small portion For me i found them pretty run of the mill home brews nothing special but good One criticism i agree with is slacker staff Man these guys are sampling too much of their own product Food is also nothing extraordinary but not bad 
18H17pJeHeIKRHHsU8qg0w CMU Not sure why this is listed as not being good for kids We took our three little ones for lunch and were surprised delighted to find high chairs and a suitable kids menu The grown up grilled cheese with Brie figs and tomato was delicious We were in from out of town but would definitely go back some day 
18yRidrpNmhBiutvbCLtFA CMU Went to Elements for lunch to celebrate a birthday They had a fairly simple menu priced at 11 per course very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber From the first bite I could tell the food was prepared with fresher ingredients The roasted beets salad and the fluke were prepared beautifully and tasted even better My wife had the Peterson s burger which looked like a slider on steroids The service was very good the decor is lovely and the ambiance other than the cheesy muzak being piped throughout the restaurant was perfect for an intimate lunch Overall I would rate my experience at Elements between 4 5 and 5 stars so I ll give them the benefit of rounding up For a true foodie not a better lunch choice in the Princeton area 
1bLSJlViF_p8wjzf-s8g1g CMU Great atmosphere Cozy bar area Great garlic fries 
1Emgl7fWSkoT6O2J0Q1n7g CMU Just had dinner there tonight My friend and I were looking for a relatively affordable restaurant for dinner and settled on this since i had hear great things from another friend Great decision We were promptly seated though there was not enough parking in the lot so we had to park in another nearby store s parking lot though the good service ended there Service was extremely slow and our waiter had a bit of an attitude Thankfully the food was so delicious it more than made up for the bad service I ordered the chicken parmesan with fresh pasta from local fave Lucy s ravioli kitchen It was A mazing just what I needed for the night After dinner we also ordered the chocolate bread pudding It was pretty good I can t rave about it as some others on here have but it was satisfying enough I guess the downfall for me personally was that the chocolate was a little too bitter for my taste and the pudding was a little too dry and not moist enough But delicious nonetheless I will definitely be going back 
1h1NEqYav3eiOpKxlsW_Pg CMU Triumph is a lot of fun The beer is really good they have an IPA I m in love with and lots of other brews to fit every taste The food is good the beer is better Though they do have a hanger steak entree that I really do like a lot But definitely the best beer in Princeton 
1HR4wDIPGg_bv038FA7T7Q CMU We went to this place as this waitress standing outside was offering free croquettes to us and my hubby was in this mood to try a different cusine We saw the menu outside and it looked good and every item was around 10 15 But what we missed was that it was the lunch menu and for dinner the prices are much higher We went and saw that each dish was over 22 25 We weren t ready to shell out so much for some restaurant that didn t even look that fancy so we just ordered a salad and a dish called 4 cheese crepes SO we don t know what the waitress understood she brought 4 pieces of that item We were 4 of us We were in no mood to pay around 100 bucks So we explained to waitress what happened So the waitress goes and talks to the chef and a bunch of 3 or 4 people are looking at us and whispering some crap We were totally embarrassed Had they been a little understanding and gracious we would have taken the order But their behavior totally irked us off and we are never ever going to this place again They crepes tasted good though 
1jlQcwQAIXv3x2bKuwj_bw CMU I recently attended an event where we were served exceptionally good bread When I asked where it was from I was told the Main Street Bakery So though I had passed this place many times I finally made a point of stopping there Yum The bakery selection is amazing and everything I tried was delicious Cookies a raspberry almond bar mini chocolate bunt cakes salads There is also a nice selection of sandwiches soups and kids entrees with some items ready to go in the case Best of all the prices are very reasonable and service is friendly In nice weather there are a few tables outside This is a place I will be returning to for breakfasts lunches and baked goods 
1OuBl8RODxbxdKSZ0XvX9g CMU can go toe to toe with anyplace I ve dined at in NYC and for us a neighborhood place which really treats you like it never had a bad dish wine list and cocktails are excellent and extensive Jeff is a miracle for wine selections and hosts tastings too 
1QfK4bSwsJ1TAxBelMIoXg CMU I am an easy customer to please I overtip I don t ask for things made special for me I ve done the job so I empathize with those serving me That said my experience here was unfortunate Ordered the Epic Burger it wasn t epic Small with a poor choice of bun and accompanied by I kid you not about 20 fries We sat at the bar and I m sorry to say the bartender had no redeeming qualities You don t have to chat me up just be somewhat friendly pay attention to empty beer glasses in a reasonable amount of time The beer was decent 
1tr1-Msr0F7JdrvTaknoIw CMU So I met a few friends and had lunch here It s not a place I would typically eat 1 cause I m a vegetarian with the exception of fish every once in a while and 2 cause I m not a huge fan of BBQ taskting food aka steak house food but that is where they wanted to go so we did I had the fish special which was very good pricy yes but good I know this might sound weird but I love the decor of the bathrooms I know people don t go to a place based on what the bathroom looks like but I needed to say it The bathrooms are gorgous Dark wood and earthy tile LOVE IT Anyway so my friends love the food there and eveyone seems to like it so based on that and on what I had to eat I give it a 3 and 4 for ambiance and decor But keep in mind if you aren t a big meat eater like myself you don t really have much options except for like one or two things 
1Ys8c815E-opWSuYdXzQyg CMU I didn t know what to expect when I walked into ONE 53 for dinner I had read very little about the restaurant online and didn t do my normal drool ritual while looking at the menu Overall the dinner was a pleasant surprise The appetizers were fresh and prepared well letting the ingredients themselves shine on the dish The clams were fresh and the sauce they sat in complimented them well but wasn t overly complex The beet salad was fresh and simply prepared The entrees were similar in design simple and straight forward with no fancy sauces to mask the meats I chose the chicken milanese which was lightly breaded not too oily and a controlled enough cook to keep the moistness in the chicken A fresh tomato salsa esque sauce accompanied it The chef s preparation was smart letting the breadcrumbs and capers in the tomato salsa provide the right amount of salt The other diners I was with got the burger which was cooked with just as much care The standout component on the dish was the truffle mayo aioli Silly to love a sauce but this is worth sticking in your purse and bringing it home with you Overall ONE 53 is a great place that pays a lot of attention to its dishes the meats sauces and components on it Every addition on the plate is purposeful and meant to add a taste or texture to the plate which is how plates should be made 
1_pjvYL-0eDq9jN0d2uR4Q CMU Nice atmosphere quick and friendly service The food is a bit overpriced but it s nice for a happy hour 
23A0Kc7CQtPx_o2faENIoA CMU Went there for lunch for our anniversary It was WAY overpriced and worse yet I walked out hungry due to puny serving sizes I ordered the deckel for 26 the best part of a rib eye steak What came out were three tiny pieces of meat each the size of my thumb FOR 26 I complained to the waiter and the manager came over to offer something additional Nice gesture but what is this let s make a deal Besides I am a firm believer in restaurants especially high end ones putting their best foot forward So they wound up NOT bringing me any sides on the house nor even trying to make it up to us with a dessert on the house we ordered and paid for two desserts Besides the taste of the food was only ok Instead I suggest saving money having equally fine cuisine AND leaving on a full stomach by visiting Eno Terra in Princteon Kingston 
28DFLF0ufm1iZt6mGLo3VQ CMU Elements was recommended to me by a good friend He would be pleased and not so pleased with my experience I had lunch The appetizer was really lovely a Dandelion Gazpacho which came with a preserved lemon ice cream hazelnut bits cucumber shavings and rosemary flowers Spectacular It was bitter and smooth the flower flavor was so delicate and gave the dish a great green snap The hazelnut added a little crunch along with two very crunchy croutons With this I had a glass of the NV Zardetto Prosecco which went perfectly as it was dry Then came the main course pork belly with shrimp The small variety of shrimp were perfectly cooked The spicy sauce was very spicy and the little on the plate went a long way There was a cashew butter sauce as well which had a nice cooling effect However I didn t understand the pork belly at all Most people love the crisp melt in your mouth quality of pork belly This was not crisp It was not seasoned It was like a lump of fat on the plate hard hard to chew not heated not easy to cut with the knife provided Such a shame I would give this restuarnt another chance Sous Chef Mike Ryan is part of the Williams Sonoma Sou Chef Series and I just got his recipe for Mushroom Soup which I can t wait to try Also the waiter rushed me out the door I hate when that happens So two bad marks on an otherwise great visit 
2gzJBxOO9NzVcBMtyEZO-A CMU Pros Bartenders and Waitstaff are excellent Menu is dynamic and usually done well Managers seem to care which matters Obviously the alcohol is a draw but the food and open face chicken sandwich and calamari especially are brilliant Cons hard to get a seat they can get real snooty about bar area stools requiring full dinner orders Hostess quality is as bad as the bartender staff is good amazing to have such a disparity Price can vary rapidly across the menu Still a decent place if you have a reservation or can somehow catch it on a quiet night Decent people watching at worst part of a great princeton bar crawl at best 
2yokBJYiJLpTKNbP_L-qcA CMU This busy restaurant on Witherspoon St is definitely worth a visit if you re in Princeton They serve an eclectic mix of meals and all are wonderfully prepared The wait staff is attentive The decor is very pleasant for a great dining experience Please visit but forget to BYOB 
30j7TzThpDpmz6nv8Hn9CQ CMU The Ferry House used to be our favorite restaurants notice the term used to My wife and I had been a pleased customer of this restaurant for about 6 years dating back to 2004 We can always count on an excellent meal every time we visited We noticed the quality of the food and services had declined in recent years due to change in management but our most recent visit in July was the last straw The night started off fine with our waiter giving us the dinner specials but everything went down hill once the order was taken We spent half of our nights swatting flies that were buzzing around our table we did not see our waiter again until he came back to take our dessert orders not once did he come back and asked how our food was We had to request a different waiter to open our wines that were on the table on multiple occasions The icing on the cake was when I asked him to put a birthday candle my wife s birthday on the dessert another waiter brought out the dessert and just threw it in front of my wife and walked away I am not sure what our Waiter s mentality was maybe he thought this is a party more than 6 I am guaranteed 20 tip and I don t need to pay attention to their needs He can t use busy as an excuse because the restaurant was half empty Overall he was rude inconsiderate and certainly do not deserve the gratuity that was indicated on the check The food wasn t as good as it use to be and it tasted extra disappointing due to the horrible service we received I am not sure what changed throughout the years but this visit had certainly been our worst This was our favorite restaurant in Princeton and we often recommend friends and family to visit this restaurant when they are around town After our most recent visit I am afraid my above statement no longer holds true 
3A4nul7C3SOw4B5fxh6FqQ CMU I remember waiting for this restaurant to open and was very happy when I finally got to eat there Route 206 not a great road to drive on in general especially with the awful traffic 24 7 Elements is about a good 20 minute walk away from Nassau Street I think this restaurant would of done a little less successfully on Nassau Street personally because of all the competitors but that is just a personal opinion Anyway I thought the prices were not bad for a restaurant with such prestige Elements With affordable prices the food stands up to it s expectations 
3f-A8YBm0tuulZvIXURGTg CMU Very expensive for what you get The fries here are very good and crunchy The beers are about 5 and the mojitos are about 12 Unlike many of the other reviews our large party received excellent service 
3FbuIcl40iQuTfkK-fiKhw CMU Come for the beer they ve usually got quite the spread though they do run out on certain offerings a little more frequently than I like From ambers to lagers to stouts to IPAs this place has got it Personal favorites Pumpkin in the fall Rauchbier smoky flavor depending on how the brew turns out it can have a smoky campfire like taste or it can taste like bacon Weird I know but downright delicious For around 10 12 get the tasting sampler 7 5 oz beers Boom Food here is hit or miss Whenever they get creative with their menu I feel like it is an epic flop The standards however are generally good burgers sandwiches apps aka bar food In short come to drink and don t expect a 5 star dining experience Check out their location in New Hope too they have outdoor seating there right next to the railroad station 
3Fvc88NnewPooc0yYT3Tdw CMU I d give Triumph 3 5 stars I think the beer here is overrated for a micro brewery I ve definitely had better But that said the tripel is delicious although it s not on tap often and the wheat beer is good It s a bit pricey for bar food burgers fish and chips etc and they aren t outstanding for the price The atmosphere is fun but it s always loud and crowded I ve been here to both drink and eat For drinking there isn t much room to sit let alone set your beer down for long even on weeknights For eating it s not the place to go on a date if you want to hear each other talk If you re lucky you can get one of the booths or a table upstairs which are more isolated 
3RG4H8jKwfd4-x8LF-5JtA CMU beer is good get the honey wheat only thing is they use to have a really good bar menu but they changed it nothing is good i hope they realize this and bring back some of the old items At least they didn t get rid of the Triumph Burger which is pretty good 
3z2Xp91eqA-oTtk1xxRTQw CMU What a disappointment We decided to stop in and try some beer and perhaps grab a bite to eat We sat at the bar on the lower level and the barmaid could not have been less interested I ordered the Honey Blond and my BF ordered something different I don t remember what and he stepped out for a moment The beers were dropped in front of me and before I could even ask for a menu Caitlin high tailed it back to the boys at other end of the bar The only reason I know her name is because it s on the receipt I was kind of hungry at this point of the day and now pissed off at the lack of service so we paid for our beers and left The beer wasn t even that great I m no beer snob either But I know what honey tastes like and it wasn t in whatever beer I was poured 
3Z_0sdOCWOrM7iCkiEzSgw CMU I don t know much anything about beer but the reviewers here are being way too tough on the food I think it s great and I ve been to Triumph with a variety of different groups at least a dozen times over the years and am ALWAYS quite satisfied All the appetizers are super scrumptious I have enjoyed the fried calamari and the little pizza thing I forget what its called many times I ve had pretty good burgers and oh yes some truly excellent fancy style mac and cheese I don t think it was on the menu I was just hankerin and I asked and they made my dreams come true The service is ok the place looks cool with towering ceilings huge metal vats o brewin and an extremely long narrow shape it used to be a bowling alley Once I m 21 for a while I ll be able to assess the beer and barness of the place but from the looks of it it s not the best place for meeting nice normal peoples just come for some good moderately priced food and get the beer sampler that thing looks like fun 
43N24323AGlOp0_yDlxfug CMU 12 31 2011 Lousy service inhospitable staff and incompetent management I told the bartender I wanted to buy a drink for two friends before happy hour was over expecting to pay the happy hour price The bartender never said anything and charged me the full price for the drinks Upon my protest he corrected the problem but his attitude was the issue His attitude conveyed to me that I was a pain in in the a On another occasion I ordered a steak The steak was very good and should be for the price but I had to ask for salt and pepper Problem is I was half way through my steak before the sever got around to bringing the salt and pepper Any decently trained server would ask upon serving the food is there anything else you would would like Or would immediately recognize that they didn t bother to set a proper table or provide the most basic service Management doesn t bother to train the staff in the basics Beyond that the staff lacks any sense of friendliness and of being in the hospitality business Again it s a management issue At the end of my meal I asked for the check which I paid for in cash The server gives me what I thought was a receipt however when I looked closer it said balance due I called the server and the manager Elaina over to discuss the error I asked the server in the managers presence Did I pay the check To which he replied Yes So why does my receipt say Balance due Neither the manager or the server apologized for the error but again treated me like I was a pan in the a and they were annoyed that I should even bring their error to their attention Without immediate staff and management changes and improvements I think they ll be out of business in less than 6 months 
4hG4suZWHbD7_TAC5M3I3w CMU Dropped by this place intrigued by the Eastern European Food ad Most foods seem Bulgarian or Greek I had the Tsatsiki salad which was very yummy and served very nicely Then I had the Chicken and Spinach Crepe which was extremely good The atmosphere was very nice the service friendly and quick the food yummy I definitely recommend this place 
4HtFM3BEhWPssEmxaKAaQA CMU Good brews good steak 
4khDpWEuSIVBSi71tLTtEQ CMU My friends and I were a longtime fan of this place as students to come here and hang out over a beer they have a great selection of interesting ones on tap but this last trip left us feeling a little disappointed The classic delicious triumph burger seemed to have shrunk in size and the prices seem to have gone up as well While the food was OK service was excellent and the chipotle mayo was delicious as usual it wasn t as good as we remembered it compared to a few years ago Unfortunately we may have to find a new regular go to place back in Princeton and just come back here for nostalgia s sake 
4MD5zHLJbXT5dJ1UFKU7PA CMU Very very charming I ve been coming here for as long as I ve been making my commute and the cafe is always bright and the staff is always very helping especially during the holidays with the prepared food what Sometimes a turkey is difficult for a novice cook The black forest brownie cookie is to die for the extreme richness with the crispy outside and moist inside with cherries is perfection Cappuccinos are very good as well with the perfect amount of foam and coffee 
4mlJxLVk7er9D-2d0trEjA CMU The upscale cool space very good service pricey tabs and creative presentation are all camouflage to hide mediocre cooking and flavors Food Creative Big deal The flavors and the actual cooking was nothing to write home about Price Extremely expensive considering the quality Service Very good detailed explanations of what we were eating Atmosphere Upscale cool Full Bar I would NEVER go back 
4nt0EWXwUjGw5JQJW-dNww CMU So the rumors are true Just OK food Good ambiance VERY strange space Bad acoustics When the jazz band was playing on the other side of the restaurant it felt like the saxophone was being blown into my ear as I was eating my dinner Very very annoying I honestly can t remember what I ate here so that should tell you about the food The drinks were not so bad and I noticed they had some specials during the week and for happy hour The staff was helpful and attentive The entertainment was entertaining Even while I was screaming across the table so my guests could hear me over the music I suppose the music was still enjoyable It is a shame the acoustics are so terrible here as the restaurant is a beautiful place While we waited for our table we took our drinks from the bar to the outside lounge area where we relaxed with pillows next to the indoor outdoor fireplace Inside the decor was modern and upscale giving off a romantic feel I would say give this place a try since they are not consistent in customer reviews maybe your experience will be of the positive ones 
4Ot9L69yZsSTwcqTMk_AHg CMU I have stopped coming to Triumph on the weekends despite the fact that it has good specialty beer and a nice atmosphere The food is also decent especially the s mores I have almost no complaints about the actual food venue beer portion For this I would give 4 stars If you d like to check this place out I d recommend a weeknight The low rating is ONLY due to the terrible service and the pretentiousness of the staff The experience is for the most part unwelcoming and negative with some exceptions Let me share a few examples This is the ONLY place in town which charges a cover on the weekends supposedly for live music I would much rather pay twice that cover NOT to have to listen to the awful bands which sound like garage band mixed with karaoke In my opinion they ruin the atmosphere and make it hard to talk Staff is deliberately and frequently rude ignoring customers having an air of pretention being the only place in town to have ridiculous rules and to charge for things others do not charge for The impression I get is we are better than everyone because we are Triumph and we re going to treat our customers like cr ap because we can afford to I have been denied table service once when I assured them I was in fact having dinner but my friend was not and they didn t believe me I am the owner of a small non profit We have had events which regularly bring in 100 members to bars and restaurants around town which these businesses love to have 100 people paying for drinks but Triumph is the only place which has mandated a fee just for having a group of people come in not even to rent out the room for this reason we have refused to have an event there One time it was freezing cold in the winter I came to Triumph and was asked for a 5 cover but did not have any cash on me I asked if I could go inside in plain sight of the bouncers and get cash to give to the bouncer but was denied I was directed to an ATM inside their building which was broken When I alerted them of this they turned me away and told me to go 3 blocks down the street in the freezing cold to another ATM to get 5 so I could go into their restaurant I just went to Winberies and never came back Another time I told them I was going to see if my friends were inside and not staying and they confiscated my ID as collateral I think this is a bit unnecessary Thus it is pretty hit or miss It wouldn t be fair to say that none of my experineces have been positive and sometimes I still go to Triumph and enjoy myself if I m lucky and get a good waiter However they should really cut out the ridiculous rules pretention and train their staff better on customer service To sum I give it a 4 star rating for everything except service which gets a 1 
4scpt13QeTPFi_zZgHUI7Q CMU This is easily the best restaurant I ve been to in NJ I brought my girlfriend here for a significant birthday It wasn t cheap but well worth the price As other reviewers have said the food is delicious uniquely prepared and artfully presented and the wine list is very extensive 
4wBa_y4mLDkzdNxV_Oztjg CMU We were in town from LA and looking for a good spot with good beers hooray We found Triumph Food Good Beer Great Get the sampler of 7 beers YUM 
4yg-HxbhEl91bHr1QgXaRw CMU ha this place was found by my daughter and when we went there she tells me that they will cook a hamburger rare and she was right it is getting so hard to find a restaurant with enough guts as well as enough customer service savvy to do this on top of it the thing tasted great of course i did butcher it up with bacon and cheddar cheese and a hint of ground pepper the garlic fries are fantastic just the right amount of garlic to let you know that there is garlic in them fries the coffee and cream stout went down very well in fact the second time we went there two of them went down only reason for the lack of five stars the place is noisy the way it is built does not leave itself for absorbing sound 
4YxH5BgnGBzxt0DftNDQ_Q CMU More like a 3 5 star Pretty good I ve been here for drinks before and have always enjoyed what I got last night I went for food for the first time and enjoyed it as well Appetizer Fried Pickles my first time and I LOVED them Entree Crab salad it was tasty and fresh and light I enjoyed it My bf got the Triumph Burger and really liked it I had a couple bites and thought it was good and we both especially liked that when you asked for it medium rare it was actually made that way and not overcooked Service was good friendly and quick My only complaint for the night would be that it was a little loud for a date but it was a great atmosphere to go with a group of friends 
5DqojvrAIWz4oZhwMnjW5Q CMU Triumph is a great place to hang out after work school The beers that they brew are pretty good and worth every penny They usually have about 6 different types of beer and they have a rotation system in place If you have never been here before and manage to get a seat I d recommend getting the beer sampler I do not recommend eating This is where they nickel and dime you because most of the food is overpriced and you would feel like the money you spent on the food should have went to buying beer I had the Kobe beef sliders and felt like I could have had another meal Parking is a nuisance and you may end up parking a few blocks down the road on a crowded night The atmosphere is very lively In the bar area I have seen people from all ages order a beer Unfortunately the lower level is way to small for the amount of people who want to stroll in and have a good drink and you are almost always trying to scout for an open table Sometimes there will be a band usually someone indie and local perform I have never liked any of the performers but the only time I was upset was when my friends and I were sitting at a table next to the band 
5flI0ltV3JVpeM960lvv-g CMU Very good gourmet sandwiches soups salads and quiches Their desserts are very good too Quaint setting in an old house They have an upstairs for small groups too My only complaint is they are over priced especially the bakery items 
5FpuTjiCaclN6WYIN-YIaQ CMU Love coming to Triumph great beer great menu Never had a bad experience here It tends to get really crowded in the evenings so if you re with a bigger group expect a wait 
5GJD2CbYz2oImMpqN5EMRw CMU Ok let s get right to the point The food was excellent and the service was great for the most part Spend 100 00 pp and you will think it s money well spent And it would have been if we are talking only about food and service But having dinner out at a first class place is more It s also about having a conversation w friends in a restaurant that is warm and friendly My 4 stars would have been 5 stars had 2 things happened First the person who designed the interior should be shot Loud is not strong enough to describe the noise level on a Sat night The ceiling while not low did not have any noise abatement materials It looked nice but then again who looks at ceilings except me when I find it tough to hear someone sitting across the table from me Second to the adults who brought a 2yo 4yo and 12yo to dinner and then allowed them to run about the restaurant as if it was their game room at home shame on you If you can afford to eat here you can afford to hire a babysitter I was waiting for a wait staff person to fall over one of them but it didn t happen Which gets me to Ruth G s comment posted last month about the 5 drunk unruly women MANAGEMENT DOES HAVE THE DUTY TO CONTROL PATRONS It s my guess management doesn t want to piss off any patrons so they let things resolve w no action Well by doing nothing management probably pissed off a few patrons Sat night including me 
5H3uKe5d8WY9Zh0rc4qYgA CMU Went in for lunch The food was a bit expensive but tasted good We had a crepe and a gyro The mushroom crepe was drowned in a heavy cream sauce that ended up making my girlfriend sick The gyro pita was chewy It was good though and held up well when being eaten The side salad for the crepe was boring consisting of just shredded romain lettuce and balsamic vinegar Portions were small but it was enough to mostly fill me up My girlfriend actually left hungry 120 lbs We went and got dessert elsewhere to finish us off Not used to needing dessert after eating out for lunch 
5SLR6vRIGiMPkroSXU-yIw CMU I would give 0 stars if possible Doesn t accept coupons and the value menu is drastically overpriced I mean seriously 2 59 for a jr roast beef 1 89 for a value shake Furthermore service s rude and tediously slow If you re looking for an Arby s head to to PA or Edison 
5V9B3UqD-DL_ujmIMe0IxQ CMU Pure pureed my evening Bad show I made reservations 2 weeks in advance and was happy to take the trip from Philadelphia to Princeton to do a little sushi but mainly I was headed up to support a group of musicians who were scheduled to perform tonight I was upset to learn that the owner cancelled the gig the day of with no real explanation This decision has negatively effected at least 10 people so far and it s only 11 00 This is the exact kind of nouveau riche middle class bollux that will insure I NEVER support Pure in any way whatsoever full stop I find it rather dubious that an establishment can advertise no guilt as a mantra on their website and make Artistic assertions about themselves when they are unable to observe common courtesies of being professional or even human Their Philosophy page is coming soon according to their incomplete website Aside from being pretentious as hell it s not even done why bother creating space for an undone idea Perhaps Pure would give me the honour of creating it s maxim Bourgeoisie attitude with champagne prices or how about Pure Art is better when it s pretend Pure gets my lowest rating since my debacle on the main line A heartfelt F U from the original F Urqhart 
5xe9VMBfF6BgxDwj-RLZfQ CMU Excellent business lunch Had some of the signature sushi rolls and shrimp risotto Food vet good decor nice and service was great Would definitely go back 
6c3uSf_9LwqBBtSS-0Volw CMU Very good food great price 
6d_YqvUrQcqfoA9Drge1hw CMU Disclaimer I went here only for drinks and not food So I lived in Princeton for 3 months and I was pretty much disappointed with the lack of nightlife in the town I mean it is a college town but the few bars there on Nassau Street really aren t anything much I guess all the students here are studying their asses off or something I went there on a Monday Thursday and Friday night lol not the same week and the scene was pretty dead each night I also noticed that at night the old people come out tres scary The microbrews here at Triumph are meh I got a sampler of their 8 brews and honestly there was only 2 that I liked Still they have a full bar so you can get whatever you want Some people liked the design of the inside of the bar and others don t It s definitely unique to say the least There s nothing really special about the place and if you re in Princeton for whatever reason its probably the best place to go to to just grab a beer It s actually livelier during the day than it is at night sigh 
6i38pv0G-K36Y2YcJo3n4Q CMU We had an interesting experience here We ordered 2 medium rare filet mignons When they came out they were both over cooked closer to brown than red Mine was close to medium well and my friend s steak was close to well done She sent her steak back and they brought out a new one this time it was completely rare hardly cooked at all On the third try they brought out a half decent medium rare steak but the grade of meat was so poor it was not very appetizing even when it was cooked correctly Third time s a charm right not when it comes to dinner That was the highlight of our experience but the wait staff was very polite and apologetic All said and done they gave us the whole meal on the house a manner that you rarely see honored at most restaurants these days which was very kind but I wouldn t recommend the filets The atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable with a pleasent all american smell of smoked cuisine filling the room They struggled with cooking the filets correctly but I would be willing to revisit Salt Creek and try a different plate 
6IunvFwaLCkW1_wVtbBwXg CMU Their annual Oktoberfest menu was incredibly off the hook but unfortunately doesn t run year round The rest of their menu is also insanely delectable and worth the money though it does come with a price Well whiskey is more expensive here than anywhere else I ve ever been but I guess most people go to breweries for the beer Definitely a great place to meet up with friends and have a few drinks and apps but I would only go back for a full meal in the fall 
6JAABtKmhhLXUql-Zzp_kg CMU I don t know whether or not to call this restaurant a Princeton institution or not as I ve heard both yea and nay to the idea but from my experience I would say that it definitely deserves a shot at such a title I came with a party of four for dinner Saturday night and we were seated promptly at a table upstairs In addition to being a restaurant Triumph is also a working small brewery with plenty of house brews on tap Though I can t speak for the beers personally one of my friends who did have a drink said that the raspberry beer was fantastic he ended up ordering a growler of it to go after dinner For my meal I ordered the pork belly sandwich since it looked like something I couldn t get readily anywhere else This turned out to be a very good decision The sandwich came with a nice thick slice of crispy surprisingly meaty and lightly charred pork belly flavourful tomatoes jalapeno aioli and crisp and zesty picked vegetables on hearty toasted albeit slightly greasy bread This was probably one of the best sandwiches I ve had in a long time the pickled vegetables contrast perfectly against the fatty pork and buttery bread and there was just a very light bite from the jalapeno aioli The fries that came with the sandwich were battered lightly which is almost sacrilegious in my mind but were not bad overall My friend ordered the grilled cheese with brie and apricot preserves which she described as delicious and one of the best grilled cheeses so I ll leave that to you to verify It did look very good however Service was good the night I went Everything was handled efficiently without drama and with a smile which is all I can ask for quite honestly As for the space it s clean and simple with a cool interior balcony on the second floor which lets diners overlook the bar area The fermentation tanks for the beer are also front and center right behind the bar which is cool feature The restaurant did get a little noisy however as the night wore on Finally as for value my sandwich was 11 which I think was reasonable for the portion size so no complaints there Overall I had a good time and would definitely go back if I get the chance 
6raT8TLHgi4tlWO96aQ0CA CMU The average rating for this place is right on point a ok We came here with a relatively large group on a Friday night a little after ten o clock The first floor of the place was packed but we found plenty of space upstairs in the corner which is a pretty weird room considering how removed it is from everything Or waiter was good about taking everyone s drink orders and being patient about it though at one point he gave the right drinks to the wrong people He was also cool about serving us while we played a stupid game with post its on our foreheads We didn t order any food but I was impressed that their kitchen is open so late and the menu is pretty big We were having a fun time until the band came on down stairs The blaring sound was inescapable even though we were kind of removed from where everything was happening The music was so loud it was almost impossible to hear what anyone was saying right next to you In case you re planning to pay with Discover they DO accept it not so cooperative on the check splitting though 
6SkIlpO2G6IYvasG_XxsKg CMU We came here about 3 times and I can t say I had a very good meal here I typically went for the fish and chips because I liked the way they came out to the table in the cone thing but was never that impressed with them Other people that I would eat with would give it so so reviews and so I think that unless you are micro brew type of person this is a check it out if you want but you won t miss anything if you don t 
6tbVTwxqQgT8gdhLkdAzng CMU Are you going here for food or beer This is a crucial question It s a good place for good beer although not cheap Taste the beers first since not all of it is great although much of it is very good I ve found the Dortmunder to be particularly worthwhile The food is a little dicier The calamari is standard by which I mean not great and the mac and cheese is ok but mostly just excessively rich Nonetheless if you actually live in Princeton it elbows in on Teresa s territory as a place that is a in downtown and b has a broad menu with c reasonable quality food and d prices that are not through the roof So it s an ok place for families and birthdays and so on But at the same time there s no real reason to go here just for the food There are worse places in Princeton though 
7-PwC8urOTge2V_N6VwBVQ CMU A little out of the way from downtown Princeton but definitely worth the trip Set in a fairly residential area this bistro style restaurant and wine bar is as cool as anything near Nassau Huge selection of wine but I was quite happy with their selection of bottled beers including Guinness We had a 6 30 reservation and were promptly seated the hostess even took our coats For an appetizer we had one of the specials wild mushroom and caramelized onion tart I ordered the strip steak for my entree and it was tender and juicy slightly more cooked than I like though medium rare My wife had the scallops risotto which she also enjoyed For dessert we had the chocolate bread pudding super chocolaty and rich but balanced well with a scoop of ice cream Their parking lot gets packed but there s plenty of street parking and an additional lot a block away The crowd gave off a yuppie vibe but not so overly pretentious mostly middle aged folks The place gets very packed and cramped so it s definitely advisable to make a reservation you can even do so on opentable com We ll be dining here often So close to 5 stars but not quite more like 4 5 
735O4uKtxXi2FzfzYU4Anw CMU My wife and I did an early Valentines dinner here a few weeks ago It was actually the second time we have eaten here Oh man All I can say is wow The food was excellent Service was fun friendly and helpful What a great dinner The tasting menu paired with wine is a must Sure its expensive but you know that going in and its an occasional splurge for us Doesnt get more romantic great atmosphere too Did I mention how good the food was The 48 Hr Short Ribs was mouth watering We ll be back when I can save up enough money again 
79urt53HZeuykK7B6P72_A CMU The seating was cozy but the wait staff and food were excellent I had a risotto with a pineapple white wine sauce Oh my GOD This was some of the most orgasmic food I have ever eaten 
7EiLTNWqxtTNKl_DeEevtA CMU I ve been into Triumph a few times now while staying in the area but I ve only eaten there once I would probably go 3 5 stars here if I could Beers have always been tasty and I ve got no complaints about the service I ordered a burger and it was a pretty solid pub style burger Nothing mind blowing but certainly did the trick in filling me up and not turning me off The place was packed and I sat at the bar so I can t say much about the table service It s a cool building and if I were to eat here more often I could see myself perhaps upping my rating if other dishes delivered 
7g00Cl32uL-fmTKCgm0CWg CMU Wow I ve spent a lot of time here in the past couple years Always 8 microbrews to choose from I usually go for whichever IPA is on tap Sometimes I give a rare brew a try as well but my friends seem to stick with the Honey Wheat and the Amber Ale which never leave the chalkboard The food is just average The menu changes a lot but I can usually as a vegetarian find one or two items that are ok Many of my friends enjoy the Triumph burger There s always a cover on the weekends as there s always live and loud music 
7gGukzkc4UDsVW3kiX3jEA CMU This is strictly based on the bakery and coffee I wanted to try this place for a while and finally tried it while I went to the post office next door last Summer Aug 2011 The coffee was ok but my wife wasn t that impressed I had a couple of pastry which were just ok too It s really unfortunate I write relatively a bad review because the person behind the counter was very nice and I really loved the ambience Still a pretty cool place to sit and read 
7nSWVwyFDceJ_xH9rBKWJg CMU My boyfriend thinks that the food is great I must ve had the wrong dish Service is great they were prompt and very competent However the restaurant quickly became too loud for me to hear myself speak By the time we got around to leaving I was basically running out the door Overall it s a decent restaurant nothing to rave about I would recommend going with a group of friends and not as a romantic dinner 
7Rr8CXs-rlXIwpA0Y2YW0w CMU Nice imperial stout 
7uYQOn37h5ER_iPW6QAA5A CMU Our favorite special event restaurant in town The crab margarita is a longstanding favorite and so good I had perfectly seared tuna with beautiful vegetables on the side Steaks are good too The dessert sampler is a must and their creme brulee is famous 
7X6UsmAYY7oGTkAl2GfyiQ CMU A classy restaurant except for the fact that it s located next to a gas station Once you step inside though Elements leaves you with no doubt that it s a great restaurant We called in to let the restaurant know that we were going to be late for our reservations since the traffic was horrible because of the heavy rain Elements easily accommodated us When we arrived the hostess rushed out and held the door for us We started off the meal with the complimentary bread cup filled with all sorts of different breads I think I would have preferred good ol olive oil and balsamic vinegar but the bread bowl came with an unique tomato vinaigrette like dipping sauce that was just okay Before our appetizer came Elements sent us a complimentary tuna tartare as an apology for food delay Our appetizer came out quickly after the tartare so the tartare was almost unnecessary Still we greatly appreciated the great care and consideration Elements showed The food was very good and had sophisticated touches to it that made each dish unique and elegant For example the charcuterie appetizer came with a foie gras cookie that I really enjoyed Other elements like black truffle thrown in here or there and rare honey drizzled in the woman at the next table insisted upon knowing what type of flower the honey came from were also significant Perhaps Elements is called Elements for this reason just guessing Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the food and wine She had many helpful suggestions that we found delicious It s awesome that she really knew her stuff and speaks quite a lot about the reputation of Elements Overall Elements seems almost perfect but a few minor quirks here or there prevent me from giving it a full 5 stars It comes close though 4 5 stars 
863RsHSPQKma0837pBxabA CMU Fun place to for a good beer decent band and tasty apps I like to start with the beer sampler and the apps are pretty good The band was really good but was a little too loud couldn t really have a conversation without having to scream 
878yOGM9EVxKfjwWyu7R5Q CMU We went the first Wednesday of the month when they open a unique cask of beer That night s was the Snakebite and I loved it I could really taste the wood of the cask I also got a flight of their beer since I d never been there before My favorite was the raspberry wheat more like a lambic than a generic light fruit beer It was a little too sour for my husband I also really liked the Honey Blonde and would recommend that for beer beginners it tasted like a fresh loaf of bread I also liked the Pilsner I thought it tasted more like honey than the Honey Blonde My husband disagreed We got the poutine as an appetizer which I always love and I got the Epic Burger My husband was jealous the Epic burger clearly outclassed the Triumph burger I wasn t expecting my burger to have both a ground beef patty and the pork belly so I was a little surprised but it was still awesome If I lived in Princeton I would go here all the time 
8CQOnS-A528zczMBHeImGg CMU I d give this place 3 5 stars The fries are quite good I think they ve gotten better since I was here early in the spring or my standards are getting lower now that I live here I had pork belly sliders today deep fried pork belly offset by jicama slaw which may have been a bit too saucy for my taste on very good rolls with a sweet bbq sauce I liked the combo but I like my food to run on the sweet side it might be too sweet for others Service over lunch was quite good water glasses stayed full most of the time I d give it another star but the husband is a beer snob and only thinks this beer is serviceable given the prices compared to our old hometown brewery in Portsmouth NH 
8kK-cbA0Btz8m7y5jIaUNA CMU I doubt all the servers at ONE 53 are rude but how we were treated by our server was appalling My boyfriend and I came to celebrate and we generally look the other way but our server was condescending and my sauteed soft shelled crab lets just say every bite of it tasted like someone heaped a spoonful of salt in my mouth I never got her name but she was a brunette with her hair pulled back in a pony tail She never came to check up on us and when we asked for a second basket of bread she never even bothered We had to wave down someone else to get our bread 15 minutes later appetizer less and sitting at an empty table Either this server is typically rude otherwise we re thinking it might be because we didn t order wine I can t drink and my boyfriend has to drive But really An attitude because we didn t put 20 more dollars on the tab Like I said our server never came to check to see how we were doing never gave us a dessert menu and after waiting for 15 minutes after our meal was finished and had been taken away I had to walk over to the service station to get the check because well she was very good at ignoring us I really recommend couples to go elsewhere to save yourself from an evening ruined I hope ONE 53 s manager reviews this forum I d be happy to be contacted to identify this individual 
8M2i_QH5k3BbRbvmlf0w4A CMU A little too fancy for me The food was great but nothing overly memorable except for the calamari appetizer I had the crab cakes and my colleagues had risotto and a tuna salad Everyone was pleased and the service was great This is not the place to go if you want a big meal for a reasonable price but it is a nice place to go for a special occasion 
8QY7HCsDo63mQ0sQLRNRqQ CMU When Grille is spelled with an e you pretty much know what you are in for a glorified chain restaurant that is designed to make you feel like you are at a fine dining establishment Located in an office park off of Route 1 I was amazed to see that they offer valet parking In an office park Where there is an abundance of parking spots The fact that those guys are stuck out there providing a unnecessary service while being forced to listen to the cheesy music pumped outside made me very sad For what they are trying to do they do it well it s just not really my scene Someone obviously spent some coin building the place but I failed to see the need to have the outdoor fireplaces lit on a freezing cold night It s a big space with high ceilings and no noise control so it s very loud I think it s designed that way so that you feel that you are at somewhere very popular and lively There is a large bar which includes a communal table and a very large dining room The place is packed You can be sure to find the latest sports event on the TVs We showed up without a reservation and sat at the communal table in the bar Our server was great and the food was ok It s the kind of food that sounds a lot better on the menu than it is I started with the lobster bisque which was good For my main course I had their famous pork chop which was much much too salty The portions were huge but it didn t make me want to finish anything on my plate or take it home I d only go back to watch a game and have drinks and appetizers or if I were staying at the Westin and didn t want to go very far Entrees are too expensive for what you get The best money spent at a place like this is the corporate dollar of your expense account and the majority of it on alcohol 
8uwUflaEZhHLYnG81olshA CMU So shocked that Elements fell so flat after reading so many positive reviews 2 stars is really pushing it I just didn t get it I guess The entire experience felt like Elements was trying too hard to be trendy or different For some reason we were seated without menus Waited a few minutes then got the menus and some water Waited some more ordered drinks and waited probably 15 minutes for them Keep in mind it was 1pm and the restaurant was busy but by no means filled to capacity The menu read like one of Andrew Zimmern s adventures on Bizarre Foods Eclectic is one thing but this stuff just wasn t even appetizing Sorry foodies We ended up ordering the burger For 16 it was just ok Heavy on the bacon Much later on coffee was cold and waiter spilled it all over the table Desserts were very sculptural looking but better to look at than to eat Overall decor is contemporary minimalist sort of felt almost clinical Oh and my Mom wanted me to note that the background music was essentially noise On the plus side we weren t rushed and the conversation was great 
8wy4DREDiM4j-MWb3y-VQQ CMU Went on a Saturday night and were able to be seated right away The restaurant was dark and our booth could have been cleaner Our waitress was incredibly annoying She constantly hovered around the table interrupted conversation and was too enthusiastic to the point of insincerity But I ll risk it and go back because the strawberry lemonade was delicious as was the hummus and bruscetta 
91Cwd_VwPN9zH2oIZbUYjQ CMU Despite the fact that the food is grossly overpriced Triumph never fails to satisfy It s great for groups and their beer selection changes periodically Though I ve never been outright disappointed with the food but it s never lived up to its price If you do end up here the Fried pickles are a MUST 
9jNPKYbLm2lfxZ5zHEgy9w CMU My wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the quality of food and outstanding service provided at this rather small neighborhood gem There were items on the menu that are typically hard to find at many of the more well known top notch restaurants zucchini blossoms and lake trout to name a few The caprese salad was excellent as was the zucchini blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese The wine list was pretty extensive although I do wish they had a few more moderately priced bottles All dishes were cooked to perfection The service was extraordinary and our waiter was extremely helpful explaining the menu items and helping us pick the perfect bottle of wine to accompany our dinner Our new favorite spot 
9nW36gPU0NVEZ_VJmG0Eyw CMU My husband and I are first time at Elements in Princeton We both love to try out good cuisine Upscale modern place and ambiance We arrive at the restaurant on Friday eve Excellent concept from the Chef to use local fresh ingredients However need more fine tuning on the entree We both enjoyed the food for starter Jerusalem artichoke soup and especially the desert Sweet potato cake and Coconut almond If you are a big wine drinker please note the selection of wine is very limited With respect of the service from the staff they also need to have a bit more training Fore example ensure the lady sits at first and comfortable before the gentleman at the table Lady s room needs to tightly up run out paper and trash on floor In addition the valet staff also need to open the car door for the lady as well With the amount of the money for the dinner we expect more on the food and the service 
9pC2XTI6l0sOlaFvvqyiKw CMU As others have said overpriced for what you get Not only is it pricey they seem to be stingy on everything My wife ordered the crab cakes and rock shrimp risotto They tasted fine but it looked like they took one crab cake divided it into two and flattened them out so they would look bigger than they are I didn t see a single shrimp in the rock shrimp risotto It was more like a vegetable risotto I ordered sushi The rolls were tiny Not in the number of pieces but the diameter of the roll Imagine a standard California roll that you could get at a supermarket but then take out half the imitation crab and use half the rice It was like that The drinks were nice Would probably go back for that and maybe a sushi roll as an otsumami but I wouldn t do dinner there unless somebody else way paying 
9PLEzGHC5P_QzNVJ4G97aQ CMU Expensive but the food is high quality For daring sushi lovers try the Chef s choice you pick the price either 20 40 60 worth of food tell them which you prefer and the sushi chef makes something up based on what your requests are I said he can be daring and I got the most amazing unique sushi rolls service was great too I have been here twice and the wait staff are very courteous and well humored Not a big fan of the flourless chocolate cake it was a bit too dense had the consistancy of the truffle It was quite rich and very flavorful but consistancy wise I would have liked to taste less like a dense fudge Also I was hoping for a bit more wasabi cinnamon to shine through but the chocolate was too overpowering It was by no means a horrid dessert just wasn t what I was expecting Otherwise I would go here again Thankfully I had a Living Social deal which help me pay for my meal and I still was able to tip generiously 
9qexy7j8bTfRhgTH-ikYCg CMU I ve been to Salt Creek Twice Once about 2 years ago and again about 2 weeks ago Salt Creek would have gotten 4 stars 2 years ago but today I would only give it 1 The service food and experience have all gone downhill I had the Salmon which was HORRIBLE Fishy tough and expensive The waiter was an inexperienced part timer who could care less about us He sat my wife and I in a room with a family of 10 screaming kids Note to Salt Creek When you see a couple come in consider that they may be out for a dinner with out kids and would want to sit somewhere quite You had plenty of seats in the main dining area The only nice feature about salt creek is their bar area Nice fireplaces Although VERY loud The acoustics are so bad in this place you leave with a headache You can hardly hear the person sitting next to you I will not go back to Salt Creek In an area like Princeton Salt Creek should of saw an opportunity to offer consistent service food and experience I blame their demise on poor management with lack of vision 
9rpA48GUTkkPd_CdjjCtYA CMU This place is getting better The wine list is lacking and bar tenders are a major turn off They would be better placed in a dive bar somewhere Pure has some great potential and it is moving the right direction but there are some glaring issues that need addressed My wine glass had lipstick on it When I asked for a replacement she looked at me like I put her out No apology or acknowledgement There are a couple other instances that would make me not want to come back to these bar tenders Side note Saturday night 10 30 about 15 people in the bar 
9S2BQ2m5bryOIK-TtyMX9w CMU As a student I can only justify eating here on a special occasion considering the price It s trendy really the name should have keyed you in modern dimly lit and a great place to have a date well the bar area was going for a casual sports bar with the TV playing the NBA playoff games which kind of detracted from the intimacy But yes definitely the kind of place where you can sense that your wallet will take a hit the moment you walk in Even the salt pepper grinders at the table were really nice We were seated in the center area where all of the tables were seated quite closely together which was a little annoying because it could be quite loud at times with the 4 gossipy ladies next to us and obviously others could probably easily eavesdrop on your private conversation For starters we had a roasted shrimp cocktail which was fine but unexceptional Entree wise we took our waitress recommendations and selected the grilled double pork chop cooked medium rare with chimichurri sauce and the flounder Portions were very reasonable I generally am not a huge fan of pork except in bacon sausage form but this was rich and tender Very well done The hand cut fries were also good The flounder was just as tender but delicate the shrimp were kind of useless except as a garnish The flounder was served on a bed of spinach which was perfectly done just wilted a little crisp but cooked Thumbs up I hate overdone vegetables Thoroughly enjoyed the chocolate bread pudding with caramel bourbon sauce Mmmmm I disagree with other reviews about it being too dry or too bitter Left feeling very stuffed We were so full that we couldn t eat the chocolate ginger cookies left with our check we ll try those tomorrow I d be interested in seeing what this place is like for lunch Probably more reasonable for my budget 
9uKorutQdQVOys28jjYrUw CMU Good venue however the food I ordered was not good Wouldn t recommend for food 
ACVbeJEJW0kqaNB3Ks1FdA CMU What you see is what you get This is a steak and chops heavy restaurant that could be situated anywhere in America except in a city that knows real dining Luckily we had an outside table The inside music was just too loud for normal dinner conversation My steak was nicely prepared however my wild mushrooms on the side were decidedly canned I suppose my hopes were too high Salt Creek Grille has a nice wine list and it is probably a great place for large groups on a week night Otherwise I wouldn t try it without a reservation 
aC_efr_sJUJL-koibQMBQA CMU I ve eaten here maybe 2 x s and each time I ve left regretting paying so much well it s not expensive but dishing out any sort of money for such meh kind of food The decor is nice I guess the tables are made of expensive glass from Europe but the food is again meh During one visit the waitstaff was somewhat attentive while the other time we were checked up on maybe once Which maybe I would have excused if the restaurant was packed but there was one other family in the restaurant other than me and my SO Also I don t know if this has changed but they played really loud music the other time I ve been there 
AeQA2V3xSROLSm9efIol6Q CMU I m a huge believer in not judging a book by it s cover For some reason some people think the term microbrewery automatically means that it s of a high quality I went with friends and an open mind and ordered a pint of the Guinness type dark beer I got my nose over the glass and was punched in the face with smokey beef jerky like aromas When I took a sip I was karate chopped in the neck with some serious off bitter smokey meaty mid palate and finish I had to struggle to finish it I then tried an Irish Red I would probably of liked it if they used about 1 10th the hops 
aervPbicPcPgybHPRT9MlA CMU Burger is amazing My wife had the scallops and loved it Friend had the salmon and thought it was amazing Service was awesome and chef evan came out numerous times and made us feel at home Can t wait to go back for the ribs and pork chops 
AG4gAJLKwGTJegCze5Ej5Q CMU I just don t get it marginal food and not so great beers I ve been there twice and had a tasting of all of the beers and not once did I even consider getting a growler or even a pint of any of the brews on draft It is a beautiful place in the middle of town but just not worth it For lunch I had the deep fried pickles a solid meh and a roast beef sandwich okay but again not great No idea what s actually good on the menu because I couldn t find a winner Best random in the men s restroom the vent ducts allow you to hear clearly what s going on in the seating area directly over head 
AKFmn4q1lzgRyMlNgigu8Q CMU i REALLLLY wanted to be a fan fan fan and I think that next time I will be but my first experience booooooooo i got something off their special menu Bastille Day Menu strip steak au poivre at 41 a pop the cut of meat was TERRRRIBLE there was so much silverskin i couldnt eat like 1 2 the steak cry the flavor was quite good tho tried my friends Rissoni Burger with a whole lotta stuff on it and shrimp angel hair and both were yummy did I mention that the service was omfg slow will definitely try it again but order something else its also pretty pricey even for an expense account 
al4kThon8B4l0hN85OxZ1w CMU Amazing little cafe perfect for a casual lunch The staff is always friendly the food amazing and the dining room is perfect for just chatting or reading a book while you eat 2 favorite foods are the chili and this amazing cheddar chutney cheese sandwich Highly recommend 
alFEJ5XXsWennaLdu_Nx8Q CMU come here when you want to celebrate something special with a long evening filled with great food 
amNH8iUQj9jUiieZqqR7Hg CMU Very average food and way over priced for the quality 
AmtfV59meH6jC1POZaTnvw CMU Just had an odd experience here I ve moved away from cookie cutter establishments but had a gift card and decided to go We had a total of three waiters during the meal and then no one wanted to give us a check From the time we finished our meal to the time we actually left 1 HOUR I d classify that as a catastrophy Not entirely staff s fault I ll explain We ordered drinks with our trainee waiter after she approached us a minute after being seated asking if we d like to order entrees Then her spotter came up and took our apps and entrees Quick side note there is something up with their soda I seriously think they manipulate it somehow because it was so f n delicious Like adding triple the amount of butter to a dish Maybe they re adding butter to the lines Anyway apps come out and I had the French Onion soup Cheese and bread were good the onions cooked properly but was super salty and over seasoned leading me to drink tons of delicious soda We also got the fries with cheese and bacon on it boatloads of artery cloggin fried enjoyment I kept it simple for my entree mushroom swiss burger done medium Well I asked for medium and got well done probably for the better Pretty standard burger and nothing exciting The entree came with fries and pickles So we finish and started to wait for our check There was a bad storm outside so we weren t in a huge hurry About 25 minutes go by before we ask for a bill When we tried to pay the computer was screwed up because of the bad weather another 25 minutes or so We finally see the manager and were taken care of Karma for me going back to national chains 
aOIWR99KXspk6hmp9TRnqw CMU We hosted a big party here in September Our guests are still to this day raving about the food Service impeccable and all the staff just amazing LOVE LOVE LOVE food service and ambience goes beyond the 5 stars possible 
AoKUoLKFV0ie-aimegi9yA CMU They have great restaurant com certificates and the food here is actually pretty decent if different and a little on the pricey side The Bulgarian hot rocks dishes are a specialty as are the kebabs I have had the chicken version of both and been satisfied with the portions and flavor The meat itself was also tender and well marinated You will definitely leave stuffed especially if you order share an appetizer I highly recommend the stuffed mushrooms The desserts are okay but nothing to rave about The bread pudding is probably your best bet if you do decide that you want to finish with a sweet dish Personally I would just trek over to Little Chef Service is friendly if a bit on the slow side Definitely stop by if you re in town It s just one of those landmark places whose reputation is at least semi justified FYI website moved to www princetonrestaurantunderground com 
aQ6PZ-cq5GOvaP1N9EHizQ CMU Modern place Top notch cuisine Valet parking Very crowded Must make a reservation If you re a party of 5 get the private room What is said in the room stays in the room Only saying this since I went out with my girlfriends and the talk we had probably wouldn t be appropriate in a public restuarant Great bonding time The fois gras with mushrooms and broth was exceptional Never had warm fois gras that good It s a must try The branzino was delicious as well but would say typical for these haute type restaurants Ice cream was mediocre a bit icy 
awxu75vLivfwlF281Neo3Q CMU Superb meal Great menu with creative modern American dishes that successfully push the boundary This is just what Princeton needs and is WAY better other more stuffy places I have sampled in the area that charge similar prices Food was perfect especially the 48 hour short ribs with shallots Yum Exciting salads with bright purees flowers and interesting shoots plus locally made lardo which was really good Service was attentive and pitched perfectly Staff were neatly groomed and knowledgeable about the food Great interior Sort of Adirondack California cool Princeton contemporary Delivered on all counts Hope I can be fortunate to visit again next time I am in Princeton 
ayYFzm3og91tsB37iX598w CMU So good Our server Heather was great She was super friendly and very attentive even w multiple tables Try the caesar over misquite It s different but good It s a little pricey but we used a buy one entree get one entree from their facebook page and saved 30 
aZGUU6NwnxTN0Gk4lDpZIA CMU The food was fantastic for the Princeton area Much more enjoyable than Lahiere s though Lahiere s food is great I feel it is overrated and overpriced The Ferry House ranks among my top dinner experiences in Princeton and New Jersey in general BYO great service they let us stay until every other customer had left and we were not rushed at all atmosphere was pretty nice cozy and basic bread and butter with herbs was wonderful especially after being in the cold outside I d recommend getting dessert elsewhere if you re looking for something unique We had the creme brulee and it was pretty standard and the other options on the menu were pretty conventional too This place really is outstanding for their seafood entrees though 
aZKJkM8sSLw0kPe6k3oWSA CMU TIP Purchase a 25 restaurant com gift certificate before going Usually it has huge discounts My friend got a 25 coupon for only 2 But just make sure to call ahead to confirm you can use it on that day Waitress was ultra friendly and food came out fast I especially liked the mushroom appetizer The portions are quite large so I ordered an appetizer and my friend got an entree for use both to share The hot rocks combo was pretty yummy and made me stuffed 
B1HNGDA_1AG-a_chRD_6XQ CMU Elements doesn t really need extra press on the internet but they say word of mouth is the best thing to go by so I ll review them for the meal I had back in April of this year It was my birthday and Pat surprised me with chef s table at Elements something I d been wanting to do for quite some time It was thunderstorming outside which added dramatically to the evening when the valet opened my door for me and umbrella d me all the way to the door Nice touch Pat and I sat down with Mattias as the bartender something that everyone should try before they sit down to have dinner He s amazing Mild but very intense at the same time Seeing him shake a martini was extremely entertaining And at one point he excused himself in the middle of making a drink and came back with flecks of rain on his glasses Haha and I was like why did you go outside and he was like I was picking sage Sure enough he was burning a sage leaf over this drink like a voodoo wizard Or whatever sect of magic that comes from Whatever it takes to create the experience I guess Anyway so chef s table To add a bit of flare to the evening and because Pat is such a damn sweetheart he brought some pints of bent spoon ice cream from work to share with the kitchen staff and the service staff They were very grateful This is something I suggest to everyone who works in the borough Uh share the wealth it s nearly free advertising a genuinely nice thing to do and others will be more inclined to share with you OK now for the food The amuse bouche was fabulous Flaky pastry crusts holding lovely filling crunchy cracker with steak tartare terrine with impeccable smoothness a carrot ginger gelee on a chinese spoon The theme of the evening was evident from that moment perfection in texture Chef Scott is a frickin scientist when it comes to the delicate faction of cuisine that determines texture Everything was expertly intricately and meticulously controlled to the point where I was chewing way way slower than I was perhaps meant to just to savor the expertly brunoise potatoes chewy brownie or crisp pastry or crunchy sea salt or flaky fish or foamy foam or fudgey cookie or rich liver or rubbery mushrooms or smooth gelato or tender pork That was alphabetical but I didn t mean to do that Crazy OK I went back and fixed a couple but they were mostly alphabetical anyways Texture aside the food itself was flavorful to the point of being too salty but it s obvious that Chef Scott has a love affair with asian flavors so the salt is understandable One dish in particular was the baked potato in a cup We were instructed by our server to dive down with our spoons and get every layer in one bite At the bottom were perfectly square perfectly cooked potatoes in a rich sauce layered with creme fraiche chives probably cheese but I don t remember and little rocks of sea salt that when you crunched down opened the entire dish for a moment but then washed it out with a wave of ocean salt It was moments like that where I wished there was just a touch less Otherwise oh me oh my what delicious food I would recommend chef s table to anyone who is planning a nice dinner in the area It s expensive of course but completely worth the experience and perhaps more worth it than sitting in the restaurant itself Honestly the privacy is something that you just can t get anywhere else in the spacious modern dining room I ve sat in there for lunch since and much preferred my up close and personal experience sitting in the kitchen What a great idea 
B2K3JT2jTLo07i_y8vpJ_Q CMU Great for food and a beer Triumph has a great selection of fresh brews the Oatmeal Stout is my favorite Princeton isn t a place for nightlife go to Philly instead They actually just opened up a second Triumph location in Olde City Philly less than a year ago and it s a little more nightclub esque 
B3gYHhUfO8TuR_vFP9aaVQ CMU Sushi was fantastic We also ordered a steak and it was also very good The only issue was that they ran out of something in the drink I had ordered and I ordered something else no biggie I m not too picky with that Overall it s expensive but everything was delish The waitress was wonderful She was Italian and was very nice We spent around 100 but it was lovely Not an everyday dinner place but good for dates and special occasions 
b4DbvW0CYqWU0E2-3e8tgg CMU Having lived in Princeton a while back I can only ask why this restaurant was not around when I lived there It is the much needed oasis in the culinary desert Nice decor professional service and good food Brunch is pretty good and I would recommend it 
betmP4D99QOqRVR1B7rEkQ CMU I truly appreciate then menu range because I can always find something The burgers are pretty juicy and flavorful and the salmon toro tartare is very fresh The butternut squash ravioli is deliciously creamy and a great comfort dish Service is usually very friendly and fast although that can vary Overall a good place for a diverse group because it has something for everyone 
biHSELoWSypSIH1yNJxcLQ CMU I like it but it is kinda of stuffy and they don t have a liquor license so you have to bring your own Not the same as being able to order a vodka martini before dinner The food is good and serving sizes are big enough We had dinner here with another couple and dropped some serious coin not to mention the champagne and wine I had to buy before hand 
bkLfupXbXSUud8yE7DFZ7w CMU Awesome food 
bnl5jM6jC3hDDnGdChQHdA CMU Great atmosphere Lamb chops were terrific Service was good and accommodating to our schedule 
bnmb3CIb53Hj1-37dGivaw CMU Well there is just no denying it Salt Creek Grille is a fun place to go Last night my hubby and I took out a few of our employees for some drinks and food We had to work a bit late and one of our employees David was celebrating his 28th birthday Anyway the music was great the food and service was wonderful and you just can t beat the warm cozy atmosphere of all those fireplaces Lucky me that Salt Creek is a block from my Princeton shop I never need much of an excuse to go for a drink and some snacks 
bR-k_Y7er_EvpP4CmzYIzQ CMU So maybe we weren t ordering the right food I m not really sure but I had a really good experience here on New Years Eve I m told and see from reviews that the one in New Hope is better guess I gotta try it So my boyfriend and I went here around 9 30pm and expected hordes of people We found the last two seats and the bar downstairs The Drinks Started off with their Winter Wonder and Bohemian Pilsner ales personally I liked the Winter Wonder better it had some great spices Review for the Bohemian Pilsner is in my previous review The Food Tuna Tacos really really good Oh my god I am NOT a nacho taco fan but this was great The tuna was in this creamy queso sauce with fresh pico de gallo Grass Fed Beef Triumph Burger very tasty and cooked JUST the way I like it I was in heaven The meat was perfectly medium rare and the fries were great too Pulled pork burger I didn t try this myself but my boyfriend said it was very good They also did this midnight champagne toast which was cute All in all the service was fantastic given the incredibly busy night they had and they were very friendly Bottomline I guess you just have to go through the menu till you find something you really like 
bRlkLwMIOQEFKoGrHZOslQ CMU The moment you walk in you ll notice the modern feel that s colorless Unless you have good company that atmosphere becomes boredom because the service was very elementary poor The 3 types of bread is a wonderful compliment but the waitstaff to refill your water leaves you parched You ll notice them walk around only filling one glass and leaves everybody near empty It took about 10min to finally order and about another good 10 min before I actually received my first cocktail drink I ordered 4 apps and the whole wasted experience dragged on for 2 hours The foie gras torchon is skimpy on the foie for 17 but makes up for the sour cherry and brioche The sardines were wonderful The following two apps were a disaster The cavatelli had very little king crab to even notice The pasta was al dente however there was no sauce which left a dry mouth and having no water I was really parched I asked for more sauce and got a version that was so salty is was inedible I was disgusted and hoped my short rib was better NOPE The sauce the short rib came on was congealed and not a reduction Some person with long blond hair should ve been modeling and not preparing food I guess prep cook came out and asked if I liked it I said it looked like jello he said that s how it is prepared I have never seen a short rib dish prepared with sauce that is so congealed when you brush it with your fork it becomes a glob of jello This was definitely not a form of molecular gastronomy if you ask Chef Wiley Dufresne This was too much arrowroot or flour used I hope Chef Anderson doesn t bring tonight s cook with him when he cooks at the James Beard House in July Tonight June 25 the failed sauces for both apps doomed the hype of this restaurant highly rated by Zagats and NJ Monthly I m not a chef but I know how good food is prepared I ve eaten at probably 75 of the James Beard Michelin Star winners A friend has eaten there and says it s good I guess it s just not consistent It s definitely not worth the hour drive to Princeton to experience hit miss food Fine dining should not be this way Yes I ve driven 2 1 2 hrs to eat at Arrows Restaurant in Ogunquit ME stopping by Portland for the day and was not disappointed by the James Beard Chef Finalists as I was driving home late at night Call me crazy but I search for exquisite food BTW the wine pour is a crime to charge mid teens prices for a 3oz pour 
bRT_l0MoptiyFwj5NZInIw CMU I spent New Year s Eve with my sweetheart at elements and were impressed by the dining experience in particular the boldness of flavors that graced our palates We are admittedly not accustomed to upscale gastronomy but wanted to try to 5 course tasting menu to sample the experience As far as tasting menus we were surprised by the small portions but understood by the end of the meal that everything added up to ensure our satiety We did not have wine with our meal so cannot comment on the quality of the pairings Prior to our first course we were served an amuse bouche a potato leek vichyssoise that was delicious and cleansed our palate Even my sweetheart not the biggest fan of daring accents of flavor during this course enjoyed the offering For our first course we had the foie gras torchon and composed salad of citrus buratta avocado and absinthe I savored the buttery texture and flavor of the foie gras particularly when mixed with the tarragon sherbert not too different from foie gras dishes at other restaurants I ve been too but still well executed I also tried the salad but was less impressed by the flavor profile the buratta was tasty however and was a new flavor for us I wonder if the absinthe confused our palates During our second course we both had the crispy skate with onion ring potato salad and remoulade The fried skate was cooked perfectly though the fried coating was thick in some places It mixed well with the tartar sauce like remoulade The potato salad was fantastic and the onion ring was very light similar to ones served at Cheeburger Cheeburger Our third course was the pasta course in which we had the chestnut agnolotti stuffed with smoked ricotta and cavatelli highlighted by celery root The chestnut agnolotti similar to ravioli was perhaps the best dish of the evening an explosion of the succulent ricotta flavor with each bite The cavatelli was also delicious although reminiscent of a cream of spinach one of my favorites During our meat course I had dared to try the dry aged wagyu beef We were told it was a rare beef in the states and it really had the melt in your mouth wow factor I certainly enjoyed the 2 oz on my plate My sweetheart had the 48 hour sous vide short rib and loved it as well We concluded with the chocolate souffle which screamed pure indulgence It was complemented well with a homemade pistachio ice cream Overall we loved the bold flavors and their progression throughout the meal from the lightness of the vichyssoise the smoothness of the foie gras the parcels of sweet ricotta in the agnolotti and the savory wagyu beef a pleasurable journey that relaxes into the warm sweetness of the souffle Some other thoughts Absolutely beautiful exterior and the interior boasted an edgy modern design The ambiance was very elegant although the lighting was a bit dark Expect to use the valet parking I felt I didn t have a choice The service was exceptional and courses were brought out in perfect timing The bread basket had its own highlights and did much to fill the rest of our stomachs in light of the small portions of the meal The petit fours at the end offered a nice variety of sweet tastings 
bS8rv1CpOiwiroD-M0Ct7g CMU I think I ve tried to trick myself into liking Triumph more than I actually do Ok not saying that I don t enjoy it the beer is good but not amazing as is the food It s definitely the best place for night life in the area The one thing I wanna know is why is there a cover at night on the weekends For a usually crappy band no less Another thing that can either be a great or a horrible thing depending on which people they are my mood and how drunk I am is that I always see people i went to high school with there Triumph is definitely worth a try at least for the microbrewed beers 
bX0nrTSp_tcwvuij3ojjCw CMU I LOVE this Triumph location I consider it my bar It is a bit small which is usually cozy and warm but can be a bit loud when there is music The staff is super friendly and attentive They often have happy hour specials and small events though the New Hope location is definitely more happening The beer is what draws me in it is DELICIOUS and there is always something new or special to order I rarely come here to eat the portions are small and though creative the dishes leave me unimpressed The fries are great though and the beer more than makes up for what the rest of the menu lacks 
by0XSbSFLaLfx-_qQFE5WQ CMU While on my travels through Croatia I ate at a seaside restaurant that delivered me terrible service though the food was good The couple next to me started talking to me they guessed I was from NY due to the constant checking of my blackberry in a foreign country and they were right Next thing I know they tell me I should check this joint out I think to myself yeah when am I ever going to be down near Princeton Well a week after returning guess where I find myself For the record it was because of a girl why else right So what did we start with hmm the grilled caesar salad which was served on one piece of lettuce though a large piece and very tasty Salmon tartare was the other starter and was pretty solid as well For the mains we went with the swordfish and the duck risotto The swordfish was cooked well but I thought could ve been seasoned a little stronger The risotto was really good but the duck part was slightly overcooked and thus on the dry side Dessert was grilled peaches with ice cream which was really good Literally a peach cut in half put on the grill and then topped with ice cream So good yet so satisfying Overall I put this spot at 3 5 stars But I m comparing that to what I get to eat everyday in Manhattan so maybe this is a 4 for the area Just be warned it s easy to blow through 200 on a date here so for all you kids on that college budget over there make sure she s worth it 
byJGfIV2-UesqvMOTqdtxw CMU OMG I do NOT know how this place is still in business I had a friend visiting from out of town we decided to give the place a try My love for exotic food enticed me in The food really wasn t too bad This is where things got horrible an enormous amount of FLIES circled around the dining room Not one not two but packs Sounds comical but it wasn t Years ago my father owned a diner everyone knows that where there are flies there is spoiled food It was the summer people could say some got in but it wasn t some The server came over and I quote I so sorry for flies we have someone coming in to spray for them ARGHHHHHHH needlessly to say we left as did another group of people This place was not clean I would be afraid to see the kitchen Keep in mind this was the summer of 2009 so perhaps someone came out to spray by then My advice STAY AWAY 
bzqvKeC-Phq3SNPnLI2ECA CMU My dinner party sat downstairs in the wine room The food was wonderful I highly recommend the soft shell crab 
C0-6eGAYzuCJp9U9i9y3fw CMU I just returned from possibly the best meal I ll ever eat My wife 11 year old daughter and I had dinner at Elements tonight and it was unbelievable First the drinks are inventive and balanced Jamie is working some serious magic behind the bar I had the el Diablo and there s a perfect blend of fruit tequila and just the right amount of spice Loved it However the tasting menu took center stage tonight It started with sea trout three ways and was followed by hazelnut soup with foie gras amazing creamy and the foie gras went so well with the hazelnut Third course was a smoked australian fish can t remember the name now but the blood sausage sauce with it worked perfectly The best part tonight was the Scottish hare which was thinly sliced to perfection and served with homemade tagliatelle hare sausage and some beats The rabbit liver butter which I considered dropping in my pocket for later was heaven in a little ramekin The cheese course that closed out the menu was fun a creamy and ripe local cheese fondue with skewers of bread speck ham and apple My wife and I have been lucky enough to enjoy several occasions in the capable and inventive hands of Scott Anderson and his team I always love how he brings creativity to each dish and he s able to strike a balance between creating his own style while keeping the experience refreshing and unexpected each time I ve had the chance to eat at top restaurants in NYC Philly and DC Tonight Elements outclassed some of my recent trips to Hearth and Prune NYC and America Eats DC And the service here is great From the valet to the servers everyone is polite without being stuffy The wine list has plenty of interesting finds and Justin is always ready with a good recommendation 
C1RLIu2bnMd5JY7VfKcR-w CMU Fancy fancy fancy french Love this food so delectable Need to be dignified and whatnot everyone speaks quietly 
C4aePX5xjPje_Ms7KSsgjg CMU One of the better Houlihan s I know chains are supposed to be the same but you and I both know that s not true No matter where you go the mgr the staff the bartenders etc make a difference With that in mind this Houlihan s seems to work better than the one on Rt 18 and the one on Rt 22 Drinks seem to come out faster the food comes out hotter etc than at the others Also love the fact that it s open so late I fly alot and find my self at PHL at midnight more times than I care to think about I can still get to Houlihan s and get food bar menu only and drink until 1 55am Love it 
C4nP0TnjwTMdj1QGNnXKRQ CMU I ve been to the Salt Creek Grill 3 times and all 3 times the food and the service have been subpar I can overlook service if the food is good but the food is definitely not good I ve ordered three different items each time thinking maybe they just had an off night but this was not the case It s a shame too because this place has good ambiance minus the terrible acoustics and blasting live music from the bar area and the menu makes sense There s a good reason why this place gets so many bad reviews the food is not good and that being said it makes the prices even harder to swallow I offer two pieces of advice 1 Get rid of ALL kitchen staff and start over by hiring a new head chef An excellent chef would never allow ill prepared food to leave his her kitchen If you want to put high prices on your menu you need a chef who can execute the orders Period 2 The live music in the bar area good idea because people like live music but this music is not contained in this area as the acoustics are terrible here and spills over into the dining area to the point where you have to shout yes literally shout it s that loud across the table as if you re at a club After 10 pm fine but during dinner hours no this is not acceptable Either turn down the amps or tell these guys to show up at 10 pm 
C7FFcV5UVn4UXzrilGLUSw CMU Go for the drinks and the atmosphere but skip the food The hummus was too spicy the kabobs were like rubber and the fish with the fish and chips was a really small portion 
c7hwTj7dEYvlLm0PTfRixg CMU Sunday Brunch Food and service was good Everyone from the Maitre d to the server were very accomodating The sweet potato spread was delicious on enquiry they even gave us some to take home Very good vegetarian options 
C7IrDDe-H7evm0V5tpfL3w CMU Mexi fusion One of the best meals I have ever had A client hosted me and a colleague my really nice boss to dinner at the Ferry House and it was truly exceptional The three of us started with their signature Lump Crab Margarita It is a huge handful of lump crab mixed with avocado scallions and a oli with Old Bay on the rim of a Margarita glass A couple tortilla chips to shovel all this crab on your fork Just damn good I enjoyed crab stuffed Mahi Mahi atop garlic mash potatoes and asparagus Mussels and clams surrounded this pile of goodness My host knocked down Jumbo Prawns and Seared Sea Scallops panned fried in with Cherry Tomato Butter My boss ordered Salmon set on Crab Crusted Portobello Mushroom French Bean fired in a Red Beet Saute A Pecan Tort with homemade coffee ice cream was all mine Perhaps you can call the service slow but I d rather think of it as pacing a great meal to enjoy 
CAmdiWhlzdik5JOIDyzXCA CMU Elements is the only gourmet restaurant that I know of in Princeton There are many restaurants with good food but if you are looking for white tablecloth attentive service a complimentary welcome bite from the kitchen solid wine card elegance and upscale feel this is the place to go The charcuterie platter appetizer was excellent and the venison was really good too but could perhaps had a bit more interesting sides garniture With a glass of wine it was a very nice meal It s not cheap but I think you get what you pay for I was torn between 4 and 5 stars but service was impeccable so I m rounding up 
CBxNRtnwh-RT42vhniUZcQ CMU I dined at Pure tonight and left with mixed feelings The staff were all very nice courteous attentive some of them even fun and cheerful The food and drinks were overpriced for the quality and portions Fried curry oysters all 5 were tasty but very fried tasting All of their salads sounded tasty the confit with duck leg thigh salad was quite good and I was pleased with the serving size We ordered the 40 chef s choice and got 5 pcs sushi an Alaska roll tuna yellowtail salmon red snapper sashimi The fish was fresh Considering what we had already spent on a small sake and some wine nothing on the dessert menu intrigued us enough to buy it Our meal in general tasted good but left us feeling like something was missing The emphasis is definitely on image at this place though some of the wait staff were a bit awkward I would recommend this place to a friend but I ll probably not go back I can spend the same amount elsewhere and get twice as much food but of course I wouldn t be sitting on a shiny gold chair in a pool of red light coming down from a massive chandelier 
ceXGzIgetDpvCjOIPMjmLQ CMU Is the NJ monthly a reputable source to rate the best burgers of NJ Well the latest poll from their article showed that this joint has the 4th best burger in NJ 3rd in Central NJ but 1st in the Princeton Skillman area With that standing why not give it a try right We arrived as a party of 4 after a game of tennis unchanged from our sweaty attire and were slightly surprised they still seated us Maybe because it was a Wednesday night maybe the establishment doesn t have a dress code but either way it worked out well for us We all ordered a beer and its award winning burger while here Although it was a decent burger it didn t live up to my expectations of what I expected I like eggs on my burger and I wish more people who offer that as an option when serving gourmet burgers The bacon was supposedly applewood smoked But I didn t really taste the applewood flavor even when I ate my bacon independently of the burger to taste for it In the end it was a filling gourmet bacon burger with an egg on top which is not a novel concept Not a failed first time experience at the inn but it didn t engage me to return anytime soon 
CiAbyDFgsC6i4LHeT0SPzA CMU Me and my boyfriend had lunch here today and by far the best Advocado and Cucumber Rolls we have ever tasted The freshness in the vegetables was there you can taste it The customer service was very polite and gentle and the ambiance is so awesome it almost had me not wanting to leave Highly recommend it 
cIDhZOyY8X23DMAY8zI39g CMU I ve been to Salt Creek Grille a number of times in the last month The decor is great it looks like a ski lodge as others have commented I especially like the fireplace Food is good although overpriced they have a prix fixe menu that includes soup salad a choice of 3 entrees and a chef s choice desert While it is nothing exciting I like the house salad it includes yummy candied walnuts Service is very attentive the last time I was there my friend s meal wasn t prepared to order and they fixed it quickly and gave him a genuine apology The big downside of this restaurant is the acoustics it can be really loud 
CIiTPxFVzz4Jclar0Fw0bQ CMU After waiting a significantly long time we finally got in on our reservation at nine o clock at night I forgave because apparently some party group threw of the reservation schedule by arriving an hour late The food was pretty good Some sort of soy sauce sweet and sour calamari to start and a chicken and shrimp dish as my entree Good stuff Kinda pricey though but maybe it s just my grumpiness weighing my rating down 
ciKFh33TzuL5jtHRghUsjw CMU I have been to this place several times now and every time has been worse than the last Tonight marks the end I will never return to Triumph We ordered a Scallop Po Boy and the Epic Burger The po boy was disgusting Was that a roasted tomato or pepper I think I deserve to know It s rude to serve something unidentifiable for more than 10 And now the fiance is reminding that the scallops of this Scallop Po Boy were nowhere to be seen There was something fried in there but a scallop I don t know As for this Epic burger Yuck It looked like many items I ve seen on thisiswhyyourefat com It was just a mess of monochrome meat and onions Totally unappetizing to look at totally disgusting to eat I am getting indigestion just thinking about it Also Triumph smells like pea soup and cleaning fluid I lose my appetite when I walk in the door I kind of wish I could give it zero stars but I think they deserve one star for featuring Elina Lorenz s art Good job Triumph but you still need to learn how to cook 
CivGXkXwmbGAUnZ23CP-EA CMU The food here was pretty good and I would definitely eat there again The menu items seemed a bit expensive for what they were The only reason we tried it was because we had a very nice gift certificate which made it totally worth it The service was very good once we got seated At the bar and the host table the service was not memorable We started with teh SCG Chips which were outstanding Probably the best part of our meal We also got the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer which was pretty good I then had the Porterhouse Stroganoff and my fiancee had the filet The entrees were good but not outstanding Finally for dessert we got creme brulee which was standard and very good It was good but not great and a bit too pricey for what it is Like I said before we had a very generous gift card 
ci_9NJ5GefI8IiiqvgIAXA CMU This is a gem that locals like we are who commute to NYC where there are many fine dining opportunities appreciate for the quiet elegance and delicious food The service is prompt from the Maitre to table service mature fun and friendly After a long week of slogging it at work etc this is a great estuary to enjoy your dining company ambience food and drink The One 53 Martini will set you off in the right direction Good for mature well behaved kids rowdies please go down the street to the Tiger Tale 
ckwScHxB5Lqc5yHHiBavxQ CMU This is my second visit to Salt Creek Grill The first time I have to say I was not a fan The atmosphere was very loud and the food was average I was back July 19 2010 I have to say it was a much better experience I had a gift card so I was ready It was 1 2 price bottle of wine great deal and a good variety We had the calamari app It was cooked very well and tasty The meals we also cooked well and quite tasty The atmosphere is still a bit loud 
CnQ-wTSpoZ87ZpIOGoqmUQ CMU The cheesecake and food are good but be prepared to wait Do not go here for a work lunch It will take over an hour 
cpkWeUspkE3JPB4aRejyjQ CMU Awesome atmosphere with a lofty feel Burgers are really really good and the chipotle aoli for the fries is great I ve been here probably a dozen times and the beers are good but I ve never really been blown away by any of them I actually had to send back a barleywine one time because it tasted exactly like Robitussin Their standard session ales are usually spot on though 
CpTDS9ru8eCMUojfENnkAQ CMU What a great place The food is superb and there is a very nice selection of reasonably priced wines plus some very very good wines I liked the casual friendly environment which added to the ambiance The wine cellar is a special treat for dinner There is nothing better than attending a wine tasting with Jeff the manager and sommelier and then having dinner 
CqRRdyQHj6fIULw7lZBV6A CMU I wish I had read the recent reviews because they are spot on This restaurant is horrific I live in Manhattan and serendipitously found out about elements through another restaurant at which I like to eat in another city Atelier Crenn I was surprised I had never heard of this restaurant or this chef considering the amount I eat out and read about restaurants so I very much wanted to try it thinking this may be a gem in the middle of nowhere a la Blue Hill at Stone Barns I called and made a reservation through Beth at the chef s table for their 9 course tasting I was told the chef would probably pull out all the stops given how I found out about the restaurant I asked how many seats were at the chef s table and I was told 10 I asked how many others would be at the table and I was told I was the only one It was a Tuesday night so I thought super at least I won t have to compete with others for the staff s attention Boy was I wrong Incidentally this is not a chef s table this is a set of three tables in an open room adjacent to the kitchen The tasting started fine with three fairly crappy amuses The first was what looked like a rock it was a croquette When you cut into it stringy goo came out The next amuse was a sashimi fish dish that actually smelled like fish and tasted old and unhealthy That should have been my first clue as to how the night was going to go but I am an optimist at heart and tried to remain positive After three amuses course after course of absolutely unimpressive food was delivered although one tomato dish was intriguing and decent Some dishes had too much heat some weren t seasoned enough some had so much food I felt like I was going to explode it was mostly bland The octopus was chewy and dry he wagyu beef chewy Very few people came around to see how I was doing including the chef who is an arrogant troll This restaurant is riddled with stunning arrogance from the chef down to the runners Normally great chefs visit the dining room to see how things are going and to explain parts of the meal Especially during a tasting I have had access to some of the country s best chefs except for Scott Anderson whom I almost mistook for a bus boy if someone had not pointed him out as the chef Do not be seduced by the photos on his website which is what motivated me to spend 4 hours in the car driving from Manhattan to Princeton roundtrip and spend more than 50 in gas and tolls I can assure you not one person cared that I went to such extremes to eat this cook s food except two people Amy the manager who has three star poise and Alliana spelling a food runner who also demonstrated poise and professionalism They were the two individuals who are fish out of water here their service level was so high it belongs in a proper Michelin starred restaurant which elements will never become All others were rookies poorly trained knew nothing about the food were stupid arrogant dumbasses and didn t know how to interact with human beings You cannot retrain people who have not had proper role models in their parents They are irreparably broken Here is where the fun starts As the night wore on I became so bored with this pathetic food that I began to lean back in my chair it wasn t an especially attractive or fragile chair Then an insolent kid arrogantly comes over to tell me to stop leaning back in my chair JUST before my last course I was almost out of there Now if someone says it politely you apologize profusely but when someone comes over and demands that you stop leaning in a chair at a restaurant of this supposed caliber well let s just say a shouting match ensued I demanded my check in between f bombs didn t finish my last course and left Before I did Scott Anderson came over to defend his lad asking me not to call him an a hole I thought he was coming to apologize like most normal restaurants would do I told him he was an a hole and deserved to be called one Nevertheless I tipped 20 even though I wanted to leave nothing for two reasons because there were a few people that didn t make my night bad and who tried and so that the people who were rude to me can wear it as a badge of shame knowing they didn t deserve it and that the others carried them This restaurant is an imposter masquerading as a new american restaurant I have already warned all of my Princeton friends Shame on you Scott Anderson for running a terrible restaurant with staff equally as terrible You should all be ashamed of yourselves for having no standards 
crf2qwVjdhtnrk54-IRkLA CMU MMM BEERS had a very nice ale there it was good food very good had the prime philly steak sandwich very much worth it and very lagre in size staff friendly and sharp gh 
CTcpAwviywoXWcBqEYYa4g CMU 2nd time here with 7 friends Last time I ever come back too this sh box My friends agree If I could give this place a negative rating I would 3 hours slow service done Wasted enough time at this place On a Saturday evening where this place should be packed and I may understand 3 hour service but the place was half empty lol I think people are catching on and found a better spot to dine Good riddances Calamari was more like a soup bleh Tilapia was my main and it was good Had some chocolate cake and the pecan pie both horribad Chocolate cake tasted like a melted hersey s bar and the pecan s in the pie were so grounded up all you tasted was sugar and crust bleh oh and I didnt realize how bad the little flies were I read other reviews and lol Come on guys how do you have flies everywhere inside you guys have a dead body in the basement They were annoying horrible Place 
c_1fyDbRiYNPjurN8yPArA CMU The Ferry House is an excellent choice for a date night or a celebratory dinner The atmosphere is nice and the food is excellent The Ferry House was pleased to accomodate this vegetarian with a risotto sampler which was much appreciated as there are no vegetarian items listed on the menu Prices are high but again the food is very good 
d0GKB2GEkWiW4j0_6a1A5Q CMU I must say I was impressed by this place Not so much the service that was par but the beers and foodstuff were great My table ordere a few beers while we waited to be seated each sampled one of the microbrews and they were all really good I particularly enjoyed the Imperial Stout though like most stouts I probably wouldn t be able to drink more than one of those without feeling full French Onion Soup good cheese bread soup ratio though the broth was super salty Hummus Plate I liked that they had a spicey relish on top gave it a good kick Hangar Steak subbed salad for shoestring fries steak cooked perfectly and the salad had figs and goat cheese Delicious but I bet those parmesean fries would have been fantastic too Overall a good time good atmosphere too Will probably make another trip back and order the beer sampler 
d6MeMXjkrTb1qsF1Lj9hww CMU Unfortunately the Ferry House lives up to the stereotype of Princeton restaurants over priced and underwhelming Although the staff was attentive the ceviche appetizer was unoriginal the duck entree was tough and the chocolate dessert that tried to be innovative was dry and flavorless Go elsewhere 
dDBhec6N9MloncWnY96CDA CMU Considering that my flower shop provides the flowers for Underground Kevin and I have never eaten here We had heard the food was very good and was highly rated and we were not disappointed The atmosphere was very nice and comfortable Our server was attentive and amazed us with her ability to tell us about all the night specials four very involved meals I had the stuffed pepper which were not only tasty but quite filling Kevin had the lamb special that was also wonderful In honor of their 4 year anniversary they treated all of us to a wonderful starter that consisted of 4 different appetizers That was especially wonderful especially the stuffed mushroom and the spinach crouquets Because we wanted to try a dessert that was unique we tried their Bulgarian bread pudding That was very nice and the perfect ending to a very pleasant meal I see the reviews are rather mixed but we really enjoyed our meal 
devNDHjoulv8DkCAS40hWQ CMU April 1 2011 First time at Elements in Princeton My SO and I went on a Friday night so the dining room was pretty full The pictures online were deceiving as the space is relatively small however it never felt cramped or crowded We were a bit close to the tables around us which provided for some entertaining eavesdropping especially as the wine got flowing We both ordered the tasting menus with wine pairings as part of the Foodie Fridays feature There were 5 courses with 2 additional from the chef bites The early courses were good but nothing outrageous I could have done without the Uni and geoduck as it wasn t quite what my palate was wanting at the time Once we got to the substantial courses the chef began to shine The sea bass was very very good I actually don t remember how it was prepared but I don t recall it being anything complicated just good Next was a geoduck linguine with broccoli which was quite good once I mixed it up A lot of the pieces of goodness sank to the bottom of the dish and weren t well integrated with the pasta so my first couple bites were bland Then came the partridge which once we got past the immature entertainment of the claw being still attached and quietly singing C mon Get Happy was excellent Yes we were enjoying the libations I have never had partridge but I likened it to turkey but better than the best turkey I have ever had The cheese course came out and the waitress was oddly hesitant I know why now The cheese was overly smokey and neither of us really liked it at all This was disappointing considering I really like artisan cheeses The great part was the waitress acknowledged that it is a cheese that only certain people like so she offered us any dessert in place on the house We looked at the menu and decided to each get a dessert as we couldn t agree on one to split Both were outstanding To top it all they actually comped us for both desserts Totally unsolicited and unnecessary but very gracious I must say also that the wine pairings throughout were perfect During one course which I don t quite recall the wine they brought before I didn t like at all on its own and neither did my girlfriend However being a pairing menu veteran I tried it with the dish and wow it was not only tolerable but was a great complement and ended up finishing the glass I will definitely return to Elements as often as my wallet will allow and look forward to see how the tasting menu changes with the seasons 
dG5zPTAEF4RYdB8q_Ned6g CMU Nice chic bar restaurant on Naussau right across the street from Princeton The ambience was lively but unfortunately we got seated in a section that seemed private at first but ended up being the loudest and most obnoxious part of the entire restaurant due to a group of 15 loud drunk idiots The food quality was average at best but they did have a unique selection of dinner items which included chicken lolliops deep fried pickles salmon pastrami and moules frites It was a fun place to go and would have been a better experience if not for our new friends seated next to us The layout of the place was pretty cool especially the long hallway as you step inside the restaurant 
dhByNWLZrnqIzY-ePmNkeg CMU I ve eaten here a few times and the food is delicious I always order the sausage shish kabobs and I ve not been disappointed Even the white rice is delicious lol there s something deliciously different about it I can t put my finger on what it is though Try Underground you won t be disappointed 
Dj4GDy1ziFzNibIrPgfh9g CMU I can t say enough good things about Ferry House We had a phenomenal dinner a few weeks ago we haven t stopped talking about it The service was wonderful the food was out of sight We split the bisque the crab margarita appetizers Due to my tomato allergy I couldn t have their guacamole at the bottom of the margarita so they gave me a double serving of crab It was delicious Foodie Boyfriend loved his venison shrimp entree my mahi mahi was perfectly prepared Bring a fabulous bottle of wine to match their incredible food Now that we re back in LA we regret that we didn t go back for a second night 
dk8WFkgi77T4Oz3TvK-Nfg CMU Not a bad place We stopped in for lunch and sat at the bar The 3 courses for 15 is a deal We came at noon and it wasn t packed The decor and ambiance are 5 Stars The food is good but didn t wow me then again it was lunch The service was good I will be back to try dinner 
dPd96bv0XPYXiOMNv_586A CMU I went back again with another LivingSocial voucher and had another great meal without any hassle Very good service and delicious food 
DPU4Tu2OSNWon5e7qhHGKA CMU Triumph is quite a good brewpub really I have been coming here for 10 years and recently returned after a long hiatus I ve tried many brewpubs across the land Triumph s selections are still quite impressive Part of the reason for this may be a lack of adventurism The beer selection is generally the same with one or two seasonal beers Most brewpubs will do more tinkering but I suppose that Triumph has perfected their standbys The food is fine though I certainly wouldn t come here just to eat Also it can be hard to have a meal in the bar area as the tables are a bit cramped 
DTDVtrHVQ5km2fBP13NVIQ CMU Elements opened in Princeton a few months ago and ever since then I have wanted to check it out After 1 cancelled reservation a few weeks ago thanks to my wife we finally went yesterday night We got to the restaurant right on time however there wasn t any parking available and no valet parking either We ended up parking in the lot of a bank about a block away even that only had 2 parking spots left It was a freezing night and only got worse by the end of dinner Boy was I shivering when I got back into the car We walk into the restaurant and find the hostess stand just next to an amazingly small bar I think it could only hold about 3 guests Things seemed a little chaotic Our hostess wasn t there and than 3 different people asked if we were being helped I think one of them was the hostess We got to our table which had no cutlery whatsoever just napkins But this is planned they bring out a fresh set with every course We were approached with the drinks menu by someone who I thought was our waiter but he wasn t A waitress came to take our drink orders she was our waitress I think chaotic service is good word for Elements They have a lot of staff floating around all in an attempt to provide good service but it comes across as chaotic Every course was delivered by a different person usually the same person delivers all your food at most restaurants Despite the chaos it doesn t detract from the food whatsoever which is very good The restaurant itself is pretty nicely decorated in muted earth tones However the lighting is a little on the low side I personally would have liked to have had a little more light to admire the unsmiling attractive waitress who seemed to be jetting back and forth in front of our table all night long Ok it s all about the food and the food save the desserts is very good For the 1st course we had the handmade farfalle which came with broccoli rabe sausage and rock shrimp This was an excellent dish Very flavorful very well balanced and the sausage was amazing I had the pork belly Pork belly is my new favorite thing I was in Dallas last week and had the most amazing pork belly ever from The French Room at The Adolphus This has become the pork belly standard The pork belly at Elements was very good just not as good as The French Room My guess is that if I had not eaten that version I would have liked this even more For the main course we had the black bass in thai curry This was a very good dish too The fish was perfectly cooked and the spices and flavors were perfectly balanced just a little short on salt I had the 48 hour short rib which in a word was fabulous I love short rib and this is the very best version I have ever had It reminded me of an excellent kobe steak perfectly cooked just the right amount of fat amazingly tender beautifully flavored This is a dish to die for For dessert we had the jelly doughnut and chocolate with salty caramel Desserts are ok nothing really to rave about The doughnut itself was very good the jelly was just too tart The chocolate made me think of a brownie not the brioche it was supposed to be and a little salty for me I am very sensitive to salt in food For drinks we had the dirty lychee martini and I had a glass of temparillo which was excellent I wish the wines by the glass list was a little longer Overall great food a very welcome addition to the Princeton restaurant scene which really needs better restaurants I have moaned about the lack of decent restuarants in Princeton foreever it s a crime but things are slowly changing Having a restaurant like Elements will hopefully force other restaurants to push the the creativelity and taste envelope www foodielifestyle com 
dthcy2rvkkYevGnd998ZNA CMU Went for the 1st time today I think you nice folks giving this place 2 stars or less either don t have taste buds or consider the cost of McDonald s a huge night out I had the romaine caeser salad and the fish tacos Both were above average The fish tacos themselves were great The rice and beans that came with it were bland Bland dropped this to a 3 star from a 4 1 star No 2 stars Debatable but no Service was very good Ambiance was solid I ll be back and will probably question the taste buds of the 2 star folks again 
DuPJAOzbcHwg0Ixe97ykzg CMU Excellent seafood Prices are better than other Princeton restaurants not because they are cheaper but because the quality of food and taste is worth it compared to others Ahi tuna is always prefect The crab margarita is to die for fresh lumps of crab meat spices avocado served in a margarita glass not a drink The creme brulee is an award winner The atmosphere is kind of uptight The dining area is very dark There is no outside seating 
dWeJEZNimsjvfyRRrcsXcA CMU I wasn t going to bother writing this place up since I m rarely in Princeton NJ but felt my experience should be known The place itself is a huge cavern vaulted ceiling with a nod to the western style lodges in National Parks and Rocky Mountain enclaves It definitely feels impressive when you first walk in past the semi outdoor fireplace We immediately got a table in the main dining room on a Saturday night but our conversation was brief between the rocking band playing soul and R B covers for the bar crowd at a decibel non conducive to casual dining The place was pricey but to be expected if you re serving really tasty food I wasn t super hungry and opted for the wild mushroom burger 12 so I could get a lobster bisque soup 8 and still be in a reasonable price zone Many appetizers were at 15 The recommended double cut pork chop entree was 25 and steaks were hovering around 34 I also was not drinking so I can t comment on alcohol prices Most of the wine selection was from the California corporate vineyards like Ravenswood or Mondavi etc The table ordered a calamari appetizer which was ok but the breading was falling off and a little underdone in the deep fryer My bisque arrived and it was fishy tasting Not delicious lobster fishy tasting A little overwhelming fishy tasting and I kind of knew what we were getting into then My burger arrived and it was cooked correctly but it was dry and not juicy It kind of fell apart in squares around the edges The potato roll bun was a bit hard and glazed but not in a crusty way And there really wasn t any mushrooms It was mostly these oil soggy caramelized onions on the topping and the tomatoes were super hard In short it was really really expensive diner food And I ve been to diners that do it better for a third of the price And I feel bad saying that because the space itself was pretty cool in that modern lodge kind of way I wasn t expecting the greatest food ever but I was expecting a tasty burger I guess if you re charging these prices you would expect something better than food service style cafeteria quality and something locally purveyed But then I found out it s a chain So there you go Others at the table were pleased with the fish sole and the pork chop While the steak sandwich and two burgers were squarely dismissed The rating is really food based The service was fine and I m sure it s an okay place for a drink but I can t look past my dreadful meal for that price The service and environment get a star 
DzOxeokuf0__4FqEy4PCbw CMU The place itself was pretty cool Well decorated and well comfortable Our server was extremely nice as well I ve been wanting to try this place for a few months Given the interior of the place I was looking forward to good food But sadly the food was bland and tasteless We ordered the risotto cakes for starters and they were too oily the rice was under cooked and needed seasoning The chicken sandwich I got for the meal was bland and tasted stale It had a raw meat smell to it which was a big turn off But we got a beer sampler which was fantastic we got to try all the beers and that was the saving grace of the meal If I was to go back here i d probably only return for the drinks Definitely not the food 
E1RFV6yZ431hgm_pc2DTAQ CMU This is the place I go to for good happy hour The wine list is good and the ambiance is amazing The food I do not like I ve never had anything here that has blown me away or that I thought was worth the prices they charge Drinks yes Food no 
E3Skl6-OmBswciFBJPpGBg CMU My GF got a living social coupon for this place so we gave it a shot last saturday The interior was pretty cool They have regular tables but we sat at a corner table which I kinda like It was pretty comfy seating too Our server was really friendly and came to check on us often The best thing she did was when she read us the specials not listed on the menu she included the prices I wish more servers would do that so you re not surprised when one of your entrees is 45 bucks Anyways we ordered the curry fried oysters to start and I was really impressed I usually enjoy oysters raw but these were cooked just right They were breaded with a curry batter which was really tasty and crispy and topped with salmon roe which gave it a great complimentary burst of flavor The presentation was pretty simple and elegant I was in the mood for sushi so I got the something roll i forgot but it had eel and tempura shrimp with avocado on the outside 14 I also had an alaska roll and sea urchin sushi 6 and 7 respectively I was disappointed when the rolls came cause the special roll was the same size as the alaska roll Typically the special rolls are bigger and packed with more ingredients right The avocado was over ripen and there were tiny pieces of eel in the special roll If I were judging my entree alone I d give the place a 2 I can t do that cause my gf s crabcakes were pretty awesome It came with a really nice shrimp risotto The crab cakes had very little fillers but still held together pretty well The check came out to be 25 bucks after using a 50 dollar coupon Would I come back Sure if I come across another groupon or living social deal I give this place a 3 5 and round up just because the service was great and the space and presentation was great I just wouldn t get sushi rolls again 
eBOQnb-poqAELPTTXormdA CMU Wow service was horrible Got seated at 330 and our waitress took 15 minutes to even come to our table When she FINALLY arrived we ordered a sampler of beers They were out of one but we were never prompted to have a substitute We then ordered a couple of appetizers when she then preceded to tell us that we were sitting at a dinner table like we picked our table We were sat there by the host and pretty much taking up her table for dinner making us feel rushed and as if we were a burden on her and ruined our time there Beer and food were delicious Unfortunate about the service or lack thereof J 
ebvZSy-diO9zn9pHTseLmw CMU great place to come for beer and bar food i have never had anything i didn t like 
EDvqNMEMvrgYCCmP60wl7Q CMU GREAT PLACE Fantastic food Gruyere Panini for me please Even better service And I am a huge fan of their beers Evan is always changing out their brews for new flavors Great seasonals My favorite spots in the Princeton area 
eDyk-d49hMc8kEEjB6NVkQ CMU Let me start by qualifying my rating this probably deserves a score more along the lines of a 4 5 but considering it is in Princeton a town utterly devoid of gastronomic excellence and I am feeling generous I ll round it up to a 5 It is apparent as soon as one walks in the door that Elements is trying to compete with the top restaurants in NYC where most Princeton residents go for a special meal Sleek and modern in design Elements is both eye catching and comfortable Tables in the main dining room are comfortably spaced apart and it never got particularly loud even when the room was full Two trips to Elements once in December and once last week mid February confirmed for me that this is a very fine restaurant indeed On the first occasion I ordered the prix fixe menu and the second time around I ordered off the a la carte menu On both occasions the menus were interesting and I honestly had a difficult time deciding what to order One dish that particularly stood out on both visits was the 48 hour sous vide short ribs Each time the individual at my table who ordered it crowed with delight upon their first bite Eventually everyone got a taste and it was unanimously described as superb On both trips I ordered a cold fish appetizer a seafood medley with scallops shrimp squid and mussels and a scallop ceviche with capers and kumquats These were perfectly prepared Their meat dishes are quite good too When I ordered the prix fixe menu the first time I got a Filet Mignon dish that was good but honestly if you want to eat great steak go to a NY steak house Their roast breast pheasant was delicious however My advice be adventurous Their chicken and beef dishes are fine but if you go off the beaten path you will be rewarded I honestly can t remember my desert dish from the December trip so I guess it wasn t very memorable not great but not bad either Their cheese tray nonetheless is very good My one issue with Elements on the first trip was the service It took nearly 20 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them when we sat down That was the most egregious example of bad service but there were a few lesser examples The second time around fortunately things went much more smoothly Some might object to Element s relatively high prices but one has to put them in context You are paying for what is easily the best meal to be found in town and one that competes with many of New York s better restaurants If I had to choose between a top restaurant in New York Per Se Daniel etc and Elements I would obviously choose the former But the decision would be complicated if we are talking about the 2nd tier of New York restaurants Blue Hill Union Square Caf come to mind Between the trip into city and New York s even higher prices Elements looks very appealing So in summation I would say go if you get an opportunity I doubt you will be disappointed if you are disappointed go try Princeton s other haute cuisine eateries for example Lahiere s I have a feeling you will come around to appreciate Elements 
eGkP1-Iah7G_t5a4qjKQ_Q CMU Excellent food Great service will definitely return 
EKp5tmQr3p6S0dSd17_QIQ CMU Sadly excellent burgers topped with bacon and fried egg along with a great selection of beers are canceled out by the seriously understaffed dining room We ve given up on grabbing a burger and beer here with a group of friends as on our two most recent visits there s been one waiter to cover the entire tavern and formal dining rooms The formal dining room is a Victorian lovers dream and for the rest of us who live in the 21st century it reminds us of dining at granny s 
eMXF7wxXxpcUcaRZlWMkAQ CMU I went with some friends this past Tuesday and all 6 of us did the chef s tasting First I should preface by saying that we had a gift certificate for the tasting I am a BIG fan of tasting menus but there are very few occasions that would have me dropping 100 per person on a dinner that didn t include booze That being said we ate at a big cozy table right off the kitchen which was very cool We got to see everything that was going on The wine menu is huge and we were able to find several very nice bottles for decent prices just try not to think about how the same bottle would cost you 12 99 at the state store The beer list was pretty impressive too considering that places like this don t usually take the time on a beer list when most of their customers are drinking liquor and wine The tasting took about 3 hours and it was PHENOMENAL Everything was amazing and delicious from the bread to the last bite of dessert I might add that our server actually refilled our bread bowl Several times Without being asked SCORE It was explained to us that the chef uses the tasting menu to highlight whatever is fresh and in season And the sous chef came out with each dish to explain it We learned about several new edible plants that we can grow in our own garden and about how the restaurant sources chantarelle mushrooms from a crazy mushroom guy I ve read about hunting for chantarelles You have to be pretty crazy to do it But I digress Honestly everything was delicious It was a true dining experience food wine and atmosphere included We all had a wonderful time and truly enjoyed the experience I have no idea when or if we ll be back its a bit of a hike and the prices really warrant a truly special occasion for me at least 
eo1AJNFGhgJ8IjVRahuo6Q CMU We will not go back Food was over priced and under seasoned Wasabi mashed potatoes were tasteless and scallops were under seasoned and not seared properly On the other hand the wait staff were very attentive and accommodating However when checking our bill we found several discrepancies Check your bill carefully 
EpZFOjdYf83NTqqpvAZooQ CMU Shame on me for thinking NJ didn t have comparable restaurants to NYC ONE 53 is my saving grace and I now want to explore numerous other restaurants in NJ my home state my birth state my ONLY state hm I take that last part back Located a short ways away from Princeton another town with great restaurants and an Ivy league school this little diamond in the rough shines on a fairly stale residential road It s easy to miss because it blends in with the houses surrounding it so keep your eyes peeled We made reservations and were promptly seated upon our arrival The host was pleasant the restaurant had a modern contemporary feel to it and the bar was fully stocked ready to lubricate it s thirsty visitors After sitting down and getting settled I almost forgot where I was NJ or NYC Down to the important stuff FOOD Appetizer Escargot The snails were REALLY plump and served over a thin piece of pastry The flavors were present but not well enough to round out the dish I wouldn t order this again I overheard the waiter next to us praising the foie gras and I regret not going with my gut and ordering it Grr French Fries with Truffle Mayo Heavenly You MUST get this The truffle oil was oozing from the mayo and with every fry I dipped into the sauce my mouth sang and my heart smiled Entree Oktoberfest Plate This is a seasonal dish and came with 3 weiners 1 Frankfurt 2 Broiled Bratwurst 3 Grilled Bratwurst I enjoyed the Broiled Bratwurst the most but the German lady next to me who ordered the same plate said the Frankfurt is actually the more popular weiner Overall the plate was everything I expected no more no less Pan Seared Scallops with Lentils and Mustard Vinaigrette The scallops were cooked perfectly and the presentation looked flawless Usually when something looks good it tastes good and this definitely fell into this category Unfortunately I didn t get to taste as much as I would ve liked but my friend said it was good Dessert Chocolate Bread Pudding with Caramel Bourbon Sauce WOWZA that was a mouthful to say and eat A lot of the reviews kept mentioning this dessert and I have to say it was good The bread wasn t as moist as I imagined it to be but it wasn t too sweet and paired well with my beer Jackpot Reasons to come back 1 Seared Foie Gras 2 Braised Short Rib 3 Mussels in White Wine Broth with Chorizo 4 Rossini Burger Kobe Beef Foie Gras Truffle Cheese Madeira marinated Mushrooms Truffle Mayo on Onion Brioche 5 Ice Cream or Sorbet from the bent spoon Awesome Ice Cream Shop and Bakery in Princeton Anyone want to take a trip with me I ll drive 
er6vpQUKLslnxKXT_01eWQ CMU The food s good the beer is ok The service and attitude of the waitstaff need improvement 
eRD6j_ti0kQub75yrbSL_A CMU I like some chain restaurants but it s been hit or miss for me at this location I had really good pot roast during one lunch but mediocre meals other times I guess being a scratch kitchen means consistency can vary My chicken noodle soup had too much pepper for my kids shouldn t the customer be allowed to add salt and pepper to taste Yet my kids like the ambience so perhaps I ll just stick with the pot roast if I go back It does seem to be a popular place 
ErutckNPS1RiKyMC91Px7w CMU bobby trigg continues to deliver some of the best food in the area easily the best dining experience in princeton if he could just do it a little more reasonably as soon as i hit the powerball i m going back great food no kidding 
eSNsKirzCl4zxrltHY85aA CMU I ve lived worked gone to school in and around Princeton since 1993 and am here on yelp to help dispell the myth that there s nowhere to eat or drink in this part of the world Quite the contrary Obviously one person s opinion is no more worthwhile than anyone else s but I feel that I m pretty objective and appropriately critical Dinner at one53 starts with bread and a white bean and garlic puree in lieu of butter It s a nice touch and will absolutely fill you up Tread lightly The wine list for a neighborhood bistro is larger and pricier than expected There are always about a dozen wines by the glass and piccolo carafe about 1 75 glasses worth Cocktails are substantial and appropriately expensive A gin on the rocks is the equivalent of a bit more than a double at most bars Beer snobs take note you can get Chimay in the bottle here Had a salad of pancetta bleu cheese and pears the last time I was there which was great In fact me and my wife had made meals of their apps and sides on more than one occasion Their pastas handmade at Lucy s are excellent and their burger is substantial and honestly a bit too much I mean that in a good way I had the lamb shank special there last week and it was appropriately falling off the bone tender My wife had the scallops didn t notice what else as I was attempting to get through the shank She liked them The most common criticism of the food is that it s bland underseasoned I can see that though I don t necessarily agree In my experience the food has been cooked to order Better not quite salty enough than too salty I m ashamed to admit that I haven t made it too dessert the last couple times we ve eaten there though you do get ginger chocolate cookies with your bill that are quite good Service has wavered between average and very very good I agree with the folks who ve said you don t quite feel like you get what you pay for here For example shared app 2 entrees no dessert 1 cocktail 1 glass of wine ended up just north of 120 with tip For us that s less a neighborhood quick dinner and more of a special occasion spot 
esTKXrnRrA7K0PmVUF5xYA CMU For being in a seemingly semi upscale shopping plaza this is quite possibly the most ghetto Arby s I ve ever been to and I worked in Jamaica Queens for a while The sandwiches taste good but sent me running for the bathroom when I got home and I ve never had that reaction from an Arby s before Avoid this place like the plague 
euP959CSEyV0BvWhqtRkNQ CMU SO and I have returned to visit several times as it is so close Each time has been ok but okay enough to warrant the removal of one star This is all based on food the service and ambiance is definitely still inviting One time I went there and ordered the steak salad thinking it would be enough to kind of tide me over for the night I had eaten a late lunch but SO was hungry He got the sliders which is listed under the sandwiches but doesn t include fries because it s actually an appetizer whatever When I was greeted with my steak salad I almost wanted to laugh There were 4 5 very thin very limp looking pieces of steak on a bed of romaine iceberg lettuce How disappointing Especially since this salad was 14 bucks It also said it would come with blue cheese crumbles which is didn t so I had to ask the bartender to ask the kitchen for a side of some The last time was a littl ebetter since we were just getting bar apps The calamari was good not my favorite but I liked the different dipping sauce We also got wings which were ample enough and spicy though very saucy Each dining time has been so so the quality of food doesn t match up with the prices but I will probably still go there because of their great beer selection Their cocktails are still very too expensive for me to try there s an amazing sounding one with champagne and St Germain so beer it is There is always room at the bar where we prefer to eat Tip your best bet is to get the Rocky Hill Burger which you can get sans the fried egg IT is 13 dollars and ample and filling 
EWRH8xAL9zIEW9dvYzgRqg CMU staff super friendly food and atmosphere awesome 
EX-uz8QP21vE5aPPN8Zebw CMU The Salt Creek Grille appears to be a fancy shmancy establishment since it is in Princeton NJ and when you walk in you see a fireplace and beautiful decor Almost like a lodge And the food is outstanding especially their garlic shoe string fries The service is good but not overbearing However you don t end up being gauged when your bill comes 
Ex9gWe-RUSJxtKhwVj2A8A CMU I d say this is really a 3 5 Some of the food is amazing really just incredible And other dishes are pretty meh Wife and I have been twice and for both times the wait for cocktails is unusually long The wine and sake pairings are very well done but the house cocktails I ve tasted so far are downright awful Last night I tried the Oktober with bourbon and all spice and I swear on a stack of menus it smelled and I assume tastes like Absorbine Jr Our apps were fantastic the tortellini and toro sashimi and I love that the sake was cold not cold enough for me tho and poured into a wine glass The black cod was good but not great and the 48 hour short ribs were meaty but not really tender and had no sauce Potato puffs on the plate were excellent though The kit kat dessert was divine but last night s cheese platter left a lot to be desired and it takes a lot for me not to want to eat any cheese The blue wasn t tart enough and the other two choices were bland or bitter However we unknowingly went on a 20 Princeton Restaurant Week special so the bill came to 180 without gratuity For a bill a bit over 200 the meal could have been a bit better Still I appreciate the local ingredients and wine knowledge 
exVnypWVGWXfoVJpkaDVEw CMU Love the beer esp the Ipx Ambience is very cool city feel Food homemade and good flavors Just always crowded 
f1780OzoOIY_lkPW3xGomA CMU Awesome food and beer Great service and always enjoy taking friends here Such variety of beers WANT MORE 
F2qkDOaU258m2jswIOXs9w CMU I don t know what the rave about this place is but I originally came here after work at 8pm on a Friday night for a few drinks with some coworkers I started the night off with two of their beers the Scottish Ale and the Amber Ale at the bar and neither of them were to my tasting They just had too much hops in it for me At 5 50 glass I felt it was only a light loss and only drank half of both of them before I discarded it back to the bartender Then we got hungry and decided to get some food We had to walk back to the front hostess to grab a little beeper and was told to wait 20 minutes After 10 minutes we decided we were too hungry and just got a plate of calamari to start Good thing too because we weren t seated until another 20 minutes after that They say that after a few drinks and when you re really hungry everything tastes better That was not the case for the calamari The breading didn t stick to the calamari and the squid was just bland After being seated we ordered some more appetizers duck croquettes fried pickles and tuna tartare The Tune Tartare had a spice to it but the tuna itself was tasteless too Fried pickles were good and quite a treat and the duck croquettes seemed to lack the taste of duck Overall I wouldn t go back for the food but maybe for the beer once they rotate the tap 
f2SgtrmOLDroMMO9ilB6zg CMU Finally got a chance to come here and had a fun night The place was packed when we first got here but we grabbed a couple beers at the bar and then swooped in on a table before anyone else could get to it Between the four of us I tried just about every beer they had on their board The ones that really stood out for me were the Chocolate Stoudt mmmm Pumpkin Ale and the IPA can t remember what it was called but it was the only IPA on the board Also I m not a big IPA guy but this was good By the time we were done my palate was satisfied and I was feeling goooood Mission accomplished 
f5oU5rWXCl9ama91_P5uzg CMU The menu offers a good array of standard choices The food is very well prepared The decor is well designed and given the size of the crowd keeps the din manageable The staff is very professional and friendly It s not fine dining but it s a reliable option 
fAgzSYweUx0fX4307DYCyA CMU This is where I wish that you could give a variety of ratings for service food etc In general I think that the beer obviously and the food are quite good here and are decent for the price esp the sandwiches burgers We always get the calamari which we think is the best in town However the service is curt bordering on snobby especially the host hostess at the front of the restaurant It always feels like we re too important to help you right now you figure out your own situation because obviously we have better things to do like standing here and discouraging potential guests Unless you have a reservation here or come in the lunch afternoon time it s over crowded and exceptionally noisy Bars are supposed to be chill and relaxing but I always feel harried and stressed out I hate having to raise my voice to be heard across the table I also don t like the cover charge that is mandatory when they have a band Usually the band is mediocre and good god who needs even MORE noise in this place I ve been to the Triumph in New Hope which was much much nicer 
faL018xTqVhPPBv8QQACmg CMU This is not a college hangout by any stretch since the prices are more in line with the uncle who made a killing on Wall Street in the 80 s only to be sentenced to 10 to 20 in Sing Sing for embezzlement But you were his favorite nephew so he took you here to show off his 24 karat gold cuff links Oh yes this is old school dining except for the fact that the young waiter kept texting between courses He was understandably bored since I was only one of three diners in the entire restaurant that evening Tony places like this make me self conscious but the food was pretty good all things considered I was rather self indulgent given I was on an expense account for the meal and I only had a bag of stale potato chips for lunch I ordered a rather hefty appetizer the 13 Warm Duck Salad with Mandarin Oranges Pecans Orange Tarragon Vinaigrette and a Balsamic Reduction see photo It was a delicious confit with a lot of sweet elements but not enough to offset the savoriness of the duck The peppery arugula and julienned carrots were a nice enough accompaniment to consider this really an entree Despite the additional temptation of a series of mushroom dominated appetizers I moved forward with my entree the 31 Grilled NY Strip Steak with Wild Mushrooms Sega Blue Cheese Mashed Potato and a Cabernet Reduction see photo I was happy I got some of their trademark mushrooms and the sliced beef was tender and juicy My one minor complaint was that the reduction amounted to a pool of sauce that diluted the consistency of the potatoes The two courses were plenty enough for me that evening Dessert was out of the question at least until I got out of the restaurant FOOD 4 stars old style dining well turned and elegantly presented AMBIANCE 3 5 stars clubby like you should whisper SERVICE 3 stars attentive enough between texts TOTAL 4 stars for the duck and the shrooms 
feecPP_KiVDC8B92eBW7FQ CMU My husband and I have been to the New hope location which we like a bit better The menu was great here I had the flat bread in the appz and the calamari highly recommend both of them My husband got the lamb sandwich and some soup of the day which he said was okay small portions on the lamb mostly bread But he loved my food ha Our waitress stunk She was incredibly slow and unknowledgeable about the menu The atmosphere is always great beers are freaking awesome price is right for what you get give it a try and make sure to get the flat bread 
FEO3PXyNy2gsfN0ww0X-1Q CMU Elements was a wonderful experience Portions are not huge but it seems Americans are very used to super sized portions I was more than satisfied with my dinner that evening It was a group of 6 people on a Saturday evening The place was packed However the service was very good throughout the meal sometimes the wait staff brought an incorrect portion to a customer and the waiter forgot my wine however I was not charged for it on the final check which was nice of him The prices are high almost no entr e was less than 30 Appetizers are over 10 and the desserts started at 8 Dinner for the 6 of us they put an 18 service charge in was nearly 600 Cocktails were excellent The bartender a young man from VA whose name I forget was a delight and assisted in helping me make my selection He is very professional as is all of the staff and many of the cocktails are his own creation Make sure you check them out Appetizers were good several of us had soup Mine was an apple soup with a pate in it Others had split pea and they liked it Presentation was very well done Entrees were all very good we had items ranging from Venison I had that which was sublime Pork Rib Eye and 48 hour ribs which was adored There are a few unique ingredients on the menu and the waiter was more than happy to explain The staff is friendly not at all condescending have seen too many snotty waiters who look at me like I m from another planet when I don t recognize an ingredient One caveat they could say how much a special is rather than surprising the customer Desserts were wonderful from apple cobbler with chartreuse ice cream to homemade ice creams and cheesecake When we were leaving the entire staff helped us all put on our coats I m not from Princeton but if I go back there to visit my friends I ll definitely go back 
FFTq43yIS9durgJGXy1nTw CMU While the beer here is quite good the food service and value is more to be desired Typical place that fails at all of the small details Ordered appetizers and dinner not sure why the dinner came out only 5 minutes after the appetizers Yum yum I love eating cold Roast Beef sandwich with cheese GF ordered the Pumpkin pasta and it came with char coaled cherries I tried one and nearly gagged Waitress brought out dried untoasted cherries as a replacement not counting that the burnt cherries on the pasta also make the pasta taste like burnt cherries This dish was 16 btw for 8 pieces yes that is about 2 per piece of pasta Unbelievable I had the roast beef pita sandwich and the meat was of low quality One half of the sandwich had a piece of beef with a big vein and completely not eatable Also the sandwich was very dry with no dipping sauce Finally dont let the menu description fool you apparently caramelized onions means raw onions as I found out Waitress asked if we wanted desert we said no and she brought out the check At this point we were drinking pints What waitress brings a check when you still have 1 2 pint left She didnt even ask if we wanted more to drink just brought the check because we didnt want desert Id rather pay 5 a pint here for beer than eat a desert that I would guess is subpar given our dinner experience Condiments what restaurant charges 10 for burgers and makes their own beer and give Grey Poupon as a mustard Surely you can afford to give something better with some actual taste Amount of food I had an appetizer and dinner item totaling 20 and she had the same totaling nearly 27 Total check was 70 and we barely had a buzz and where still hungry This is completely unacceptable at a brewpub Maybe if I were eating salmon and fillet mignon it would be OK but in this case yeah no value here Summary eat elsewhere this place gets 2 stars simply for its beer No other reason Just come get growlers and get the hell out 
FjXMlSXyqPfU2FiQOt0Cgw CMU The Salt Creek Grill will be hard for me to rate because of the extenuating factor that a bunch of people had breakfast hear with my cousin and cousin in law the day after they were married First the complaints They could not accommodate seating for twenty people who were there at opening I can kinda understand this but when I went to the restroom I saw several private rooms that could be set up for 20 people that were not occupied when we arrived or left I guess they could have been reserved for just after we departed Second they apparently burned all of the bacon they had in the restaurant Instead of two side orders of bacon we got one side order of bacon and one of sausage My question is how a restaurant could run out of bacon I didn t look at the dinner menu but wonder if they have a bacon cheeseburger Now the positive When the bacon was burnt they provided an alternative without asking Maybe we would have refused the sausage which as a sausage l would never do Bu just bringing something is a plus They had no problem dealing with toddlers The food was pretty tasty My wife and I split the Salt Creek Bakery Basket which was huge We actually had to pass the fruits and pastries around the table so that we could finish them all We failed in the attempt One of the said pastries was a strawberry danish Not something you find every day Finally when they ran out of bacon accidentally put cheese on my brother s pork roll sandwich when he had ordered it without cheese and took forever the manager comped our meal FOR FIVE PEOPLE Not only was that nice but then he asked if we wanted anything else Yes he was going to add to a bill he was already swallowing Jokingly I asked for a glass of champagne and he responded Just for you or for everyone Yes he was willing to let us add alcohol to a bill he was already comping If I ever happen to be in Princeton again I will eat here just because of the service I do see a number of negative reviews here I hope that the staff has taken the to heart and today everyone has as good an experience as I did 
fkaHdMKAy0gvgWjOaWhwOw CMU The most impressive part of our experience was our waitress She was obviously impeccably trained and very attentive My steak was cooked just right and it wasn t too big of a portion We also had the cheesecake and it was wonderful 
FKI663QhQIqkrmoo-4hIzg CMU We ve been dining at One 53 since the week they opened their doors It s continues to be our local favorite We especially enjoy dining at the bar The menu changes frequently and keeps us coming back In 4 years of dining here once a month or more we can t remember any meals that have let us down Current favs include the lobster risotto the flounder and the best mussels in the state of NJ 
FLGCS2vA0NCzofWURXunPA CMU Dinner Bar Review Came here on a coworker s recommendation Located right next to Panera Bread on Nassau Small storefront with two Triumph banners flags in the front I missed it the first time past the street Ordered Steamed Littleneck clams in a honey wheat broth Hanger Steak sandwich lettuce tomato onion pickle house fries Refreshments House Irish stout and the Scottish Ale The littlenecks were Tasty I almost drank the broth it came in but refrained because I figured it was probably butter based but I thought about it The hanger steak sandwich was tasty the bartender asked me if there was something wrong with it because I was looking at it funny I said no but what I was really thinking was Where s the meat It was tasty but for the size of the roll I was hoping for a higher meat roll ratio The beers were good The stout wasn t as tasty as The Stout Standard and I ve never had scottish ale before which is served at a certain temperature that I don t remember but it does come out of a separate tap so I can t really compare the ale to anything else Can t really tell how the atmosphere of the place was since I sat at the bar the whole time But it is a size able place that you definitely wouldn t expect with the 10x10 storefront I d come back if I ever stay in Princeton again Oh price was reasonable 9 12 I think for both the clams and the sandwich Beer was reasonable too 
FlGjCZ3GBlg_S9OHu95_Dw CMU The place had a great location right in Princeton but after having been to the Triumph in New Hope it just doesn t compare The outside seating at New Hope was awesome as well as the food For some reason the burger just didn t taste the same The beer and the staff were great in both places though so if I d definitely recommend it for a drink If you re going to eat I say go to Triumph Brewery in New Hope 
fljF7mJWweMNo9hmLMdP7g CMU Stop in here for a good beer But go someplace else for food The service and beer at the bar were great However once we sat down for dinner it was all downhill Some specifics There were at least 5 items from the menu which were not available and the waiter didn t mention this until we ordered he even told one of the four people in our group that they were out of his dish while he was serving the rest of us The grilled chicken club was missing the guacamole and was served with chewy homemade potato chips ugh The Nonna s rigatoni with sausage meatball and homemade gravy didn t have any meatball though lots of sausage Drink service was very slow The lettuce in the house salad wasn t washed well lots of gritty sand dirt With all the great places in Princeton there are many better options for dinner 
Fpa5SrHGN6SZ8YD3zAzmHw CMU this place defines princeton small homely cozy right in the heart of witherspoon great calamari app main dishes all consistently good ok nothing great many memories here 
Fs4sAk8X94Brj1PlR5EvSw CMU Been here a few times for both lunch and dinner The place seems always packed We had to gather round tables by the bar because there were no tables available This place is known for its own special brewed beers Since I rarely drink beer and when I do I stick to the Samuel Adams and Molsens so any special brew to me tasted medicinee Shared crab tater tots and chicken lollipops upper part of a chicken wing appetizers The sweet and sour Thai chili sauce went well with the plump and crispy chicken rounds I had the duck breast with roasted squash and beets The portion was small compared with the meat sandwiches my colleagues ordered but was tasty 
fvmCk-4FFU7NqDvNPMB95A CMU Its better than 3 stars not quite 4 Most def better than your average microbrewery most of them suck The place is huge and has a really great energy to it which is totally unexpected from its tiny unassuming entryway The beers are actually pretty good although i wish they also offered regular beer for those who dont do the microbrew thing And the food Its really good We loved everything we had including the superlong stringbeans And as the night went on the live music went on and we just never wanted to leave Good fun good for large groups or small If it gets too crowded there is tons of room upstairs I d go back 
FXBE67ASKD1EN-3TN1pVVA CMU It was not easy to find this place tucked in next to a Shell station and it doesn t scream great restaurant here at you either It looks more like the kind of place where you could get a filling done or a tooth pulled from the outside anyway Inside is pleasant nice decor not packed at lunch either The wait staff was very good timely and pleasant They were trying to stretch their creativity with the food but at the end of the day it has to taste good I don t honestly give a crap if it has a dish made a flour from some weird plant I want delicious flavor The field greens salad had very little actual salad a few pansies devoid of flavor and lumps of some kind of melted off flavored cheese Yuk I had the pasta dish cavatelli the pasta was cooked properly but had shavings of unpleasant tasting vegetables bitter and off putting And there wasn t much And I was hungry damn it Nice coffee afterwards and they gave us a little cake on the way out nice touch I didn t have to pick up the tab since a colleague graciously did so I wouldn t pay out of my pocket for this personally And I ate a protein bar on the way home 
FyGNonrTNHU0EFKSQrjQ3A CMU I had my anniversary dinner here in May Although i must say having recently moved here from NYC this place is decent i cant say id go back there again The service was sorta nice but a bit slow and the food was just OK The price however is on the moderately high side so i expected a lil better the atmosphere is decent although a bit crowded due to its popularity The dessert chocolate bread pudding however was pretty good but from what i hear there are more options for good dessert in the area 
f_tYk20Wa-a6QXMzl7FKQQ CMU Nice ambiance the bar definitely has a cocktail lounge feel to it low lighting and upscale decor and all that Went with a living social coupon and it was no problem our waitress handled it well and also did a good job as a server in general and it definitely helped defray the costs of the somewhat pricey menu Had edamame 2 of the special sushi rolls and some of my boyfriend s New York strip steak which were all very good I d come back if I were going to be in that area anyway but probably wouldn t make a special trip I think you can get sushi that s just as good or better at some of the Japanese restaurants in the area without the high cost of going to Pure 
g-MAiMv5Wg7xnscuf3HzFA CMU My favorite restaurant in NJ I eat here 2 3 times per month and have never had a bad meal A great staff who know what they are doing can actually describe a menu item and not just tell you that it is good Sitting at the bar is always a fun place you are bound to talk to the people around you and leave in a better mood than you came in thanks in part to the bartender Craig Always looking forward to my next visit 
g3sgv748z1QvSyOIHci26A CMU Good burgers and beers I drank the Winter Wonder and it kicked my ass it really snuck up on me I describe their lunch menu as eclectic pub food all very good Fine for families with kids during the day at night I imagine you see more of the corporate and hoity toity set There s also live music regularly The waitresses are attentive and friendly The space is large with a lot of exposed brick and artwork that can be purchased 
GBQN5vKdL7Bz3Hd59VrR6A CMU Food is rather acceptable But get ready for waiters refilling your water glass nonstop it seems that it is the only thing they truly care about as they charged 7 bucks per bottle last time I was there Also ambiance is good if you are a senior citizen Otherwise there is a very good chance that you will be the only person under 60 at this establishment 
gG2Djy5zaKHT2kp5ZfeyBQ CMU I ve been to the Princeton area about 5x in the last year and this past week I discovered this newly opened restaurant It s on one of the main roads passing near Princeton and it looks like a residential house I stopped in and atmosphere was definitely inviting with a good group of people at the bar and not too bright lighting I ate at the bar since I was there for business and traveling alone and the friendly female bartenders were nice and attentive The bread they served came with a hummus like spread Tasty 
ghYj0FkS6mXSrnz36sE2Tg CMU This place supports excellent quality live music and the food and drinks are consistently good A great night out if you like good music that is 
GkzSgSpDwInQcp6GzcJodA CMU Dan and I celebrated on 11 year wedding anniversary on June 7 and I decided we should dine at elements in Princeton I had heard good things about elements and wanted to give it a try for myself We had a reservation for the chef s table and were immediately led to our table in the kitchen We weren t in the middle of the cooking but could see everything happening in the open kitchen Since we were going to have the tasting menu we had no idea what we were going to eat Before he took our drink order our waiter asked if we had any food allergies of if there were foods we really didn t want to eat Since we were celebrating I wanted to start the evening with champagne Our server recommended a bottle of Champagne Moutard Grand Cuvee As we waited for our bottle to arrive I pointed out different parts of the restaurant to Dan I had been in the restaurant a couple of weeks before to drop off something and had a tour of the place As you enter the restaurant there is a tiny bar in front There are only about 3 stools so elements is really not the place to go for just a drink Soon after the server poured our first glass of champagne our amuse bouche small bite of food before meal begins arrived My trio of bites included a sweet potato soup with golden raisins and pecans and a fennel sausage frisee I can t remember the third item The sweet potato soup was absolutely delicious It was super creamy and tasted like melted sweet potato pie in a cup Unfortunately this soup is reserved for the amuse bouche and isn t on the regular menu Second course a salad including radish cavatelli quinoa radish pods housemade granola baby radish goat cheese pine nuts pesto and a citrus dressing I don t usually eat radish but this was a nice blend of wonderful tastes This was followed by a herb fed hamachi served with green strawberry macademia nuts sushi rice sesame cilantro ginger frozen yogurt and a radish spring mix I tend to shy away from raw fish but had to give this a try I m so glad I did It was really quite good Click to here to see the blog entry at elements website about this dish http blog elementsprinceton com p 982 The fourth course was probably my least favorite It was a local fluke served with a vegetable mix local carrots and a broth of carrot and ginger This was garnished with black and white sesame seeds I d never had this fish before and am not likely to have it again The fish was a little tasteless but I enjoyed the vegetables and broth Next up we had pan seared monkfish with a bit of pork belly grilled romaine and harisa sauce This was all surrounded by a 64 1 2 egg yolk I d had the grilled romaine before at an event elements did for the Junior League The monkfish and pork belly weren t to my liking but the harisa sauce provided the right amount of spice Sometime between the 5th and 6th course we ordered a second bottle of wine This time we had a Melville 2008 Pinot Noir Sixth course Yes we re still eating This dish consisted of a housemade potato gnocchi chorizo parmesan cheese clams crushed red pepper jalapeno and basil oil with fresh basil Dan is allergic to clams and had his without the clams The chef said the flavors would remind us of a pepperoni pizza If I closed my eyes real tight I could almost imagine I was eating a pepperoni pizza not It was good though Seventh course For this course we had a short rib terrine with a short rib consomm This was accompanied by fennel tossed with blue cheese I liked the consomm but could have done without the terrine I didn t finish Colorado lamb chops and artichoke puree were served for our final savory course My lamb was a little underdone for me and I asked for it to be cooked longer Dan jokingly told me I should have mentioned that when they asked at the beginning of the meal if either of us had any food allergies or foods we didn t want to eat The chop was returned to me medium well I prefer well done but was quite happy with medium well Our transition from savory to sweet was a spectacular egg shell filled with layers of French toast bacon custard and a maple syrup foam There was also a mini slice of French toast and maple syrup on the plate It was sooo good Dan thought this was the best course We thought this was the perfect end to our meal and then a plate of sweets was placed before us All I can remember is the raspberry beer shaved ice Oh my Though we experienced several courses I didn t feel stuffed but definitely satisfied Our meal was VERY expensive 105 per person for the tasting menu wine tip and this certainly isn t a place for everyday dining However it s a great place to go for a special occasion or an evening of pampering Next time I ll listen to the friends who said go for brunch The food is less expensive but just as good 
GqXozkR2wKnNh9lHa2f9ng CMU Terrible service Good beer Bad drinks Amazing food lol 
gROQFBb5CSQYDTGOAr3DKQ CMU This place is amazing a Manhattan quality restaurant in the Princeton area This is my first choice when my parents want to take us out for dinner when we re in Princeton Students beware this place isn t cheap but if it s a special occasion go for it you won t be disappointed I ALWAYS ask the waiter what the best thing on the menu is because every time I go there is always something new I particularly like to order fish here because this is the type of restaurant that takes it s fish seriously and won t screw it up Everything is always cooked very well with good quality ingredients The beer list is also very good with a solid selection of ales and microbrews 
gWbQ647_T05FH06XozLDAg CMU Very good service We had a small wait for our table on a Saturday evening The bread is delicious It s warm and spread with garlic and butter and slightly cheesey The sangria is very tasty although I felt like mine had a bit too much lemon in it My mom ordered the salmon with rice and veggies and she liked it a lot said the fish was cooked perfectly One of my sisters ordered steak rare and she said that was good too My other sister and I got the kobe beef burger and that was really good I m not a big fan of the fries they re too skinny and once they get cold they become rock solid Not very pleasant For dessert we shared an assortment of sorbets The ambience at this restaurant is very comforting There is a big fireplace in the entrance and during warm evenings you can lounge outside in the couch area by the fireplace The overall place is huge and it s great for large groups or parties Prices are reasonable 
gZ6qfVVx_GXiWO44Z05P7w CMU Very nice place Homemade food Always good Great meat 
H-7aXMSi9etgDlRkNTAb7Q CMU I went here for an anniversary dinner and was not unhappy when I left I will say though that for how expensive the restaurant is I was expecting a bit more from my entree especially We chose to split a cold and warm starter and have our own main courses The rib eye tar tar starter was delicious That was by far my favorite part of the meal The shitake mushroom tempura starter was very plain and sub par I wish we had chosen a different warm starter For an entree I went with the fluke and although I did enjoy all of the flavors that were included it was still on the bland side The fluke itself though was cooked very well The presentation of all of the plates was wonderful The cocktails were delicious The atmosphere was a bit cold in my opinion The waiter next to us explained that the building used to be a garage so I can understand why they went with the decor they did but it was a bit stark for my likings An interesting meal overall and I d recommend giving it a try for a special occasion or if you re interesting in trying something a bit more innovative than the norm 
h9bIr2xurvKjjzu1Alm_Tg CMU Had an amazing waiter that guided us through a delicious meal Food and wine are top notch Seating is tight Worth the trip to the middle of nowhere 
hbBFoAU4aEhJb8A_kht8DA CMU I never could decide if I like the Princeton or the New Hope Triumph better Sure the food s a touch on the pricey side and the menu doesn t have much in the way of options but who the hell cares when you can sample seasonal microbrewery beer you ve never before lapped up Honestly when a place looks this rad okay New Hope does win for atmosphere and mixes some of the strongest drinks ever does the food even matter that much It gets an extra star because I m a sucker for a great ambience and a wickedly rad interior And an awful lot of Triumph s microbrewed offerings are or at least they were a year and a half ago delightfully Guinness like which is great when you like a beer that actually has some balls to it This definitely is one of those places where I could be utterly content to simply sit and drink for a few hours I d definitely recommend this place to someone looking for a bar instead of someone looking for a restaurant though 
HCa952pLJgf8mV1lB3mTYw CMU I keep going back here and when I leave I wonder why I think its because their beer is very good and always rotating But you see their bands almost ALWAYS suck I mean really suck and all the beer in the world ok well maybe that much could can t make them suck less So I always leave wanting my 5 cover back Especially because its one of the only places categorized methinks a bit wrongly 
hfMLpzyFRu4py6u-VuTomQ CMU Wife took me here for my birthday and the food service ambiance and vino were all fantastic Highly recommended and look forward to going back 
hhXFpvW420GcJu7J0UX-Yg CMU The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent The prime rib I ordered medium came rare and a little tough However the lump crab and avocado dish was outstanding The wine list is extensive I will return here 
hiV660yy8r2JymBawb8hsA CMU Disclaimer this review is not based on food drink simply the experience that we had Saturday upon entering Triumph We were a party of 5 plus a 6 week old but VERY well behaved baby When we entered the restaurant around 5 30 it was quite busy but understandably so for a Saturday evening We were greeted and then much conversation ensued between the host and the hostess about where to put us The hostess said the host would go upstairs and set our table and they d get us sat right away We packed up the stroller put it away and waited for the host to come back Several minutes later he emerged and said Sorry but it s going to be a half hour to an hour wait I replied But we were told we d be seated now And he literally walked away No reply no nothing The fact that we had just packed up all of the baby s things added insult to injury and we turned around and left I have never experienced such complete disinterest from someone in customer service I will never go back to try this place based entirely on this experience it left a terrible taste in all of our mouths 
HK7bQon_8xpJJxiHe6ozrw CMU Triumph is very good Most importantly the beers are solid Last week I had a great bourbon cask 750ml version of their usual stout and it was extremely tasty Their usual beers might lean a little to the lighter side but they are all very good I know some people aren t a huge fan of their food I ve always had a good experience with their fish tacos and their brie grilled cheese sandwich is nice Most importantly they have a bunch of apps which is great if you just want to hang with some friends and nosh on food The Mediterranean plate is good although you ll have to ask for a second side of pita The service is mixed I had a guy at our table last time who couldn t tell me the difference between the bottle fortified and regular stout and I thought that was a bit junior league He also didn t check in on us much which kind of sucked because we would have had another beer if he did If you re hanging in the bar and you get lucky the tables are nice But standing room is a bit touchy this isn t the kind of place that has a lot of room for people to stand and just hang out That s fine though that s not what it s about The bands that play are usually very good but they CRANK up the volume so be prepared to groove not talk with your friends if you re near the speakers 
HnDjJ4OI07TsCHs67z2vSQ CMU EEEk When a restaurant says is closes at 2 then gives its potential customers an attitude for trying to have a drink at 11 30 either officially change your hours or suck it up and stay open Impure 
hNJ10VsrCubBFcAdXbL6fQ CMU I generally give very generous reviews So if a place gets 1 star from me there s something very very wrong For some reason people who live and or work in the Princeton area seem to think that this place serves up incredible food just because the menu items are pricey And you know what I just smile and nod but I never am the one to actually suggest eating here So SCG gets plenty of chances to get it right in my book But EVERY time I m here the meat is simply overcooked I ve had the pork chop which used to be the best thing on their menu until they started overcooking it to death Likewise with the steaks and burgers Apparently medium rare means cook it grey with a sliver of pink in the middle I want my beef juicy with flavor not dried out thank you I will have to say though that the service is always pretty good and the decor looks quite nice though I see that many people complain about the acoustics of the room That however is not enough to warrant anything above one star in the face of overpriced and overcooked meat 
HovsPwBS6PsShuXui1vV0Q CMU My girlfriend and I tried this place because when I looked up my location on my Yelp iPhone app this was the highest rated High ratings are WELL deserved Let s see PROS As mentioned the herb butter with the bread is awesome We shared the cheese and fruit plate as an appetizer Very good I got the salmon cooked medium rare with Spanish rice avocado salsa and asparagus OMG Amazing This salmon tasted so fresh and was cooked amazingly well My gf tried some and agreed She got the pork tenderloin with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus It also has a mixture of sauces on it This was also extremely good Bathroom was clean There were heaters spread throughout so it was nice and toasty in there We were there for lunch so the prices were very reasonable CONS After we got our entrees they sort of forgot about us One quick check in after our first bites then literally nothing no refills and our plates were completely clean and we had been sitting for about 15 minutes before the server came back All in all great meal We re so glad we trusted Yelp 
hRCB3NORJZ_gSNxHvcsNYg CMU Foodie Friday not a winner And we love eclectic Embarrassed to have brought friends from out of town The Amuse Bouche was delish Cream of turnip soup and curried chicken salad Also enjoyed the dessert cheese course but nothing in between the fish courses were BLAND some fingerling potatoes were crunchy and the meat course short ribs was dry and tough Seriously Had great short ribs recently at Acacia in Lawrenceville love KC Prime Witherspoon Grille in this area also Metro North sorry not Elements 
hT7WFGqMwR0ny1CXCF7aRA CMU I ve been to Elements many times for Brunch and only recently made it there for dinner I tried their 4 course prixe fix menu I typically steer away from a pre set menu because even at 6 years old I didn t like to be told what to eat However what makes the Element s menu nice is the fact that you have options and the portions are just enough you don t feel overstuffed but you re not wondering where the rest of the meal went The stand out for me were the 48 hour shortribs they were tender and perfectly seasoned I wanted to lick my plate Elements has an extensive wine list and a knowlegable wine director to guide you accordingly They also have a nice mix of old and new school cocktails including creative non alcoholic choices a really smart move on their part because there are folks who don t partake of the hard stuff my teetotaling sister loved that the fact tha she didn t have to order a Shirley Temple It s wonderful to have such an elevated dining experience without having to cross a bridge Elements really delivers both in the quality of the food and the service 
hVkTRkU9mhbrawIlMFbWzA CMU Triumph Brewery is one of those places that if you have out of town guests coming you have to take them to Triumph The beer is great and it s just a fun place You can even take beer home I ve also recommended them quite a few times to my brides for their rehearsal dinners I m a florist and Manager Eric always does a great job for them They have two small banquet rooms upstairs so you can be semi private but still part of the action with a few steps to the balcony 
hY2agpC9PHr2JklOH_HcCg CMU Not sure what all the fuss it about Beer tastes like water and the food sucks I thought princeton being a college town would have at least one good bar guess this isn t it 
HzOb95qHOpjEA4OAlw8HaA CMU Happy hour here is great half price wines by the glass and yummy apps indoor outdoor fireplaces and firepits are warm and inviting Great place for a couple drinks with the girls 
I2lF0usHN4wnr5f4pj1DSw CMU Ate here recently with a Groupon coupon and the food was delicious and extremely well prepared We started by sharing the mushroom puff pastry which was served warm in a buttery pastry pocket Mushrooms were plentiful and cooked perfectly and the pastry was served over a light bed of greens lightly dressed For entrees I went with the Dover Sole stuffed with crabmeat and served with risotto asparagus and mussels all combined in a buttery sauce that was light but velvety A sliced cherry tomato dotted the dish My wife had the salmon served with grilled polenta and a ragu of vegetables She substituted her mussels with asparagus which were freshly prepared and tender This was another terrific dish Both dishes were beautifully arranged setting up the expectation of great taste which the chef delivered in spades The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 was that I needed to remind our server to bring the iced tea that I ordered But other than that the food was among the best we ve had service and ambiance were good and we wouldn t hesitate to come back 
I3vFukygcxSuClEknPAc7A CMU I ve eaten here a few times and agree with most of the reviews Generally the food is good but the menu is stale Most items have been on the menu entirely too long It needs to be updated The mixed drinks are incredibly expensive the appetizer section is weak Ditto the dessert section Much room for improvement in those two areas As you might expect the pasta dishes are excellent but if you want a steak you might want to try Char It s crowded at the bar virtually every night and it is difficult to be seated anywhere on Fri and Sat So if you re interested in trying their offerings try to go on Mon or Tues 
I4zGWtXJsIbHtfz12-bFMw CMU Well the tasting menu is a bust The best thing on there was the pork belly The worst everything else almost Whoever is in the kitchen needs to understand how to combine flavors The deer venison look its already dead don t kill it again And the so called apple funnel cake desert No apple no desert Some rosemary infused cottage cheese type of consistency substance that has me still gagging after I got home This disaster was preceded by another disaster pork suvee which made it taste like boiled pork Luckily my wife is an excellent chef in training that explained every one of these failures things to the staff and we were refunded the cost of the food Never again 
ICtW00Dc-PyAOMTddRPvrw CMU Triumph The great enigma They just raised their prices 75 cents a pint Which I find very curious since they seem to be making money hand over fist At 4 dollars a pint it was an unbeatable deal 4 75 a pint leaves you with a lonely quarter staring at you at the bar What Did they they think that the extra quarter would scare off customers Doesn t seem like it but I m sure it pissed some of them off Left me scratching my head The Food Well it s average Nothing extraordinary In fact they took the best sandwich they had on their menu off and when they put it back on the menu they altered the breadd which left it nothing to right home about For bar food it s well above average but for the price go elsewhere to spend your good hard earned money To save a bit just order the smashed potatoes at the bar They are amazing 
IFDGEu6AnYHOH4ooYdWzag CMU My husband and I ate here last night and enjoyed everything about our meal The staff was warm and welcoming from the second we walked in the door our server was super accommodating and knew everything about everything on the menu the food was A MAZE ING Definitely check this place out It s worth the money We started with the mixed green salad with peppered pears red pepper ginger etc Since we were sharing our server had the kitchen staff split the salad in the kitchen and brought it out on two plates My water glass was kept full LOVE the small touches For entrees we both had specials The hubs had yellow fin tuna with vegetable ratatouille and mashed potato He said it was one of the best tuna dishes he s ever had I had coffee chili cocoa rubbed pork with grilled shrimp caramelized onion gratin and corn salsa I can t remember the last time I enjoyed a single entree so completely We ll be back 
iFr3cEVVGWRh1JgIO3O2pA CMU A long walk down the hallway also brings you slightly underground towards the back of the building emerging into the micro brewery of Princeton The atmostphere here on campus is friendly and the crowd a mix of students parents and local residents Flatscreens rule the place and it is sure to be a place that attracts the sports crowd On this Saturday afternoon it was very light traffic so the large spacious environs seemed more than enough I think the high ceilings and skylight in the back would keep the place breezy even when crowded The actual brews were average at best some tasty but others just way off Priced at 5 it was not too hard of a hit to try a few The dark ales seemed to be safer than the stouts and lagers The food we stayed away from but it seemed a little ambitious for a campus micro brewery Moderate prices were not so bad but I got the feeling they were trying to make something fancy out of normal food mimicking a Manhattan gastropub I don t buy it though and think the place should stick to improving their beers 
igaXxEXRR-JyTjmdaqakeA CMU Don t know about the rest but I go there for burgers often and always leave happy that I went Also the tacos at the bar are surprisingly good 
ILt2a7gFSRblGLBQX6Gc3g CMU worth trying 
ini4Q5UEpzVQ0bwCejJzRg CMU I hate giving reviews when I haven t actually eaten there so let me preface this by saying the one star is for SERVICE ONLY Didn t even stay after the 4 hostesses gossiping at the hostess stand completely ignored us for over 5 minutes even though we stood right in front of them Several people had recommended it to us but the thought of good beer was not enough to overcome the crap service right when we walked in 
iRgqLDI3-GOEbMP6WYOtCw CMU Good steakhouse food but not standout for the prices 
Iu1V0LZXnQp3GgVmX6hGPg CMU It was loud and a bit too cold inside for my taste But the building had a great ambiance The hummus appetizer was delicious 
iZdnf1NeTrcU049-f_D11w CMU Went here on a sunday for brunch with my mother and brother to celebrate my mom s birthday The place was empty so there was no issues with noise The assorted cheese platter was delicious and from a local creamery I really like the fact that they support local farms in the area terhune orchard apples and dairy products from a creamery in north jersey to be exact Bloody mary was a little weak but had just the right about of horseradish and harissa My chicken salad had an asian twist which included soba noodles and a tangy asian sauce My mom had the french toast with fois grois and ice cream I can honestly say that Elements has the best french toast I have ever tasted The fois grois was cooked perfectly and absolutly delicious Expect your bill to be expensive but also expect a delicious and wonderful dining experience The staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly We were given a tour of the restaurant kitchen and wine room if you have the chance take the tour The restaurant offers a chef tasting menu where you can pair wines with your meal There is a corkage fee for up to 2 bottles 25 a piece I m looking forward to coming back to the restaurant for dinner 
j5u53wIyx0T8HcS63HAZeA CMU So I went here a few years ago and didn t enjoy it at all They refuse to let you split the bill The group was a table of 20 and we wanted to split just one person separate cause they had to pay separately Not to mention it was only 20 something dollars that was being taken onto a diff bill not like it was gonna make a huge dent to the bigger bills total i e included tip During the same meal I had a waitress spill half my chocolate martini on me and still made me pay the full price for the drink refused to remove it even though half was now on my shirt luckily I was wearing a brown shirt The food is okay nothing to write home about and I m not a fan of beer so there was nothing at this place that I enjoyed I know people like to come here especially if you like beer cause they brew there own but I think it s a little overrated and the service sucks here very snobby and rude I would never come here again Two thumbs down 
j6fglwaSNcfvm024Er4VsQ CMU ambiance and service was good but food and drinks were nothing to write home about and it was also quite expensive would not recommend it as you could find much better restaurants for this price 
J9UFazxxaePFvcQNDaSMig CMU I m not much of a beer drinker but this place has decent drinks and the food is pretty good too A favorite here is their burgers and fish and chips They usually have specials as well Prices are normal for Princeton but this place can be considered pricey otherwise 
JbG4OgcdaRYBSfX3OlmtgQ CMU While it s location is a bit odd on the busy route 206 and well away from the restaurant rows of Nassau and Witherspoon Streets Elements is truly worth a visit As noted in several reviews here the interior decor is neutral evens little bland but as your dinner arrives and conversation really gets going we found that the nondescript colors and comfortable modern furniture made for a perfect backdrop to an engaging social atmosphere It s a room that looks lively and complete with lots of people in it and the sounds of 206 traffic are completely blocked Our service was excellent During the course of our dinner our water glasses were kept full our meal was paced to exactly our preferred tempo and this remarkable feat was accomplished unobtrusively and with an unusual for Princeton professionalism I doubt the service could have been better Our dinner was simply outstanding well portioned small but not tiny made from absolutely fresh ingredients tasty and beautifully presented The four of us freely traded our plates and all of our dinners were new experiances and delightful This was our first visit and the only area where I would qualify my initial rating was with the wine list and there only because it seemed small and overpriced at first look On the whole Elements lived up to the high reviews here at least in our opinions and we recommend it heartily 
JbKiVHDczfksB1-wYNQ1Vw CMU Skip the food enjoy the beer I ve gone a few times for lunch and don t love the food kale and lemon salad almostly inedibly harsh and bitter But it s a fun place to go at night for cheap and good drinks 
JDWaEK9TeSRRITRdWq2o1A CMU I came here for dinner on a business trip I sat at the bar and had a flight of beers and the Epic burger which is served with pork belly caramelized onion fried egg truffle aioli and mornay sauce Talk about decadent It was DELICIOUS I had been on a really long trip with meals in the form of granola bars for the past 36 hours so I can t fully describe just how fulfilling it was And even though it was HUGE I devoured it And the yummy fries The beers were good I like Triumph on the whole It was cool to get small glasses of all that was on tap and the tasting was reasonably priced Overall the atmosphere is nice it was quite large and a lot more modern sleek than the other places I visited in Princeton The bartender was not even remotely friendly didn t seem too happy to be there but I had brought a book with me and didn t need someone to chat with It s just odd to me when a bartender makes no attempt whatsoever to be friendly with someone who is dining alone Maybe it was an off night 
JEtMe10e7sqePAgBqMTFxg CMU Fantastic The 4 course tasting menu with drinks is a revelation Service was excellent informative without being pushy and always there before you realized you needed something Going back later this week 
jf8yUnOSn5kuCPGeP7Kx3w CMU Went here on a cold winter day in December I had the Triumph burger well done and their seasonal beer and it was very strong and good The burger was great with grilled onions and still moist beef Whenever I run the risk of ordering a burger well done it can end up being a dry burger but this one was well cooked and still moist It was pretty much a great place to go with good service My gf liked it too She got the coffee beer a bit much for my taste but she liked it 
JiqlKWuD-E2svxjBHis3Vw CMU This place sucks You get in they charge you 5 for entering What s worst is the way they collected it like a bunch of gangsters Next the menu is limited besides the triumph burger which did okay there is nothing else that is good The band plays so loudly you can hardly hear yourself let alone chat Overall its over priced unfriendly and noisy There are better places in Princeton to get a drink or to find something to eat 
JjeTTeuF9C777urQin-U5Q CMU I came here for Princeton grad school visit and they had a buffet set up for us So I have no clue what was ordered but the BEEF is GOOOOD soft and tenderrrrr The banana foster is AMAZING Their ice cream has this very rich texture Where can I find it again 
JlB0HCNhnECLjOYFKp5Hog CMU hm food was good overall tasty shrimp and scallop special 1 for the calamari app it was a weird chinese sweet n sour balsamic sauce sauce on top ANDDDD there were SOOOOO many bugs it was really odd and super gross like 2 3 bugs flew into my wine when I addressed this with the waitress this is the conversation that went down me m am there are a lot of bugs here is there a reason a lot flew into my wine glass her yeah there are the end 
JMRMXLe721w4Lyk9jAJ13Q CMU One thing I appreciate about restaurants is consistency I enjoy knowing what to expect each time I visit and unfortunately I can t say that Salt Creek Grille provides me with this I ve come for both lunch and dinner and the service and food has ranged anywhere from 2 stars to 4 stars with my most recent being a 2 star lunch As a carnivore I can always go for a nice petit filet for lunch nothing hits the spot more than a medium rare piece I ve noticed that most restaurants will undercook your meat so that if it is not to your satisfaction they can always heat it up However when I get a well done steak when I ask for a medium rare piece the carnivore in me gets upset and cannot enjoy the wonderful meal taking place To their credit we had a large group in their banquet room so there were another 10 steaks they needed to cook but I typically expect quality food the way I ask for it when I come to Salt Creek I will note that their all inclusive prix fixe dinners 20 have never disappointed especially for the price and their calamari 14 is always a nice way to appetize is that a word with their happy hour drink specials between 4 and 6 30pm 
jTZAzCGFmUhdlTT6S-dSSQ CMU I like that this place is a microbrewery but I wish they had a bigger selection They usually have 8 beers 5 6 of them are their main drinks that are there all year round I like their honey blonde and winter wonderland drafts a lot Prices are okay 5 50 a draft If you re up for it they offer a sampling platter for beer you get a small sample of all the beers for 10 or 12 I haven t eaten too many of their foods although they do look good I ve had their hummus platter just because I m obsessed with hummus and it s okkk considering it s a not a real Mediterranean place I ve never really had a problem with their staff Once in a while I would encounter a waiter waitress that we would have to flag down to get something I think Harvest Moon in New Brunswick is a better microbrewery though Sorry Triumph 
JyZZ46vcBLgNvcJiY36WGQ CMU Triumph was alright within spitting distance to the Gothic spires and gargoyles of hallowed Princeton I wasn t a huge fan of the beers me and my buds got the samplers they seemed to like it for the most part the roggenbock was my favorite We sat upstairs for a late dinner following the Princeton Colgate hockey game Seems like a very happening place on a Friday night The bar was crowded but upstairs wasn t too bad We started off with the baked brie very tasty and the meat platter which was an assortment of cheeses and salamis with hunks of bread For dinner I got the open faced meatloaf sandwich very good Our waitress though efficient seemed cold We tried talking to her she was a Princeton student but when I asked her if she was a member of Triangle I thought she was going to smack me come on I m a huge F Scott Fitzgerald fan and I ve read THIS SIDE OF PARADISE I pretty much struck out there 
k0abQzayP88HwoLxl0VJEw CMU Came here for a late dinner on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed Definitely seems like a hot spot for Thirsty Thursdays I m sure the drinks are great but the food was so so We had the tuna ceviche calamari and fish and chips The tuna ceviche wasn t marinated very well I could barely taste any citrus Certainly not enough for it to be considered a ceviche The calamari was decent but a little salty The chips in the fish and chips were good but it s sad when fries are the best part of your meal Will consider returning for the live music and drinks 
K33-MeQ3qc2Oovpy7KjSMg CMU Probably the best beer in Princeton Crowded even on a Wed night 
K5AWv5fV_5PRElXo2OH9Yg CMU Perfect place for a brewery experience Make sure you get the beer tasting item 7 beers not in so tiny glasses just for 9 The wait is quite long but we didn t mind waiting at the bar area at all The atmosphere is very open and airy Food is not the greatest but better than the mainstream pub food Don t expect too much Portion is large I d definitely come back when I am in the mood of beer 
K6XpKwTjdm9NU5HiIhmjXw CMU Good food good portions free wifi but most of all the staff is very helpful i have visited them a few times this year already at Mercer 
k82aVXGLhC5lajx8BMioWQ CMU You know I really want to like this place I really really do however if you are going to put brewing in your company name you best have good beer Triumph beer selection is best described as hit or miss and honestly I ve missed more than hit I find a lot of their brews to have a watery homebrew quality which really disappoints There are some good ones and the brew miester does a good job of keeping a fresh rotation And I love the fact they always have a decent cast conditioned ale I just wish I didn t feel like I was spinning the roulette wheel with every order The food has always been really good here Fresh and innovative 
K8IDAIO23Gq69Gd2H6SfbA CMU Love at first bite is all I can say Butter mmmm Croissant best I ve ever had There is so much love of food at this place It s clean airy bright and rich There s really not much more to say except this place is a must if you re in Princeton 
kH8pD2MOpcI4MJbffF1vsg CMU For those of you who do not want to read the whole thing bottom line was amazing when it first opened and worth the price now go find somewhere else food is never bad just not worth the price they charge have been there six times total They get the three stars cause i know what they can do it has just been lacking of late Where to start i have been to Elements ranging from the first month they opened to yesterday for Valentines day I have never been for lunch and brunch only once Now for the fun My first two trips to Elements were amazing Great service paired with some of the greatest dishes i have ever had best ever was at Manresa in CA I got the tasting menu my first time w o the wine pairing and on my second visit i had four various plates ranging from a cheese board to start and ending with their Kit Kat The pricing up to this point was about right Maybe on the high side but plates were elegant and the flavors played a symphony on my taste buds I left both times saying wow i really want to go back From here is where things started to change Glad i built them up before i break them down Elements Amuse bouche s are absolutely amazing my favorite part of the meal usually After my first two amazing experiences the ones to follow fell short On one visit brunch the service overall was really good but i got no explanation on any of the dishes They were just dropped off at the table and left there for us to try and deceiver the plate puzzle Come on what do you mean you knew what you ordered right I know this is what you are saying but when you love food and it really grabs you by the balls like it does for me you want to know what every little thing is and up to that visit that is what Elements was doing To their credit that only happened the one time i went But still it bothered me enough to write about My next couple of dinners just did not hold up to the standard set in the past Nothing is ever uneatable or even bad but things started to turn Dishes were heavily over salted nothing was exciting and some of the proteins were over cooked I was starting to doubt Elements but wanted to give my girlfriend an amazing night out We had no choice so we went with the tasting 125 and since it was a special night lets have some drinks wine pairing 50 I left telling myself Craig you said this last time but really lets do it I am never coming back again unless someone is paying for me Not one dish played a symphony on my taste buds amuse was great the lamb was good but since it was over cooked not great and the cheese dish at the end i found very tasty Bottom Line I would have paid 300 with tip and not left upset but still prob would have never returned But when reality set in that i had to fork over 444 with tip for something that did not excite me i decided to join yelp I know the chef can produce spectacular dishes Am i just having bad luck when i go Or is is really just an OK place 
kh8XmDWL5usVZTzNKypEpw CMU Triumph Brewery is a nice change of pace from the dives I usually like to frequent It has beautiful interior design and more importantly yummy beer I personally like the amber ale There s a reason more Triumph s are sprouting up in New Hope and Philly For those that don t like beer they also have a full dinner menu full bar And they usually have live music on weekend that gets folks dancin 
KiNYnxo3Wis97R-56Y1eKA CMU My first impression of Triumph was great I went this weekend with a group that included a 2 year old and had a great time A member of our party was an architect familiar with the reno of the restaurant and I was thoroughly impressed with the design and the space Being from the micro brew capitol of the world I ve seen it all but really loved the huge glass windows behind the bar which revealed the brewing vats The split level also gave an amazing sense of space and I can t imagine how fun this place must be on a Friday night with a fun loud group The service was top notch The waitress and hostess were very accomodating to the fact that there was a 2 year old with us They found us a spot to put the stroller and were very patient The waitress even mixed apple juice with water in the baby s sippy cup for us I was in shock One woman in our group loves revising the menu at restaurants which usually draws ire from the waitstaff but in this case the waitress asked her if she wanted her panini as is or if she had add ons She was very sweet about it and our order came out very quickly I had a great green salad and the chicken lollipops with a sweet spicy thai sauce which were delectable Everyone at the table was grabbing for them and there were plenty to go around The salad wasn t too huge which at many restaurants they are and the greens were fresh and varied Everyone else had a sandwich The paninis were a hit and the gyro was excellent I was so impressed that the menu had some amazing offerings and it was far from pub food Oh and the beer My boyfriend had an IPA which was delicious I usually don t like IPAs because of their bitterness but this was very light and refreshing I didn t try any other beers but I am very keen to go back for a night of fun without the toddler and give the other beers a taste 
Kj2aB77g5EwmHnbWWXvCVQ CMU This place brews its own beer and they do a decent job But if you don t like beer don t expect the food to salvage the experience for you In all my times coming here the food has been adequate at best and mediocre at worst At least they re consistent 
KjCYdXWUEHt9plKH4zhwnQ CMU I had Sunday Brunch I don t really know what Cody Kendall was reviewing here But it s an unusual interesting building and nice decor with a fabulous exposition kitchen that includes a table that can be reserved there Maybe it s all of the above the eclectic cuisine and the wonderful friendly staff and service The chef is very creative It seems like the chefs creativity is about taking items from Pluto and Mars and marrying them Unfortunately what comes out is a 3 legged pig with 1 arm and a beaver tail From the Sashimi appetizer where I had to add soy sauce to it to give it some flavor or the Eggs Benedict with head cheese that s right head cheese that had an over powering anise flavor obliterating any creative sauce added or tasting the gourmet eggs And of course there s today s ever popular amuse bouche that was not very amusing The only thing worse than food that doesn t work is knowing that I overpaid for it If you have to go go for the experience of the restaurant and the creativity of the chef not for the best execution of a a dish you ever tasted 
KJmu8QQ0kvlVEXlKzFSWnA CMU when my friend came to visit me we ordered everything we thought looked interesting on the menu and in the end the smoked salmon appetizer and duck breast are the best some of the others are pretty bland especially the seafood margarita and i have no idea why they always recommend it 
KKPBCvQwntMdR_b2MThqfw CMU Just got back from Ferry House a few hours ago I was really satisfied with their menu a lot of it isn t traditional boring like pastas and such I was a huge fan of their mushroom risotto but I like mushrooms and risotto in general so I might have ignored a slight uncooked crunch in it but it was sticky enough to make me happy We also had one of their specials the crab margarita My boyfriend liked it I only liked it once we reached the bottom and there was more avocado salsa than crab The raw oysters these were from Long Island were said to be a medium size but they seemed meh sized to me Sauce was good though it wasn t a straight from the bottle cocktail sauce slightly more liquidy I didn t pay very much attention when she said what it was called For entrees I had the duck and my boyfriend had the salmon He said he liked his texture could have used some work but the flavor was good Apparently the duck dish had a recent revamp in appearance I don t know if that matters But the duck tortilla roll was delicious Everything else was just alright I wasn t a fan of the barbecue sauce but I m never a fan of ANY barbecue sauce so I can t really hold that against them boyfriend tried one of the duck pieces and he said it was a bit tough but good I just couldn t wrap my head around duck and barbecue sauce Besides interesting food the service was great The waitress I had her name started with a K sound Kallen or something was very nice She had a 1 2 minutes long recitation on the specials and I have to give her props for that either that or they don t change their specials often I m not sure She and the water guy hovered around our table a lot to see if we were done with our food or water respectively It was a half full house so they might have had nothing else better to do But I definitely felt tended to Dessert options aren t on the menu At the end of dinner the waitress presents a display of the desserts They all looked absolutely fantastic but I already had my heart set on the super cheap Halo Pub a minute away so we turned it down Good thing too our bill was over 115 not including tip Ouch Looking at the bill knocked off a star but we hadn t had a dinner date in a while so this place hit the spot 
KkZFAz-b-Q6EejHPZrqYBg CMU Food is good just bad call serving in plastic gives perception that food looks like bad airport food 
KOJSRW_zEgrhQ3s3MHltmQ CMU Skip down to the SUMMARY if you do not want the verbose narrative below Upon first impression you might wonder where Triumph is as you slide down the 100 foot long umbilical passageway that eventually delivers you to the brewpub Even though Triumph is not on the street where the entrance is this canal gives birth to images of prohibited speakeasies as you steal down this somewhat hidden corridor into fantasy as it allows you to soak in the slightly fetid smell that is characteristic of fermentation the aromatic offering of yeast gobbling sugars and pissing alcohol At the end once through the austere and overly practical double doors you crown into a semi magnificent three story view featuring heavy wood accents and ancient brick work married by rough edged cowen crafted mortar remodeled over the ages as old doorways were bricked up and new ones were cut in The resulting architecture settles somewhere between an old customs house and an English hunt club sans the stuffed heads of dubiously valorous kills Storied past aside which includes an unconfirmed account of this formerly serving as both a morgue and a brothel although presumably not at the same time this is now a truly impressive bar and my anticipation of glorious craft beers heightens As I scan the room I see many happy couples coworkers and friends imbibing laughing and talking Upon the wall is a chalkboard informing patrons of upcoming offerings detailing style gravity and expected birth date In the back I observe the mash tuns fermenters chillers serving tanks and other plumbing and equipment necessary to brew store and serve here in house High tops booths tables and bar seats all await your choice and pleasure As I meander downstairs I situate myself at the warm comfortable bar and see another chalkboard calligraphed with tonight s offerings Honey Blonde Amber Ale German Pilsner Imperial Stout Bengal Gold IPA Winter Wonder and a hand pulled Nutt s Brown Ale all available to go in growlers 17 or 13 for a refill On the shelves behind the bar I am further comforted to observe a really nice selection of scotch and whiskey Another board offers various bottled brewer s reserve offerings to take home Imperial Stout Barrel aged Imperial Stout Grand Cru IPX anniversary double IPA Barrel Aged IPX and a rare thing Honeymoon Braggot As a brewer I could not pass on the braggot a mead made with grain The friendly and as I am soon to discover informative bartender is quick to welcome me and ask me what I would like I tell him everything and am greeted with a large flight Meanwhile I scan the varied menu for dinner I see a good selection of pub food plus seafood salads and meats The lamb shank special offers me slight temptation but my anticipation for the wonderful selection of craft beers leads me to choose the delicious smokehouse Panini A terrific choice that ended up paring well with almost every beer as well as delectable in its own right Sounds perfect so far right Well it was before I tasted the beer Each and every beer I tasted was a miss This is unheard of In most the culprit was simply a noted lack of flavor There was no there there The Honey Blonde was flat the IPAs lacking in character and the expected hallmark hoppiness the Stout s too far from standard and just plain bland The hand drawn Nutt s Brown Ale was a poor choice for that delivery method as its high CO2 content left me far too burpy The Winter Wonder with its slight spice including clove ginger cinnamon and orange zest notes was good but not noteworthy The Amber Ale perhaps my favorite in an undistinguished crowd was smooth and drinkable with a nice malt hop balance Overall however the lineup was bland Bland bland bland bland bland Note upon a separate occasion I did try the Rauchbier and it was not bland at all On the contrary it was full of so many off notes that it was absolutely horrid and perhaps the single worst beer I have tasted in my life including skunked Grolsch SUMMARY As a note despite its generally characterless beers I have kept coming back to Triumph in the hope the I find something anything of value in their beers Especially since it is the only brewpub around the Princeton area I feel like Charlie Brown who kept trying to kick the football but Lucy kept pulling it away Alas I fear that Triumph shall never have good beers until they get another brewer and I have never even thought that about a brewpub before Beer Blech Bar Go for the Scotches or Whiskeys Ambiance Outstanding Food Limited exposure but in multiple visits I have never been disappointed in the delicious food Service Always top notch three stars despite the failings of it lead product TASTING NOTES Coming soon 
kOYz5eSV6wngPQHKciKJ7A CMU The portabella mushroom sandwich is amazing 
kpTTopSADMZlvKr6g9rn7A CMU Blows away most of the other Princeton restaurants Excellent service from a friendly and knowledgeable staff I have eaten there at least a dozen times and have never had a bad experience The menu changes regularly but signature dishes remain though with different treatments 
kU2bffyN8aZ_v55Za8ZvHA CMU Um so maybe I ve been spoiled by Boston and Philly but the food here did not live up to the inflated reviews The short ribs puree contained way too much starch and the scallops were a bit bland The king crab ravioli was pretty good however Overall a decent place in Princeton but certainly no match for the Philly standards 
Kv6qpxRSIPOAbGY_eoDOxw CMU I really wanted to like ONE 53 but I m not sure I ll return The atmosphere is great if you re into trendy The food was decent for sure but it wasn t great I m not sure exactly what was missing besides the other half of the portion from the entree to constitute decent rather than great but nonetheless something was missing for me I think this makes a great place for a date but don t bring someone here if you think they won t be impressed by the super trendy atmosphere Portions are petite however the prices are not Perhaps I would have been more impressed if I weren t vegetarian but it seemed the others the carnivores in my party had similar opinions Regardless of my opinion ONE 53 is worth a try even if it s not your favorite it s certainly not a bad experience 
Kw7H5wejRilXg8gGD9dVkQ CMU Wow this place is great I actually bought an online coupon for 25 off a 50 dollar meal but since we went for lunch and it was just the two of us we didn t use it Anyway I got the 1 2 grilled vegetable pita with special sauce tzatziki sauce with a salad I actually got the sauce on the side and just put a small amount on top of the veggies It was out of this world good Hands down best grilled veggie pita and best sauce ever I actually don t even like veggies all that much but am trying to be healthy It was comprised of zucchini and some other veggies It also came with freshly made hot potato chips which I enjoyed as well only ate a few The salad was fresh and delicious too My mom got the shopska salad which she enjoyed as well I saw another group eating some kind of shish kabob that was hanging in front of them and it looked awesome too I am definitely going for the shrimp one with my restaurant com coupon If you search for coupons you can get the coupon for 2 3 dollars vs 15 I paid 2 a while ago with some promotion Definitely give this place a try Update We went here tonight for my mom s birthday to to use the gift certificate Everything was amazing My mom and I shared two dishes the zucchini boat with fresh tomatoes feta and walnuts and the salmon ala greque and it s wild with tomatoes some kind of lemon dill sauce bulgarian rice small pile of veggies and potatoes with a garlic oil sauce Since I loved the taztziki sauce so much last time I got a side to dip the salmon in which worked together perfectly We really had a lovely time and were very impressed with the food and it was nice to taste something different vs the small old dish at a restaurant The only small criticism was the salt level which no one else even noticed I use very minimal sea salt in my cooking and so that might be the reason Oh and I also didn t like the oil for the bread although the bread was good 
kWDnnnElY_eHGNr1FKzK3A CMU Let s keep this short In sum their beer is quite good The food is overpriced and decent at best The service was hit and miss The space is very cool though so bottom line if you re just drinking and maybe just want some snacks go here If you want dinner don t 
KxElhZS-A8o04MnkPtE2lw CMU Great place Their beers are delicious always a fan of the Amber Ale and the food is pretty damn good too Prices are reasonable as well especially considering it s in the middle of Princeton Been here several times and they are very accommodating for large parties just let them know ahead of time The bar is a bit small unfortunately which takes away from the place in my opinion But you can t have everything right 
KXYUh_IMZS5GUFJaAqWvPQ CMU Had high hopes for this place was greatly disappointed Our waiter Gabe was arrogant Took forever to have our order taken he walked past our table several times but more interested in talking to some girl behind the bar Finally took the order our 2 appetizers took almost an hour to get Chicken Lollipops with Thai Chili Sauce which was very disappointing and greasy The appetizer pizza was not good either Our waiter didn t bother to give us plates to eat them with and we had to chase him down for utensils Big thumbs down will not be visiting there again 
Kyegcuk93drasTpi2h9J2w CMU The Princeton location of Triumph has an awesome layout find the small entry space and see the venue expand into a largesse of seating And of course their beer is wonderful I adore their Rye tastes like Rye bread We came for after dinner hanging out and drinks so we had no service issues take care of your self approach and had an easy time grabbing a table cloistered somewhat away from the turned up band good but we wanted to talk We ll definitely be back when visiting our friends in the area 
L68M9umY7gdfmWJr8dbwfA CMU Came here to celebrate a special occasion They had fresh flowers waiting coordinated by my husband and wished us a Happy Anniversary many times We ordered from the chef s fixed menu and EVERYTHING was perfect and delicious this is top quality right here Everything was AMAZING including the service Along with our dessert they even brought out a special plate of treats with Happy Anniversary written on the plate in chocolate It s pretty pricey so this is the type of place you celebrate something but totally worth it 
l7b-aXc5si0edoY_c0nsNA CMU Let s get the bad out of the way first The restaurant was really chilly Dinner for two after tax before tip was 96 Included two apps and two entrees Skip the shitake mushroom soup Pros Atmosphere is nice Service is excellent Bread and herbed butter is super delish Try the crab martini yum Definitely try the halibut and risotto yum squared Absolutely try the New Zealand rack of lamb standard on the menu yum 3 
L8oc3ornPJzVN3IdKP4_uw CMU As a young professional it s important to me that I have a place that I can take my wife family and friends where we are treated like valued customers Salt Creek IS that place My friends and family have developed great relationships with the waitstaff enjoy the food and think the drink selection is top notch We eat there about once a week and will continue doing so However there is one thing stopping me from spending more more than I already do The desert is VERY disappointing The souffl is dry and not really a true souffl The cakes are weird the creme br l e is mushy and the apple pie is strange The server has to mush the souffl with a fork and pour the hot liquid chocolate over the cake How weird So much for the molten center right Don t listen to the corporate office in CA They have no idea what east coast desert really is As a frequent customer do me a favor Keep it up in all areas but START OVER on desert Get rid of it ALL and try again It s so terrible Otherwise I love you I wish there were 4 5 stars because you re ALMOST there 
lFHcUCNGeRp_hE0lf9yVgw CMU The yellowfin was okay not very delicious Drinks were good I don t know if I d be back there again if it wasn t for a company function We were there for a work thing and the passed appetizers were pretty good The phyllo brie with raspberry compote was really good but anything beef or meat related was really dry The yellowfin entree I ordered was supposed to have a wasabi glaze Maybe they ran out of wasabi because it was coated purely in rice vinegar which has a really distinct taste Meh 
LfI-A42UxSMZnwon4lVeMg CMU I love how all the food here felt so DECADENT Every time I put a spoon forkful of their food into my mouth all I could say was mmm Bread it comes warm with this whipped garlic herb butter mmm App I had the portobella sp bisque which was topped with fried shoestring leeks and a slab of goat cheese smoothy creamy shroomy mmm Entree grilled yellowfin tuna with lentil lobster salad honesly this was my last favorite course of the meal I thought the lentil was too hard but the tuna was just right mmm dessert we shared the sampler choc creme brulee almond tart with cinnamon whipped cream flourless choc cake with vanilla ice cream mmm the creme brulee tasted like heavenly pudding tart had a nice balance of nuttiness and was not overly dense or sweet The damage only 160 for 4 Prob helps that this place is BYOB with no corkage fee not bad indeed 
LgezuaxAYr_3KmswmKH0zw CMU Triumph just didn t do it for me I m giving it three stars for the beer because that s why I d go back We had the sampler and all were well done and fairly unique The rye beer actually tastes just like rye bread Food was so so My sandwich was good but was a bit much turkey Brie walnuts grapes and I think apple My husband s burger was maybe medium rare when he asked for medium well The service wasn t very good and our water glasses sat empty for quite a while 
lGRiC0ZfvS0J9BmKM_S-JA CMU I think this place is overpriced and overrated Without the 25 Restaurant com coupon I would say that the food is not worth the 30 entrees I tried 3 dishes the Warm Duck Salad with Apple and Pecans Orange Tarragon Vinaigrette Balsamic Reduction Roast Baby Rack of New Zealand Lamb with Mustard Basil Crust Roast Pineapple Spiced Yam Red Pepper Infused Demi Glace and Grilled NY Strip Steak with Wild Mushrooms Sega Bleu Cheese Mashed Potato Cabernet Reduction The duck salad was pretty good The duck had good flavor and the salad was fresh The duck could have been a little more moist and soft but overall was decent The rack of lamb wasn t exceptional but was pretty good It was cooked medium as I ordered The yam was sweet and delicious However they put it on top of a sweet pineapple and I don t think sweet on sweet went too well together The strip steak was a disappointment Hey Ferry House have you ever heard of salt and pepper This steak was really bland and tasted like steak that I would eat at college dining halls drenched in gravy The mashed potatoes were very good at first but the bleu cheese soon became overpowering and I couldn t taste the potatoes at all Overall the bill came out to around 55 using the coupon I don t think this is a place that I would go to without the coupon 
--8RcuC1LWyTCE1WP5fYVg CMU I m teetering Maybe 4 stars Evoo is very good so I ll preface the 3 star treatment by saying that And perhaps I should be more generous since yes it was restaurant week and we all know that restaurant week is probably the worst time to try a restaurant for the first time but It still took WAY too long for each of our courses to be served and my glass was empty on 2 seperate occasions for 10 minutes or more Not cool But the waiter was other wise awesome very funny amicable and knowlegeable I m going to chalk it up to them being very busy but at the same time excuses are excuses nto reasons The dining room nice airy but a little too contrived I felt a bit like I was in a boloco or Arlington VA Inother words modernly vanilla But clean and comfortable so not bad overall The service I ve discussed above awesome in one direction crappy in the otehr HOpefully I was just a bit unlucky The food OK this is the most important category and yeah this is the real winner here The littlenecks in vegetable brothe with lambs bacon was pretty fantastic I felt a little wierd spooning the brothe but it was worth it very tastey Not a huge fan of the bacon but it added a lot of flavor so I could deal with it Main course BEEF sirloin over a grilled slice of marinated eggplant drapped in yellow and green string beans tossed with sweet corn and jalepenos both sweet and spicey This was really pretty freakin good especially for restaurant week The presentatio nwas really very nicely done adn the dish was really a cliched party your mouth Totally dug it Dessert ughmmas homer simpson drool chocolate truffle souffle presented in a lightly carmelized marshmellow pool Do I need to say more I tried to convince the waiter that I had dropped mine on the floor to get a second one He wasn t biting It was pretty effin good Ah Beverages I was pretty pedestrian last night just a few beers and a glass of pinot with dinner The beer was a local brew CDC or something like that slightly malty but had like zero aftertaste and was pretty refreshing for a darker beer not amazing but decent and I guess some of hte proceeds of the profits from the brewery support ALS So Curt Schilling I was helpin your cause out last night while getting a little buzz goin Wine was nothing extroardinary but good for ahouse glass I can t really complain since I was too lazy to look at hte wine list to pick something out OK so I guess I shoudl bounce this up to 4 stars I ll ponder it 
-0H-98olXR_8qiNapt_wtw CMU I came here on two separate occasions Once after a kayaking outing in the summer so we sat outdoors and it was a party of 5 and then in December for lunch with just my friend and I I didn t like it too much the first time I went and we all had a variety of pizzas there was a smoked salmon one a mac and cheese one a children Alfredo one and a portobello mushroom one I remember the mushroom and salmon specialties were highly regarded amongst the group Their earl grey iced tea was also tasty in the summer My December visit called for a mac and cheese pizza and a chicken with broccoli and caramelized onions with feta cheese pizza The mac and cheese one was good and gooey but needed salt The chicken specialty doesn t taste good if you eat it cold or if you warm it back up I highly recommend sharing these pizzas because even though they are personal pizzas 2 3 slices out of 8 really fill people up Also I have never gotten a salad here but they are not stacked on a bunch of lettuce just to add volume So if the menu doesn t list a lettuce or green do not expect it Just a heads up Oh ya this place is very busy in the summers but not for winter lunches We were the only ones there at 1pm on a Tuesday 
-1F1ImtGBFuNikZLy-u5ZQ CMU Go for the chocolate While their other pastries are fine the chocolate concoctions flour less cakes lava cakes etc are amazing The flavor is so good and strong a single small bite fill fill your entire mouth with bliss Combine this with a nice cup of espresso and you have the perfect after dinner treat 
-1hl1PMJ1alTzv0-zfPCEg CMU OOh where to start Rendezvous in Central Square you saved me last night After being treated like cattle at Tavern in the Square I harrumphed myself and my fiance down Mass Ave to have a little Rendezvous And by rendezvous I mean a nice dinner I had left probably the worst restaurant I have ever been to and not stayed to eat at because the vibe was just so horrible and walked into a haven of food fun and politeness what a surprise We were greeted by the very pleasant hostess who told us that their bar had 2 seats and that you can eat at the bar So that s what we did This bar is comfortable No whacking your knee on an ill made table like at that god awful place I left No loud people standing literally next to you and resting their arm on your table as you perused a TGI Friday s on steriods menu No no At Rendezvous in Central Square you might feel like you stepped into an oasis of culture warmth and good food I got the Saut ed halibut with apple butternut squash smoked bacon sage and cider butter sauce and I literally ate every morsel And I even used a piece of bread to delicately sop up the remaining sage and cider butter sauce and what a sauce it was Priced at 27 00 it is a bit steep for the portion but it is spot on for the quality of this dish I enjoyed it immensely My fiance got the potato gnocchi with foraged mushrooms black truffle piave cheese and for 13 00 this was an exceptional value Again portions were small He also got the turnip soup that he deemed delicious I tried a spoonful but it was not for me But most things aren t Their wine list is extensive and the gentleman who tended bar looked to be extremely well versed in all things alcohol He even tested each drink he made but since I m on the wagon I opted for water and it was Cambridge s finest Seriously if this was tap water it did not taste like it They should bottle this stuff For dessert I got a small cheese plate that was 8 00 it came with a beach plum jelly and raw cow s milk cheese from France some almonds and bread I got a cup of lemon chamomile tea it was perfect I m a tea snob this was some high tea Excellent I am not a fan of Central Square sorry folks But I am a big fan of Rendezvous in Central Square Thanks for saving me Rendezvous 
-2CL5jrnY2ezFBsTz2IBWw CMU I have a rule Only order stuff on menus that you can t or won t make at home Which is why cheesecake du jour and chocolate cake were my top two choices this afternoon Inside the restaurant Fabulous decor Because of it s plush interior I found myself craving some port wine even though it was only 12 30 PM when I went Then I realized that boozing chocolate would be amazing but I d have to walk home and when I m flopping around in the street screaming Chocolate Aaaaaargggh Delicious cacao bean how you torment my taste buds people won t know that I just had a drink too early in the day they ll think I m a crazy lady Cheesecake Slightly sweet with a nice blueberry flavor Excellent crust overall 4 5 to 5 stars But the Chocolate Cake THE CHOCOLATE CAKE I purposefully didn t take a sip of my water after my last bite just so I could wiggle my tongue around my teeth to find that last little hiding bit of fabulousness wedged in between my molars Absolutely 5 Whenever you go ALWAYS order something chocolate Don t go here for lunch Eat nothing or just a little something and then go for a giant delicious dessert and make someone go with you so you can order two things and try both Yes it s more expensive than Shaws cakes but you can t make this stuff at home I don t care how awesome you think you are Even if it looks like Finale desserts you won t be able to bridge the vast taste canyon 
-2Pihjs7klseF376C1EZVA CMU Beautiful service and food in a quiet tucked away corner 
-2Wld4W3ymXYiA2ktX-RwA CMU It s too expensive but i enjoy the concept Apparently they have a damn good burger but i didn t go that route The whole healthy eating concept can be maintained here but may be blown by the buffet style eating I enjoyed it but it was an experience not really a repeat customer type thing 
-2z7JmX595zRVaI3MvbZ8A CMU So far just a review of lunch I had long avoided F I amidst complaints it was too pricey or too gimmicky And because I was a vegetarian Well I finally hit the place up for lunch and I have to say I m a fan The little tagline of improvisational dining or interpretive dining or whatever may have made me want to retch but not the food and not the pricing Still I think cafeteria style hibachi might be closer to truth Here the main clarification that would have helped me figure out F I before I got there Most people say it s all you can eat while some folks complain about being charged for an extra bowl of food Well they re both right but it s the best of both worlds you start with a bowl for 7 95 which is smallish but can hold a great deal of food if you pile it on right Then if that bowl and a plate from the included salad bar and the rice and tortillas they bring to the table aren t enough to sate you you can convert the whole thing to endless trips for 3 more You don t have to decide first and you can easily get an obscene amount of food for 8 Just to emphasize you certainly don t as some people made it sound pay for an all you can eat situation but then get charged for additional trips That s just crazy talk It is gimmicky as evidenced by the fact that they had to give it a kitschy tag But that gimmick includes endless customization options Pick your veggies pick your starches pick your meats pick your sauce Or skip the veggies because there s a salad bar and skip the starches because you get rice and tortillas That s a honkin huge pile of meat for 8 and a good variety to choose from There was a good variety of sauces as well though the teriyaki I ended up with thinking I was playing it safe for my first time there was actually pretty bad There s also a sandwich burger option that seems to operate similarly but which I did not investigate But if the concept of an 11 all you can eat burger bar with all the fixins appeals to you by all means ask if that s really how it works I ll try to remember to ask when I go back and update here 
-3yOk60WTx5SkmSCqF_s1g CMU Awesome food great drinks Try the green burger or the chicken under a brick Both are excellent The Perfect Storm with its 5 year rum and ginger beer mixture is the perfect drink compliment to any meal Came here for Valentine s Day and it was surprisingly not busy The atmosphere was pretty good even though they were stuck on an early 90s rock metal lite music playlist The only reason I bring it up was that it didn t seem to fit the decor nor what I would imagine are their target clientele I can t complain though and it didn t spoil dinner in the least We were able to talk eat drink and just have a great night out They didn t rush us through dinner they seemed pretty happy to just have us sit chill for a bit Overall a really fun night 
-4gJYBJnk9QjMakpFwsUag CMU This spot sits in Harvard Square and is a nice after dinner treat with some pretty good drink recipes and nicely done desserts The menu offers all sorts of selections and some good after dinner wines toddies and coffees The prices are reasonable and the service is friendly and fast The decor is pretty cool and it was a real nice spot to venture after a meal and the hours are open late so there is no worry about closing time 
-4x24Ub932tc7QZ5Y9_6sw CMU If you are a strict vegetarian vegan or have specific food no nos Fire and Ice is not the place for you Because everything is cooked on one giant stove by a pair of old looking twins food constantly gets mixed together Everyone can expect to find pieces of food from their neighbor s bowl Overall the food is ok It s typically quite crowded so it can get loud The sauce can be quite heavy in flavor Don t feel obliged to fill the little cup with sauce Also you can request to have cheese added on top of your food or burger Also keep an eye on your food because they will always ask which set is yours while they are cooking If you don t know they ll add the wrong sauce to your food or they ll add your sauce to the wrong food 
-50HnKnKYRTMoJxidZhD7g CMU Do you like your homefries to come from fresh rather than frozen potatoes Do you like your omelets cooked in cast iron pans with butter rather than on teflon pans with some kind of ozone eating lubricant Do you like your grits home cooked for hours instead of poured out of cardboard box If yes the finest breakfast in all of Boston can be had here Plus it s reasonably priced and only really crowded on weekends They don t lie when they call the cooking fresh and honest Would be a homerun if they served loose leaf tea and kept the coffee a bit hotter Screw that Even with drab tea selection it s a home run and easy five star It s a bit on the fancy side with lots of power brokers and Harvard celebrities munching away But if you can get over that and don t mind eating breakfast off a freshly laundered table cloth you ll be in pig heaven 
-59JkbHjKKVHc5GwH78LMQ CMU Went with friends hoping to find a new restaurant to add to our favorites list Dined there on a Sunday night their prix fixe night Enjoyed a 3 course meal app entree dessert for 38 First course The Boston lettuce salad with cheddar and apples was a perfect combination of ingredients Entree I had the Bollito misto a delicious vegetarian selection Friends had the steak frites and Braised pork and veal meatballs Everyone enjoyed their meal Desset Pear crostada Filling but tasty Oh and their bread was amazing Reminded me of the yeasty flavor of When Pigs Fly bread Service was great too Highly recommend 
-5M6Hz3lVL1kgnJeC-xIWw CMU Definition of my perfect cold day meal 1 Flat Patty cheeseburger with tomato lettuce special sauce squished between that buttery Brioche like bun small fries and a Harpoon Root Beer Drool 
-5Z6wcI-Ag5WhJP1ileJeg CMU By far the best meal we ve had in the Boston area in a long time From the wait staff to the environment to the food to the drinks the place was top of its game We had a hightop table across from the kitchen were we could see all the action and everything that was plated made us want to order it We had the tasting menu and the favors got bigger and bolder as we moved through the meal I also need to call out the cocktails as they made the night We had a cocktail flight which meant we were able to sample 4 cocktails along with our meal I would strongly reco you try this as it was the perfect way to try drinks you might not order yourself Fantastic night 
-70iz_mHQ-Kq97OVpauQVA CMU Monday night karaoke is a blast Way better than anyplace else in Boston They have an unlimited music selection more than any other karaoke we have been to The staff was awesome and the atmosphere was fun Drinks and apps were very reasonably priced and fed the whole table for under twenty They even give away a 50 00 gift card at the end of the night I hope they expand to other days of the week 
-9lxMYj9g-AesIVC_RUq3A CMU If you re happening to be in Harvard Square you definitely need to check out this place I always seem to order the same thing grilled chicken sandwich and I finally switched it up and order pork pulled it was good but i definitely love their grilled chicken better The price is definitely affordable 
-9QorjguYxDcprwnqqkOOw CMU I like this place because I eat a lot and I think it s fun putting them together for them to stirfry together for me BUT everything always ends up tasting kind of the same after awhile Fun nevertheless I think that s most of the appeal 
-aeMhY03z88dS1EmTLIBIQ CMU Delicious I came here with a friend and neither of us could decide on what to get so we decided to split The Whole Nine Yards which is a sampler plate of nine of the restaurants top dessert items I honestly don t think I can pick a favorite of the nine items They each had their own unique character and some had interesting flavor combinations It s a bit pricey and it took a while for us to get our desserts but for the quality of desserts prepared on our plate it was well worth it It was art You can t rush art 
-Aka1qQw_89C9FZYOo3hWA CMU I have been here several times and would definitely go back as the food is delicious and that can usually trump any other small issues that one may have with an eating establishment However the service is not amazing sometimes I felt like they forgot about my table Also I have been on a Sunday for their brunch and I had the eggs benedict which was great however don t go if you don t want your brunch interrupted by the sounds of some Harvard mens acapella group I know it s supposed to be fun and kitschy and all of that but I guess I m not old enough to appreciate or enjoy being sung to by a barbershop quartet while I m trying to enjoy my eggs It was just annoying 
-aKI6fKZyutLUOSLPYv-FQ CMU Shaped like a double wide old train car diner and styled like the 1950s in outer space VG packs its punches in hip friendly waitstaff cool d cor and most of all blast off out of this world delicious space food that s light years away from Tang The diner specializes in vegetarian vegan versions of classic diner fare such as a facon B L T grilled seitan and greens and Vegetable Tofu pot pie In the end I couldn t decide on one entree so I ordered a smattering of sides including the soup special of the day Caramelized Onion Soup The soup ended up tasting rather eggplant y and the consistency was thicker than I d hoped It would have been better with cheese but still it was pretty tasty Most of the menu is vegan or has a vegan option available Hash was my next epicurean adventure The hash came with salty diced potatoes and spicy seitan It was my first time ever getting to try the diner standby I loaded it up with ketchup and sriracha from their cute little racha saucer and it was delicious My last dinner item was a black pepper biscuit yet another item that I was thrilled to see on the menu VG s pepper biscuits weren t exactly Southern style but smothered in butter or some butter like substance they were moist and damn delicious One qualm though with this and with the lemon merengue pie vegan merengue Yes How the eff did they do that the prices did seem a little overinflated to me 2 95 for a single biscuit 6 50 for a smallish piece of pie Knock these off by a dollar or half and a little more old school charming diner cred would be bestowed But everything was so good I can forgive the inter stellar aliens this Still 5 stars for ingenuity Full review on my blog Thoroughly Modern Milli Vanilli http bit ly nedozu 
-AnasHXEOhpP4_nX0jg9Pg CMU The crowd here is old white and middle upper class So if that s your type go for it I ve had some tasty things here but it s too expensive and touristy for my tastes For good food go For great food that s unique go elsewhere 
-BKbLY-4q92XoKUf3gkoWw CMU Good for a fancy date A bit expensive but very good 
-bpGnoc4c7R2nvCoGYe1Rw CMU Henrietta s table is an elegant place to eat well prepared food The menu has a New England slant The food is uniformly hearty and fresh made with wonderful ingredients Even the bread is terrific Prices are a little high Service is very good Parking is awful be prepared to use the hotel lot or take the T 
-bUZppH9XZP4kWpg2LMjTQ CMU I ve been twice and never ate fresher or tastier food 1st time a la carte second time a pescetarian tasting menu amazing Farm to Table What more can I say I mean octopus that was as tender as a white fish or salmon and I thought I didn t like octopus I could talk all day 
-bWRRrcSg1m4wN5YVuvgug CMU I ve eaten inside and out upstairs technically that s the Enormous Room but it s all the same team and down and CK is a good place to have close to home They just made the outside option a reality like 2 weeks ago and when the weather isn t too hot it turns out to be a great place to sit and drink and eat Every dish you get here will be heavily salted including passed apps for functions at Enormous but I love salt perhaps cause it makes me want to drink and I love to drink I do need to throw a small demerit for chronically inadequate salad options That it is next to Rainbow Alley aka Candyland Smack Pass TagLab is a big plus for those of us who are artsy by inclination Really good graffiti and a good place to hang for a smoke Also you d expect the Alley to smell a lot more like urine than it does Not sure how much CK contributes to keeping unsavory aromas of that sort in check but it lends a much greater sense of hygienic cred when a place can so tastefully dispense food in such immediate geographic proximity to what should naturally be hotspot of fermenting urban stink CK as woman classy and dignified in frequently unpleasant surroundings Makes your mouth water for more when you get a taste Knows some good tricks plus she ll gladly send you upstairs to hang with her sister if you re into that sort of deal She s seasoned rather than young and fresh but she s still got her figure and knows how to use it Plus she s recently developed a taste for action outdoors when weather permits so she continues to be open to new experiences 
-bwx9-WR2nQBBzdRHEzmSg CMU Went there with family on st patricks day Real good meal and the beer was great 
-bXCoiZZ0OaZ5LzClpWsGw CMU I have loved Rendezvous since it opened and come here all the time I ve never had a bad meal the cocktails are delicious the ambience fantastic and the owners seem like super nice people who really enjoy food However One star had to be deducted for the male bartender I believe his name is Brian While I have never experienced anything but impecable friendly attentive service from everyone else at this restaurant he has always been rude inattentive and poorly performed his job The first time this happened I thought maybe it s an off night we all have them The second time I also let it slide However it happens everytime I ve sat at his bar As I have bartended myself my standards are pretty lax keep my beverage filled ask me if the food is okay and say thank you when you drop the check and you re guaranteed over 20 I understand if you re busy but don t chat with the person next to me for 20 minutes and ignore the fact that yes I would love a second glass of wine There really aren t any excuses for service this bad particularly when one is dropping over 100 on a meal It s enough to make me not go back but I ll probably just find nights he s not working and frequent Rendezvous then 
-BZSBtvJ2UMi99TKCkmylQ CMU Food was good you get to make it yourself The first time I went to this place I really liked it because of the novelty However once I went to this place another time for a creative night out it really didn t get me going Despite all of he choices they all seem to be limited to either an asian or a north american style of eating I wound up being unimpressed the second time Also the service could be better and the menu could be more accurately priced it s structured somewhat oddly 
-BZuj6ugqJhnfWXcDPGiVQ CMU after TWO WEEKS of calling leaving messages etc i was finally refunded the overcharge not one call was returned not one NOT OK even if it were a 10 overcharge and this was a 72 overcharge 3 times the bill amount totally unacceptable 
-CLbDoW-76hsZqx-KwajwA CMU Yuck Nasty greasy burgers and fries 
-CnlR2h_4idIGA8214zt5A CMU Wow what a perfect place right in the heart of harvard square This is a nice classy place with an excellent drink selection and awesome food I had a burger that was juicy and perfect The people I was with were raving about how good their pizza chicken and perogis were This is a nice clean and classy place to grab dinner and get some drinks They have a late night menu too making this the perfect harvard square destination 
-CWepnrxh-bhXt6zjv6XFg CMU I d been wanting to try Upstairs on the Square for a while and used Restaurant Week as the opportunity to do so I seriously wish I hadn t though I think that the only good part about the dinner there was the fun decor The service was just as bad as many of the reviews claim and I ended up eating more of the cold flavorless bread in the bread basket than I wanted to due to the fact that I was starving and none of the food was coming out I ordered the asparagus appetizer sole and lemon cheesecake off of the restaurant week menu and my companion ordered the tagliatelle with bolognese The asparagus appetizer consisted of a maple sugar custard with a few large spears of asparagus and a bit of mesclun The custard was a bit lumpy instead of being creamy and smooth and the asparagus was bland and waterlogged My entree was by far the worst part of the night though The lemon olive oil poached sole with artichoke chips and artichoke a oli that had sounded so delicious on the menu was near inedible The fish had been so overcooked that the consistency was more like mashed potatoes Not exactly appetizing The a oli had separated so there was an oily puddle on the plate and the greens that came with the dish were so soggy and flavorless that I took one mouthful and couldn t eat any more The only semi decent part of this dish was the one lonely artichoke chip that came on the plate it had a nice lemony flavor The tagliatelle with bolognese was the only decent food of the night and I ended up splitting most of that since I couldn t bring myself to eat the fishy mashed potatoes The Meyer lemon cheesecake with roasted pineapples was another disaster The crust was beyond soggy and the combination of the lemon and pineapple made for a seriously odd taste I tried just the cheesy part of the cheesecake without any of the pineapple or the crust and that wasn t half bad but the whole combination was not pleasant I might come back someday to try the tea service in the afternoon hopefully the service is better then but there is no way I would come back for a meal I still can t stop thinking about those fishy mashed potatoes so disgusting 
-D3Vy7mkOZWgX3RhOrqncw CMU I started off with a lovely red wine Valle Reale from the Abruzzo region It was the evening s special wine To start I got the seared scallops which were perfectly caramelized and served with a small selection of interesting and unusual greens The waiter helped us identify the marsh samphire and was generally very helpful My main was the duck three ways the confit and breast were excellent but I found the spices to be a bit over powering in the sausage Our table ordered three desserts the lemon buttermilk pudding with huckleberry sauce polenta olive oil cake with honey lavender ice cream and spiced cherries and the vanilla bean panna cotta with mixed summer berries and pistacchio biscotti There was no unanimous favorite The panna cotta was rich and creamy and the fresh berries were an excellent complement The polenta cake was a surprising success The cake itself was a bit crunchy and added an interesting texture to the subtle palette The lemon buttermilk pudding was my least favorite personally although I loved the huckleberry sauce The Italian muscat wine was a lovely companion the waiter helped us identify where to get it either the Wine Cheese Cask in Somerville or Blanchards in Allston The atmosphere was very casual but the decor was still trendy and refined The waitstaff was friendly and helpful we asked numerous questions about the dishes and our waiter sought out any answer he didn t know himself 
-dewq6ezYRTgDyCKz8Misw CMU Wow what a difference a year makes When I lived in Central Square last year this was a run down Burger King frequented by the rougher elements of Central Square Now it s a fancy pants dining establishment that ranks among the best of Cambridge First and foremost the bar Wow What a phenomenal Manhattan Great drinks Our waitress was super friendly and low key which was great Let us take our time which is saying something because it was a Friday night I started with the gnocchi appetizer which as has been noted below is fantastic Perfect for a Boston winter night Dinner was the fish stew which was recommended to me by the waitress I don t recall all the fish that were in there but it was floating in a nice curry sauce with just the right amount of rice and was a treat Great job Only misfire was dessert My wife ordered a strange vanilla flan dish which we just didn t care for Overall a fantastic treat tucked right in the middle of Central Square We ll definitely be back 
-Dp-Q6HU4tvTx6eariof3A CMU A perfectly fine gastropub in a very convenient location in Harvard Square literally cater corner to the T Portions on the main dishes are generous and the dishes we tried steak frittes and pan roasted chicken were well seasoned Good beer selection and a nice looking variety of pretty bottles behind the bar for what it s worth we re no experts on mixed drinks While the place looks small from the street it is actually ginormous with a second large bar and dining area downstairs 
-DpMnNB7e6-kpPy4FbsjqA CMU Henrietta s Table gets the bump up to 4 stars because of their great outdoor patio seating I got their Salmon Sandwich with some fresh lemonade both were very good although nothing out of the ordinary They definitely appear to use high quality ingredients in their food A good option in Harvard Square if you re looking for something close to fine dining 
-dz0yFCaj1OJbjBJvTFQog CMU Over rated and overlooked It s nice for the older fourty plus crowd Bland if u ask me 
-E78Jv6UIa0EnjVrfi8E5Q CMU Great service very friendly accommodating prompt etc We had the ramp brebis and focaccia appetizer and it was DELICIOUS I had the paella next and it was good not too salty but for the price I would ve expected a bit more seafood Topped it off with cappuccinos which were also very good I d go back if I were in the area for a nice dinner It s definitely pricey but you pay for the whole experience 
-eNQZc0QSSXQCfoKWprSvQ CMU Most gigantic glasses of wine ever The bar is downstairs Not crowded after work 
-fHUP6HAu8oEjAhj0kgqmA CMU Visited this establishment a while back and thought it had a really nice atmosphere and great service but unfortunately my food experience was a little disappointing At least half of the dishes I had on my tasting menu were not cooked well or were underwhelming I had really looked forward to the six course tasting here having heard so much about it In many ways I was impressed We had technically more than just six courses if you count the lovely jasmine infused panna cottas that were complementary I may have had an irregular experience but tastings aren t things I can afford to try multiple times at the same place if my experience the first time was mediocre I really loved the salad and desserts but am terribly disappointed by the pork belly It was unbelievably salty The same can be said for the other meat dishes and makes me wonder if I just got the bottom of the pot they did say at first that they ran out Aside from the meats I did thoroughly enjoy the unique flavor and pairings of the other dishes but being a meat lover not having a well flavored meat dish put quite the damper on my evening 
-FHYkx_9einYF1D-PqsTyQ CMU This restaurant is worth every dollar you spend there Fine dining at it s absolute best in Cambridge The place is spotless intimate cozy warm inviting the staff treat you as if you are coming into their home The food is prepared as art and cooked perfectly I had a wonderful birthday experience here my boyfriend and I devoured everything on our plates and excitedly shared bites If you re looking for a place for a special occasion and you prefer a small intimate local hidden jewel type of experience this is it 
-FOXn4xDZUNNwxxXuITlgQ CMU I walked past green st grill 3 times before i found it really This is the place ok well lets see 3 tacos on wednesdays spending more on drinks than you do on food Hoping this doesn t sound alcoholic its just a that great of a deal 
-GDPLE0vuEohEI3UA1r4lg CMU Hands down one of the Boston area s best restaurants The menus dinner weekday breakfast weekday lunch Saturday brunch Sunday buffet brunch are all great The setting is a real pleasure with lots of airy open space The staff are friendly and attentive If you ever have time on a weekday morning go to Henrietta s for breakfast Trust me it s not what you would expect from a hotel restaurant You will not want to leave Which reminds me most hotel restaurants inexplicably stop serving breakfast by 10 00 at the latest Henrietta s serves breakfast until 11 00 My kind of restaurant The Sunday buffet brunch is spectacular with oysters on the half shell shrimp cocktail salads vegetables meats eggs a fantastic array of desserts and a lot more 
-ghVKuA0CsGUu4cnt69ivg CMU The hostess came by the table 30 minutes after seating us to let us know that there were people coming in after us and that we should be mindful of the time We ignored this comment as it seems somewhat ridiculous and ate a decent but definitely overpriced meal Then as we were waiting for our friend to return from the bathroom the hostess returned to our table to remind us that we had exceeded our two hour time limit and essentially asked us to leave When we confronted them that we had never experienced this type of treatment before the owner came over introduced himself and said I am the owner We didn t know what to say to that He then defended the hostess at one point rolling his eyes at our discontent I have never received service this poor in my life I should also mention that at the beginning of the night when there was a thunderstorm going on three of the people at our table had drops of water land on our shoulder head and hands To remedy this problem they moved our table two feet over after which we continued to feel occasion drops that went ignored 
-HClzgw11peSjvp5VOVIDg CMU Bottom line Great service great food decent prices great atmosphere High quality of food and service One of my top 3 favorite places in Boston and Cambridge also like Silvertone for comfort food and Grill 23 for steak I recommend the sunny room that faces the square for best seating Food soup was great burger was great and sandwiches all really good I prefer lunch here over dinner because of the lower priced lunch menu and beautiful sunny room Upstairs on the Square bucks my hypothesis of only eating out at comfort food places in Boston Frankly I can cook better at home than most fine dining in Boston not true for NYC or San Francisco so the only reason to go out to eat is for comfort food that is inexpensive and has decent service 
-HfXVChWIwidrQLrUkR7gA CMU I was ready to LOVE this place We went for my mom s birthday brunch The plus is that it is handicap accessible so my 91 year old granddad could come The minus BIG minus was that the room we were seated in was infested with flies The flies landed on everything the bread the plates the utensils faces hands hair it was really really gross And we weren t the only ones bothered by this the flies were all over the only ones who didn t seem to notice were the staff The service was appallingly slow We couldn t get a drinks list and then when we finally did it was a different waiter who took the drinks order Eventually our waiter came round to take the food order Then the food finally came out but then our waiter never came over to check on us even though by that stage we were all ready for another drink When we found another waiter to bring us coffee our waiter finally came rushing over and was annoyed that we bothered someone else for coffee By then we were all practically finished with our meals anyway And we are not fast eaters we actually like to sit and savor the food and the company Not only that but he then barely filled the coffee cups In my unofficial opinion on breakfast being chintzy about coffee is a bad sign We passed on dessert because we sort of wanted to get out of there while it was still daylight When we finally got the check the waiter gave us the wrong check Ugh what a mess but we still tipped 20 hopefully the tips are pooled I really can t get past the awful service And the flies Blech Swatting them away was not my idea of a fun brunch The food was really good even if my eggs were somewhat undercooked But they were farm fresh eggs and very very good But I am not likely to go back for brunch Nor am I likely to refer anyone to the brunch Not at those prices with that service And those darn flies 
-iI0i_-fqj9sia8JCjwjpg CMU It was what it was I would return knowing what I could expect Service was professional food was predictable The Caesar salad was dressed while the lettuce was wet and overdressed and so the flavors were completely diluted or again it was overdressed and the dressing has no flavor but the deviled eggs passed muster without being thrilling a burger was decent though the fries need work blanch them first please In word middle of the road somewhat upscale beer wine and burger place that does a little extra 
-jO62aBGXUs67NH7a0a7BQ CMU Wow what a let down The menu looked amazing yet almost every dish successfully disappointed Service was good although it wasn t clear how familiar our waiter actually was with the menu When asked the difference between the maple beer and their house beer he said that one had a maple finish and the other didn t very helpful Their house beer with pig in the title tastes like a bad homebrew Definitely stick with familiars like the IPA We asked for his recommendation between two dishes pork chop and lamb and he said that he didn t really like either again between another set of choices he couldn t enthusiastically endorse one over the other I m all for honesty but this was a bit much The appetizer a salmon salami was great Really delicate and nice flavors A highlight of the meal The crab cakes were tasty although we both found pieces of shell all throughout them ick My entree the duck was overcooked think dry thanksgiving turkey I sent it back and explained that I would like it a bit more rare The returning dish was practically still quacking it was so raw Again it went back to the kitchen As they have an open kitchen I was able to see the chef line cooks arguing with our waiter about the done ness of things The third attempt was cooked appropriately and was nice Food came out quickly almost too fast in fact We barely had time to finish up our appetizers before they were whisked away and entrees were before us I appreciate prompt service but this was altogether rushed We asked to see the manager who came over and apologetically let us knew he d been informed of the duck situation We also let him know about the shells in the crabcakes He comped the duck and also brought us out a few nice cheeses for dessert I really appreciated the way that the mgmt dealt with things and attempted to make it all better All in Henrietta s was not what we had hoped for 
-jOmP6MUeirI9O_eM7bkDg CMU I was lucky enough to get to go to the soft opening I d heard they were having I was prepared to cut them some slack since I figured they d need to get their routine down but no slack needed cutting They were totally on the ball The service was perfect and extremely friendly and the food was outstanding The place has a cool diner vibe but more airy and open You ve got a lot to choose from on the menu and I m pretty sure they serve breakfast all day Thank you They have a build your own burger with a ton of different topping options The hard thing is deciding What I really appreciate is the fact that they make most of their ingredients in house things such as their seitan their applesauce and their vegan mayonnaise It s not store bought stuff The desserts were even more incredible We got peach pie which I don t even want to think about because it just makes me want some right now It was made with fresh peaches and the crust was so light and flaky yet crispy ok must stop thinking about it until I can go there again And the vegan blueberry cheesecake unbelievable Why didn t I get any to take home why why why I will learn from this mistake Anyhow I can t wait to go back and try everything on their menu most of which can be made vegan we were told So psyched about this place 
-kHpvFIUIV_45m4d0Sw75g CMU I stopped in for some dessert tonight with a friend and we had a lovely time Our desserts were delicious but what really sealed the deal was the wonderful service we got from our server Carolyn She was so friendly attentive knowledgable and an absolute delight I would definitely return to this location we left with our hearts as warm as the molten chocolate inside my friend s cake 
-KOzZqge0avDKTOjJllaeQ CMU Shortly after I joined Groupon one popped up for Think Tank so I went for it I finally got around to going there with my girlfriend last week on date night and it was fairly disappointing First off we went in at 7pm on Friday night and it was maybe half full This was not the most auspicious sign for a place in Kendall Sq but not a dealbreaker The decor was somewhat spare although they did have a working photobooth at least it was working until two young girls took too much advantage of it The music was 70 s 80 s lounge which was a plus although it was also much too loud We each ordered beers which were reasonably priced at 5 50 on draft For an appetizer we got the crispy pork belly It was tasty and a little bit crispy but I think I was expecting a little more wow from it the gf loved it though For main course I ordered the Seoul burger and gf ordered the Ramen The Seoul burger seems to be their signature dish but it didn t blow me away I ordered it medium but there wasn t even a hint of pink inside The egg is a great touch the bun is tasty and the horseradish aioli was nice The meat wasn t anything to write home about and all in all I d say it was a decent burger but maybe not a 10 burger Plus the sweet potato fries were quite limp The ramen was alright but again not that impressive If you re going to put what is typically college survival food on the menu you should give it some pizzazz and the roasted root vegetables tried to but didn t succeed For dessert we were excited about the State Fair dessert cotton candy caramel apple and funnel cake but the cotton candy machine was broken Disheartened and overall disappointed in an over priced but average ly tasting meal we gave up Service was good our waitress was highly attentive perhaps overly so at times I thought she was going to plop down and join us but I think part of this was due to the lack of busy ness in the restaurant Overall if I lived down the street from Think Tank I might go occasionally for a drink but the food isn t good enough to merit the prices and the trek there 
-lS6WGMH6UCefN3yzHlrQg CMU The warm beet salad with goat cheese was delicious and much larger than expected The steak was a little salty as were the frites but sometimes salty is delicious While the cocktails may be on the expensive side our vodka sodas were large and strong Service Not bad but not particularly good either 
-m5n0PZVgrhSAaQUgTBzng CMU Fancy place The food was very good but only small portions Also very pricy What was interesting during the evening three of us got a Toronto and its taste alcohol content and the amount served vast differed in each case I was lucky and got the most alcohol and also the largest amount this was good Also tried the two other drink and at least one was not good We talked to them about it but it was not properly fixed They did not offer to replace the drink 
-m73irTk1N5IQCcUdFTreQ CMU The only good thing about this place was the waitress She was sweet and attentive though not mind blowingingly good I can t believe how crappy the rest of the experience was My friends and I had reservations for days and were really looking forward to it But then we are being walked past dirty empty tables and were brought to a booth shoved in the corner of the back exit with no light and a sticky table I kindly asked for a new table and was initially told no but then I asked again and said we d be willing to wait The host went and got another hostess who walked back and said we could but we d have to wait 30 minutes despite that fac that were were only a few people in line and SO many tables just dirty and waiting to be bussed So we got stuck sitting in the darkest corner booth imaginable by an area where they store stuff just terrible And the food was awful Our vegetables weren t cooked because they didn t steam them at all so thanks for the luke warm pasta and hard broccoli really worth the money Just not worth the time seriously 
-MnQ-A0kJ5syzTtb5qTFOw CMU 3 5 Stars Great New England cuisine They pride themselves on local farmed ingredients and the freshness definitely plays out The food here definitely has a lot of flavors The service was also good Definitely come here Sunday to Thursday for the discounted 3 course menu I have two complaints about this place though First the side rooms are not very well decored like the main room Second the portions on the dishes are inconsistent My girlfriend ordered the Mahi Mahi and it was cheaper and has more food than my dish I ordered the sea scallops for 27 and it has three pieces Note This place is louddddd 
-mSkS1icyHpGKpBMafaTTg CMU Came here and splurged a bit on the Chef s Whim 6 course tasting From an amazing amuse bouche of squid noodles to a couple more than satisfying desserts everything was top notch First few were seafood the squid noodles crab scallop then faro pasta hanger steak ice cream and flan a couple macaroons to round out the night Trust the chef he knows what he s doing And he s very generous with the portions we left completely stuffed Waitress was very nice though we did have countless servers throughout the night Tucked away on a side street just behind Toscanini s this place is really a gem Makes me a happy girl 
-NmbLCAqRiGkzmjhw3_TwQ CMU Gorgeous Upstairs on the square is an experience for the eyes and nose taste is controlled by your ability to smell After my third visit to Upstairs I still find this place exciting and now even more rewarding since meeting Matthew the Director of Ops He has an incredible ability to remember a face and insures fantastic service While the food tends toward the expensive side Upstairs offers local grown vegetables and meats and local seafoods in ways you wouldn t think to enjoy in your own home It is a lovely locale to treat a friend your mother anyone special though I maintain that some men can t take the decor too many times in a year 
-O0mZsAZn0dJmv6eVqzJeg CMU I d been wanting to go to this place for a while after seeing it s successful ratings and popularity on multiple sites including this one and hearing about it constantly from one of my friends So one night after heading home from a Bruins game my buddy and I not wanting to part ways quite yet we decided to head over there for a drink and some grub Unfortunatly for us by the time we got there they stopped serving food that sucked but it did our wallet a favor considering that their food is way overpriced I looked at the menu and was shocked at home expensive it was I go out a lot and it s the first time I ve seen a pulled pork sandwich hit 11 Honestly But there is one thing that in my opinion enabled them to escape with minimum review damage and a whooping four stars and that is their drinks menu They have some classic cocktails that you can t really find anywhere and that s I m very fond of Pimms Singapore Slinger Caiparinha Even the mojito FINALLY A PLACE THAT POURS THESE WHOOOHOO And for that alone I m a fan Needless to say that I had alcoholic drinks as my main food group and dinner that night Well worth it The decor itself is pretty cool and trendy and finding parking in the evening or night isn t usually too hard The bartenders are knowledgeable and actually talented compared to most I ve seen in Beantown they know what they are doing And it reflects Definitely a chill place I will be back 
-ojFOuyxCNM1GKkHYpI4Gg CMU Went Last Friday and We had Last Smash and Moscow Mule Cocktails Domaine Cheveau Macon Chardonnay Cheese Plate Bone Marrow salad Loup de Mer and the Swordfish Total bill 185 before tip Very reasonable All the food was delicious Though my swordfish seemed bland it was a delicate umami flavor I blame myself for ordering a mild flavored dish after eating rich and awesome bone marrow my first time Her entree and salad were both excellent and the cheese was phenomenal Cocktails were out of sight and the wine was very nice The service was average Our server was attentive but in a pushy way and after every sip of water a staff member topped off our glass of water Also the bar high top chairs felt purposefully uncomfortable with short cushions and no place to rest your feet Overall we were treated very well and enjoyed our evening immensely The wine list was priced a little steep but I am comparing it to other lists that are purposefully reasonably priced The food was very very good The service was totally adequate and the atmosphere was fun The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is that I had really high expectations for the best restaurant in Boston and felt that it fell a little flat I am totally going to give it another try though 
-oMv2Si4Ie45sW8YVDWkyw CMU I dig this place and while I ve only gone for cocktails they re pretty awesome The drinks are reasonably priced around 6 8 and boy howdy there are a lot of them 6 pages of cocktails plus a couple on the specials menu There are a handful of egg based drinks on the menu and the ones I ve experienced have turned out delicious This place is almost always busy so the bartenders are pretty busy Good luck getting a seat If you manage to get a seat while you wait for drinks it s a good idea to get some snacks to enjoy the chips dip is excellent 
-Ot017iM54hObZY5xZGk6g CMU I went here for restaurant week I was very impressed by the food The decor is also super cute Yum 
-ot3a-SxinexzVptFmIl3w CMU First off thank you Henrietta s Table for having a vegan option for restaurant week I love restaurant week but as a vegan it s so limiting as to which places I can go So I was super excited to see an option this year yay We went on Tuesday night my first time ever to this place Thankfully I had made reservations for 2 at 7 30pm otherwise who knows when we would have been seated there was a line and all the tables were being used We were seated immediately upon arrival Bread basket yum Love the variety of 3 breads that cranberry nut bread is delicious They serve it with a side of butter as usual Sometimes at nicer restaurants when I tell them I m vegan when I order they bring me out olive oil to use for the bread but our waitress didn t pick up on that No big deal just not giving them an above and beyond star Salads I got the spinach salad with nuts and mandarin oranges minus the cheese with the maple dressing Yummy My boyfriend got a salad with roasted tomatoes and prosciutto He enjoyed his a lot I got 2 glasses of wine throughout the night since it was restaurant week all glasses are 1 off awesome I choose to go local and drank the Rhode Island wine which was decent and cheap Boyfriend got a coke Entrees Boyfriend got the pork with a side of mash potatoes he liked it a lot I got the vegan option which is the same as the vegetarian option for restaurant week which was roasted veggies and quinoa with a side of brussel sprouts The brussel sprouts were great and come with olive oil not butter The roasted veggies with quinoa was OK I mean flavor wise it was great and again I am appreciative that I could even eat there But for a place like this I expected a better presentation It looked kind of sad All the little chopped up veggies looked like someone had just opened up a microwave bag of veggies and put them on my plate The presentation or idea could have been better for sure Desserts Boyfriend got the maple cheesecake and liked it a lot I got the sorbet and picked the chocolate yum and citrus sorbet It was good and a nice presentation Even though it was restaurant week we still spent over 100 but I am glad we finally got to experience dinner here I loved the open kitchen and the lighting and how all the tables are in the same room and it s very open But the acoustics were bad it s really loud there and hard to hear Gift shop is cute 
-owx1Yd4yYtzYNAEcsZFRA CMU The lackluster yelp reviews almost made us stop going in but on a Sunday night at 7 30 pm in Kendall Square nothing else was open We re glad we tried it We can t quite understand the negative reviews The ingredient combinations we tried of the two pizzas we got carry out were really good Both were blackboard specials The first one was chorizo with dill pickles a surprisingly good combination while the second was a smoked salmon with creme fraiche and caper pizza My favorite was the smoked salmon so yummy The pizzas were a wee bit oiler than I would like perhaps because of our ingredient choices so deducting one star for that but if we were staying in Cambridge longer would make this one of our take out places 
-phMx23hz4OYmyL6EPpxkw CMU UGH I really wanted to like this place but it fell short way short So we were dying to eat here as we had heard great things about this place The only AMAZING thing about it was my cocktail which was called the Battle of Trafalgar and it was awesome The waitress told me that they are known for this drink and have won awards for it and yes it was awesome The food was not so awesome We decided to order a few of the small plates so that we could try a variety of dishes We ordered the Jonah Crab Cakes very small portion tons of mayo which overpowered the actual crab meat so all in all very disappointing Short Rib Wellington this was definitely not a short rib wellington it was more like short rib stew with a topping of pastry puff The pastry puff was dry and the short rib stew was very watery again disappointed House Charcuterie Board ugh bread that came with it was dry no mustard provided the duck ham was sliced ridiculously thin and there were about three tiny slices of it the chicken liver pate was good but I have had better basically this does not even compare to Ten Tables charcuterie plate which is plentiful with tons of extras we then ordered the Smoked Lamb Belly Toast not kidding there was no lamb belly on the toast and this was just doused in butter and really terrible I would have returned it but by that point the disappointment and disgust was overwhelming the final thing we ordered was the Crispy Soft Poached Chip In Farm Egg this was AWESOME very different filled with flavor and my husband wanted another one definitely worth ordering All in all I would come back here for a drink but not the food It is very overpriced for the quality of food that you get So disappointing 
-PNNEyu0dnMawfsfqMks5g CMU Was visiting a homesick friend in boston one weekend and i think he took me here to insure i would keep coming back to boston for visits i love places that encourages taking youre time the meal was delicious perfect for summertime when you just cant decide what you want to eat the setting was beautiful and totally charming cant wait to come back he s won this one 
-Pu6aTTVWmhjDpvjWmwC_w CMU Went on Saturday night with a party of 6 for dinner Great ambiance and smooth service The cocktails were creative and came out fast We shared apps of oysters on the half shell lamb ribs and Gouda fries All perfect Entrees looked great and tasted better I had the pork 3 ways with polenta and my partner had the duck Sticky toffee pudding ended a perfect meal Whatever rough spots they may have had when they opened certainly have been addressed We ll be back 
-qaiFtkN9ZzAoVLFiwK39A CMU Highlight Watching a 12 year old approach the grill with a bowl filled with corn kernels and raw bacon Lowlight Trying to eat enough to make up for the 17 price tag I think the spiced tuna has the biggest price per pound on the buffet Strange conclusion I really want to go back I keep thinking of new exciting things to do with corn and bacon 
-qBIZK31ZZ6edlrrCjxswA CMU I ordered off the 50 menu includes an appetizer entree dessert and wine pairing with each course and my boyfriend had the spring rolls and Duck Duck Goose The food was great delicious ingredients combined with a creative flair Unfortunately the wait service was so horrible that my boyfriend and I spent more time bewildered by the treatment we were receiving than savoring our meals We were seated by the waitress stand ie where they enter their orders and collect silverware napkins Seating has never been an issue before as we are a laid back couple with usually nothing to complain about but our waitress spent the whole time gathering supplies while taking our order I think I only saw her face once She brought my wine late with each course and never told me what I was drinking Although she attempted to be friendly when speaking with us she was so rushed that I had the impression we were nothing but a bother to her My boyfriend had to request silverware from separate wait staff whenever our food arrived and he had to flag our waitress down for a second beverage after waiting for over 15 minutes for her to stop by It s too bad that the service was so horrible because as gathered from reading the other reviews we could have had a great time This was our worst dining experience in Boston to date 
-Qc1ZYesX5h-4tiGTqNSdA CMU This place has great potential and is in a great location but they still have a lot of room to grow I went here on a Thursday night around 7pm with a big group of college friends The wait staff seemed overwhelmed by our group and was not crazy about giving us a table in the dining room Some of us wanted to eat dinner some didn t I totally understand and wanted to make sure the waitress got a fair tip at the end Although the service was fine the waitress was pretty rude and annoyed the entire time Also the food was wayyy overpriced and not that good Her attitude made us uncomfortable so we all quickly ate our dinners and moved back over to the bar The restaurant was not crowded at all so I m not sure why this girl was in such a hot rush to get rid of us But whatever We moved back to the bar which by the way is a very small area Their dining room takes up about 75 of the space and the bar takes up the other 25 The space is so small that everyone was trickling into the dining area This obviously made the on edge hostesses very angry and they kept reminding everyone to stay inside the bar parameters I m sorry we re giving you business right If we bother you so much then maybe we can just go somewhere else o k Overall it was a sub par experience There are too many good bars and restaurants in Cambridge to waste my time and hard earned dollars at this place 
-qcZza5lP-c-CyfsISbcuw CMU Finale tries hard to be a European cafe and bakery Nice try bad execution Even though the little cakes are good the last two times I went with friends I was disappointed This is unfortunately consistent 1 Coffee served lukewarm 2 Salad leaves old and brownish 3 Service slow unfriendly leaving tables uncleared 4 Interior ok but why do you need to put ugly promotion stickers on your windows Finale wants to be too many things to too many people If that continues to be the non concept it s gonna be a quick Finale Good luck 
-qDMCp-I9mSkYh5YquNrgg CMU Food is not outstanding But is very consistent 
-QDQ5yyTxoGpFVqWUQpm3w CMU I ve been here a good handful of times now and found their previous menu to be an absolute steal The ambiance of this restaurant leaves something to be desired but it is still a perfectly nice place to have dinner with some friends Service can be shaky at times but they do aim to please As another yelper mentioned they recently updated their menu and pricing From what we were told on our last visit they were actually losing a lot of money with the previous pricing structure The prices have jumped a lot I ordered the beef tenderloin for 22 Friends ordered the pizza for 7 which is an app but worked very well as a dinner Most of the prices range in between those two amounts I feel bad the staff is taking a lot of heat for the change that they really had nothing to do with We were all happy with the quality of the food and the attention we received from the staff there 
-qlMyO4etK4Mxpomnzc3mg CMU I used to love this place but it s lost it luster over the years The concept is what originally drew me in I could pick out the meat veggies and sauce for my dish That was an almost foolproof guarantee that I will like my food right Eh not so much Even if you can pick the ingredients you still can t pick how it is cooked Major props to the guys who work the grill and have to keep everything in check but that is where everything starts to go downhill First of all my meat is always overcooked To the point where it is tough to chew Because of how long my meat is sitting on the grill my veggies and noodles also get charred in the process Also did you really just use the same spatula to cook everyone s food No wonder why my teriyaki sauce tastes like it is mixed with curry sauce some person before me had curry as their sauce and I m sure the person after me has my teriyaki sauce remnants all over their food as well Also when it gets REALLY busy and the poor cooks have like 30 things cooking at once good luck getting your food in a timely manner I spend about 10 minutes standing for each minute of actual eating Not a very good ratio IMO Also beware of their really big fishbowl giant margarita glass drinks It is about 90 ice and as a result the libation is seriously watered down However even the watered down version will knock you on your ass So keep that in mind the next time you think you can drink a whole one by yourself 
-Qt_dsLeDVuza-JgTPJqqQ CMU Thanks to my Yelp friend Melissa M I discovered this wonderful world of delicious fast food I ve only tried the veggie burgers and french fries and their homemade lemonade but they are SO GOOD I normally don t get to go to Harvard Square for lunch sadly and am also on a diet So I can only come here on my Saturday cheat days now on my non cheat days I daydream about those yummy veggie burgers and fries I gotta get myself over there on a Saturday soon 
-qX8PCA-hdpgojdGMrDSDg CMU Rendesvouz occupies a former Burger King spot which is oddly apparent the moment you enter see the sloped glass ceiling at the front of the dining room and the open kitchen at the back While they ve spruced the place up with low lighting and a rich paint job it still has a bit of an odd quick serve restaurant feel they should really rethink the view through kitchen idea because that adds to it Design oddities aside the menu service and food were superb We started off with a crisp bottle of L Ecole Semillon and a few slices of fresh country bread just like they serve in France crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside In fact the little French touches like the linen dish towel napkins almost made me forget we were dining at the former BK Lounge But then the real food arrived and this is no burger joint Thanks to the prix fixe special they were running I was talked into a 3 course feast starting with a delicious summer salad thin cucumber slices black olives tomatos feta and lots of mint then moving to a roasted chicken breast with green beans and new potatoes and wrapping up with a fluffy lemony pudding concoction My dining companion started with a tuna ceviche moved on to haddock in a basil pesto olive broth and finished with an orange polenta cake with berries The prices were reasonable and each course was absolutely delicious Our server was also great she was super attentive and knew the menu and recipes inside out Rendevouz s website is also pretty interesting it s a blog On it they provide standard restuarant site fare location hours reservation info etc plus the wine list recipes and info on creators of the art work currently gracing their walls But because it s a blog management can easily update the content as menus or artwork changes and patrons can easily leave comments Although the navigation is wonky on the secondary pages and the restaurant name is conspicuously absent from the header it s kind of a nice approach 
-rHwnEsdozf5894oV-J5jQ CMU My fiance and I were in Harvard for the day and were looking to grab some lunch and cocktails We came across Russell House Tavern and decided to give it a shot We walked in to find only two patrons in the entire restaurant and they were sitting at the bar We asked the hostess for a table for two to which she responded For what My fiance responded some drinks and maybe some food she then berated us and decided to speak to he and I as though we were children She said that the tables were only for those who wished to eat food and that if we decided to sit at a table we would be encouraged to have something to eat as only patrons eating were allowed to sit at the tables There was NO ONE in the restaurant We had every intention of eating there but this woman s attitude was just too much We finally did sit at a table and quickly realized the reason she was pushing the food it s because their menu is TERRIBLE We walked out quickly after we saw our poor food options I do not recommend this restaurant if the food looked even remotely appetizing we gladly would have stayed but due to poor atmosphere and waitstaff we made the proper decision and brought our business across the street to a lovely restaurant called Tory Row Having been in the restaurant business I know the appropriate way to greet and seat guests and this woman was the polar opposite of the correct way to do her job Do not waste your time with this place unless you like to be treated like garbage 
-RKf3Y0PYUPTN6AWDpV6kw CMU Tr ta has become one of my favorite places for dinner in Cambridge Food quality is consistently high and there is a nice selection of local New England beers on tap which makes me happy This weekend we enjoyed entrees from the specials menu a risotto w salmon haddock and a salmon salad Both were prepared well tasty and satisfying Regular menu offerings are familiar but better than pub grub or American chain restaurants I would not call it a pizza place though reviewers sing praises of their brick oven pizzas Nor is it an Irish pub in the usual sense despite the Irish name Tr ta and the comforting lilt you may hear on the tongues of restaurant staff and regulars at the bar Tr ta Kitchen Bar is indeed the best definition I love that Tr ta is fairly quiet so I can enjoy conversation without shouting though I have seen it crowded once or twice The vibe feels like a warmly decorated neighborhood hang and not as much a destination for chatty young college students the bar hopping social set or throngs of tourists or maybe I m just here on the early side In any case I hope Tr ta stays just as it is for many years to come 
-RQonzDENNng8tXzukUUww CMU A quick business lunch very tasty crab and corn soup plus a mighty fine ham sandwich A total winner 
-sZODS10ZxhYsXNZ-Eoy4A CMU We came here today and I was very impressed I m a bit skeptical when it comes to chain restaurants but the service was good the food was good and we got a table straight away The only thing holding me back from giving a 5 is that my appetizer was well tiny to say the least Almost needed a microscope to see it The meal was tasty and filling without leaving that sickly bloated feeling I m a bit of a sweet tooth so I made sure I had room for dessert I had the red velvet cheesecake which was amazing comparable to the Cheesecake Factory 
-TCTn0mwl_3VcD9Koh_yAA CMU There is very little to fault PARK on After a few visits I think it is my new go to in Harvard Square First the cheese spread is amazing It comes out with these great crackers that are light and airy So much better than plain old bread and butter My favorite app was the crispy mussels with preserved lemon were phenomenal and came in the cutest presentation The brisket the steak the salmon the scallops all were amazing Everything is always cooked perfectly The cocktails are inventive and delicious The servers are knowledgeable and timely Park is also really comfortable No loud music although the music is good comfy seating servers that don t rush you out The only place to fault PARK is the dessert The pie filling was great the crust was rock hard and flavorless Amp up the pie and you are a 5 star joint 
-TfG7pWiN7hq29PlWbaK9g CMU I took my wife here for her birthday She said the duck is very well known here and she wanted to try it She told me I had to reserve the duck when making the reservation When we sat down the waitress came over to tell us that the duck on the menu is not longer available I panicked and remember that I reserved the duck when making the appointment She went to check her reservation list and came back and said my duck is waiting for me in the kitchen The wait for the duck is long 1hr later it finally came out It looks stunning Everyone in the restaurant stared at the duck when it came out of the kitchen It truely is delicious My wife was very amazed that there was very little bones on the duck I wasn t a big fan of the dessert or appetizer 
-tP__hSRhbffpcUiLCn38Q CMU 5 of us went here for dinner on 6 18 11 The food was all fresh and anything one of us didn t like was all on us as we picked out the meats pastas veggies and sauces The grill did an alright job cooking everything my steak was a bit overdone for my liking but not horrible The waitress was slow and inattentive We had to track her down for drinks and the dessert menu My biggest complaint was the cleanliness of the place or rather the lack of cleanliness While food stations and dishes all appeared clean the amount of I am assuming spills that do not get taken care of was ridiculous Our feet stuck to the floor no matter where we stood or walked The counter around the grill was covered in a sticky mess all the way around and our table was sticky as well My guess is that there were a few slobs that spilled and rather than clean up the spills they were just getting spread aound with damp dirty mops and rags No matter how clean it might have been there the fact that I almost lost a sandal to the goo when waiting for my food to finish cooking was enough to turn me off of future visits If we were to try this place again it would be in the afternoon and hopefully not covered in sticky stuff yet 
-URDpFuU9-9iD-T3DLd_HA CMU I waited to write a review until I completed my own personal Triple Crown Treble Tricycle at this restaurant 1 brunch 2 dinner and 3 the burger at the bar The summary of this review is CoM is a spectacular restaurant The passion for their food permeates through all of the staff I find its casual upscale vibe very appealing My basis is limited mostly restaurants in Chicago and Boston but this place is my gold standard for restaurant excellence What s amazing is I ve dined here over a handful of times and I remember everything I ve eaten from the rotating seasonal menu except for maybe the desserts I m not much of a dessert guy Notable standouts include olive oil poached halibut over beets the best fish dish I ve ever had pork three ways and grilled octopus with citrus flavors an appetizer I also recommend getting the bone marrow as a side to share The first time I dined here was for brunch with my now fianc We started playing a game to see if our glasses of water would ever go beyond half empty it was a warm summer day They never did Needless to say we left well hydrated and were impressed by the attentive service For brunch I usually look for something with a poached egg and the donut and the hot chocolate containing flavors I ve never experience before are worthy additions My most recent visit here was to try the heralded burger My fianc and I arrived 30 min early on a Saturday to make sure we would be seated at the bar We ended up being the first ones served the burger that night I ordered the burger medium rare with bacon In short the burger is perfect and I wouldn t change a thing It is beyond me how it is so juicy The flavor of the bone marrow that is added to the patty really comes through I really like their house made ketchup conventional ketchup I find too sweet and the potato wedges are a great compliment to the burger My final note is half the times I ve dined here I ve been served by the older gentleman I have to admit I initially thought he was a little brusque I also tend to mispronounce the French terms on the menu which elicited a look from him as if he s saying are you sure you can handle the level of food you will be eating But like any good server he is attentive and politely answers any questions He ends up being the perfect server for enjoying this restaurant In short a terrific restaurant and one that I look forward to each time I visit 
-v6rbdwh_zoYxtGp8rrwwA CMU Others have written about the exquisite food so I will write instead about the service because my experience was so remarkable on a rainy awful night that I have tears in my eyes thinking about it Having misunderstood an invitation i arrived TWO HOURS early cold wet embarrassed miserable EVERY SINGLE PERSON on the Bondir staff went out of her his way to make me feel comfortable as I sat in the tiny antechamber waiting i had strength only to order an aperitif but they brought me bread and a bowl of hot soup and directed me to a tiny library of cookery books to while away my time They would not let me pay for anything and because I had a patch on one eye and no depth perception they guided me to the bathroom When it was time to leave one server Kathleen came with an umbrella to escort me to a car that was waiting for me If you are old and a bit ditzy and people are unfailingly kind to you you will have an idea of my experience at Bondir I praise not just the gorgeous food and lovely accoutrements but the perfect humanity of the place 
-V7TNA3qwGZT2KRyIE3Htw CMU The fried fish patty sucks 
-VPqH1L90GlEe4jOPMaIBA CMU I took my husband here for his birthday last night We did the 10 course tasting which was excellent The waitstaff was wonderful and our server in particular Johnathan was very helpful and informative He made great suggestions for wine and made sure to ask us about our preferences for the tasting The food was excellent and the environment was unpretentious I tasted some foods which I never would have tried and ended up liking everything The most adventurous thing we had was the veal sweetbread I don t typically eat beef but it was prepared very well and it was my husband s favorite dish We were at the restaurant for almost 5 hours but we could have done it in about half the time if we wanted to My suggestion would be to save some money and splurge for one of the tasting menus We did spend a lot of money especially since we got 2 bottles of wine and 2 dessert drinks but it was worth it for a special occasion I would definitely recommend going here for the tasting menu at least once for the experience 
-Vrjs505K6lN7sQYByd75g CMU update they are no longer offering their happy hour deal 
-WbLTDS96GS-RUaA_QiBWQ CMU In short burgers are tasty but the fries suck If you re in a pinch and need a quick bite sure stop in but be warned the fries suck 
-wq0CBDTRBALekHS5ym_JA CMU I came here for dinner and dessert with a friend on a week night The staff was very attentive We sat right away and ordered our food The menu is pretty expensive for the portion size but that s just the way this place is quality not quantity The quality of the food here was high in my opinion I had the mac and cheese and it was excellent Rich and warm I was full before I even got dessert but I was obviously not leaving without it I had the layered mousse and it was also very good I felt that the sorbet that came with it was a bit mismatched I would have preferred a raspberry sauce or glaze but the apricot sauce that was there was good The place seems to be set up in a lounge style but they had music playing much too loudly to really feel like a lounge It also loses points because parking in Harvard Square is impossible Just saying if I had the choice between this place and an equivalent with it s own parking lot I d go with the latter Overall I really enjoyed my meal here I m sure I ll be back 
-WQuFi-kv71Ek4Jw-I3Oog CMU Top 5 reasons why the burgers at Firebrand Aint worth 18 1 The Misses waited for 5 minutes she claims 10 but benefiting the doubt at the door without any attention Granted she had her hair in a bun that day I keep warning her about that bun Doesn t do her good 2 I watched my order sit at the pass under the heat lamp for 5 minutes probably more like three minutes but I get some bonus minutes from above before the Chef and owner rolled by to toss some garnish on my food and let it sit their even longer Finally made eyes with the line cook who brought it over Also watched as the raw oysters sat under the heat lamp Front of house despicable 3 The burgers are literally served with NOTHING on the side No side salad that would cost them 30 cents to make No fries No chips Not even a smile 4 Their idea of decor are a few hanging Streetglow kits and a streaming Powerpoint presentation 5 Because you probably worked for that 18 Head the other way to Miracle of Science And the top 3 reasons investors should cut their losses and bail 1 Your chef and owner wanders around aimlessly neither adding any value to the front or back of house while managing to stick his grubby fingers in your food Better make friends with the health inspector 2 Kendall square has about 10 new establishments from Catalyst to Abigails What differentiates Firebrand Aints other than overpriced burgers 3 Your marketing is laughable You could have found a hundred people at MIT to build you a better website overnight for a pack of Red Bull and a mint Darth Vader action figure Wake up and pull the wool off your eyes I love Kendall Square and I want dearly to see it vitalized It s also the exact reason why I want losers like Firebrand Aints to go somewhere else Keep my hard earned 50 I ll be the one laughing when you re all out a mil MIT you could have done better Harvard gets Chef Ferran Adri you get Chef Nobody from Central Kitchen Irate Oh and a note to Bryce the cook chef who tried to make it all better You re better than this You re a young guy with a reputation to build In one year you ll have nothing to show for yourself except tenure at a no name failed establishment in Cambridge 
-wtUBRHkhSjRHs0AAEGPHA CMU This place is amaaaaaazing Yelp should let me give this place an entire galaxy of stars to rate it I ve been here twice now once for birthday dinner at the bar another time for Sunday brunch at a table like a civilized person and both times were mind blowing The food is seriously the best out there service is impeccable and ambiance is superb The best part You can order anything off any menu and it is guaranteed to be the best that they can give you Tony Maws and his awesome team know their way around a kitchen and this girl s tummy for sure It doesn t hurt that the bartenders know their way around cocktails equally as well Well that part might hurt the next day if you re not careful But knowing you had a fantastic meal should more than make up for it 
-XAkn0mEubwp_S_ifprfAQ CMU I went for the burger Amazing It opens at 530PM and we show up at 525PM and there were 7 people in line ahead of us Crazy right Everyone goes straight to the bar area since everyone is there for the same thing Cragie on Main s infamous burger We order that as well as a side of Bone Marrow with fresh bread which I found quite gross but the other guys I was with found it amazing The burger on the other hand was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing I would say it was in my top two or 3 burgers ever with Farmstead in Providence and Kooper s Tavern in Baltimore The bartender and service was also amazing Very attentive and we had amazing liquor drinks made for us I would recommend this place to anyone for a classy burger or a fancy but expensive meal 
-xeHAuRqWBiIAFrLrjltOA CMU Our hotel s receptionist sent us here because she has been coming here for 25 years She must have really bad taste glens Their food selection is very small some of the food was not even fresh Their salmon tasted spoiled even after it was cooked Why are they still in business Why do people come here to torture themselves This place is not even sanitary with the way they keep and cook their food 
-xNk5LWExYnqNxpmtNQZyw CMU i came in here one evening already full of delicious libations to meet up with a young gent Located in the middle of Harvard Square twas convenient While dark and rather quiet although it was a Tuesday Noir s got class with its own modification The crowd for lack of a better word there was certainly made of various individuals None of which seemed to be of a certain type which in my opinion was great that there was such differences in one location They do have an open patio which we didn t get to sit on because it was already past the hour However I did get to enjoy sitting in a Frank Sinatra like booth and enjoyed the company I was in over light conversation without overly bearing music blaring or college kids screaming at each other It was nice to not be in the hustle and bustle While enjoying their atmosphere my drink on the other hand could have used a few extra pours but that could again also be the fact that I ve been drinking for awhile and just needed more 
-XRUq_3WIUihQ8Ygfit5Vw CMU Not too long ago there was an article or was it a review that I enjoyed reading that named a certain establishment as the author s local defining local as a pub near one s home where you can stumble from drunk a place where they know you Because you are there A lot This undoubtedly makes Russell House Tavern my local And for that I am thankful I ve stumbled in stumbled out tried nearly everything on the menu sipped wine from the tap beer from the bottle knocked back more Fernet than I should admit met up with friends ran into some more sat at the upstairs bar with the windows open sat downstairs in the lounge and even brunched on the patio It s just one of those places where you can do all of those things and they are all so well done Points that separate Russell House from the pack The editing process of their bar for starters There s hardly anything more exciting than the opportunity to be introduced to a new beer wine spirit of which I was previously unfamiliar Nope you just won t find the same old selection here And if that s what you re looking for then there s plenty of other bars to hit up in Boston If you re curious ask about their wine on tap their extensive craft beer selection or their scotch list For lunch dinner brunch or late night snacks the Russell House menu features dishes in a wide range of proteins flavors and price points You ll find pizzas are big enough to share while small plates are perfectly sized to enjoy 2 3 per person Traditional entrees range from 10 28 and you d be a fool not to find something to love lamb shank an Ozark pork trio belly shoulder and loin two steaks and a really bad ass burger served on an English muffin The fries with their crispy salty perfection of texture make it hard for me to eat them any where else Among my favorites the egg the charcuterie and the pork trio Whether at the bar or a table I ve found the service to be pretty on point with the food generally arriving in the right amount of time the staff smiling and helpful and water glasses shot glasses beer glasses and cocktails are always full And despite the busy summer season getting a seat here is a relatively smooth and swift process The only night I absolutely couldn t get a table was during Harvard graduation Fair enough A melding of creative well priced food a welcoming and warm atmosphere the decor improvements from the previous inhabitant are tremendous finely crafted cocktails and a beer and wine list that will both educate and satisfy you Russell House is the piece that s been missing from Harvard Square a bar lounge restaurant that lacks pretension caters to the curious with being too obscure and never fails to make for me a difficult time of narrowing down just what exactly I am going to eat and drink each time I go 
-XRymI8KvwqhX6R_uzRsqQ CMU We were blessed with gorgeous Boston weather for our al fresco lunch at Upstairs On the Square Everything on the menu seemed to call out to me but I absolutely could not get enough of the simple bibb lettuce with radishes grapefruit and green goddess dressing I ate every single bite of that refreshing pile o greens I rarely finish full portions of anything Regrettably after my grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup there was no room for dessert This was especially sad given how tantalizing the seasonal selection of sorbet appeared 
-xx74FnBn2XEle7WvKfZjQ CMU Awesome place When you walk in it almost looks more like they cast their customers instead of people walking in randomly Very cool crowd the prices are dirt cheap 8 9 a plate The food was very good and the staff is super friendly Only down side the bacon tasted like a mixture of throw up and dirt No lo recomiendo I got eggs Benedict one of the things I miss the most since being a vegetarian wanna be vegan It was very satisfying I don t know if meat eaters would be able to compare it to real eggs but if you have an open mind this thing tasted pretty good Somebody I was with had a really long hair in their food and the employee immediately took it away and offered a new one Without having even asked when she brought the check it was removed from our bill She was very nice the entire time and the service was pretty fast for it being super packed in there We probably waiter about 20 minutes This place was awesome is all I can say maybe its called veggie galaxy because they really are aliens conspiracy theory maybe but really I didn t think humans could still be so competent and friendly at the same time 
-YhvdlQwMktmMwFAyUZv5w CMU After a fun filled night of karoke near BU we wanted to cruise back over to Harvard for a night cap Since we are Virginians the cold got the best of us and we agreed to go to the first bar that we saw We spotted Russell House across the street and noticed on their sign that they have 1 oysters from 11 midnight yes 11 12 pm The whisky and beer selection was extensive and descently priced I ordered the Belgian Abbey Ale beware this is a heavy one but full bodied and 9 4 We also ordered 2 dozen oysters They came from somewhere on the west coast so they were small but tasted good It was a bit of a teaser you can t win em all To top it off our waitress Karen was super nice and helpful Thanks Russell House for a good time 
-YsT0nBqilLn_GQQSPkdew CMU For New American fare they remind me a lot of Les Quinze Nits and 4 Gats in Barcelona The food is excellent but the decor is not as appealing It would be nice if they provided different seating zones for those who prefer a less ornate environment Though I recommend the dining experience 
-zaDVTu_wq5M56gdZlr4vg CMU The drinks are amazing old school drink menu tons of options Free hard boiled eggs at the bar Friendly and nice waiters and bar staff Excellent food Simple basic American style food Roasted chicken the salad with candied walnuts pears and blue cheese could be the only salad I eat for the rest of my life and I d die happy It s my favorite for dinner or drinks and I wish I could go more often 
-ZlI5EiAE3BFz8FyhpZcDA CMU Delicious food and great service I can t tell what kind of atmosphere this is though formal classy casual I saw people wearing all different kinds of clothes from super casual to date night formal Either way I don t think they care This was my 2nd time trying this type of New American food Sometimes the actual food and the ingredients don t really sound good to me but once everything is all together the flavors blend SO WELL It s like a party in my mouth of delicious spices and ingredients that I never would have liked if I ate them by myself And I actually didn t like them individually when I picked apart the salads and side dishes All their tables are copper or copper esque material It s a pretty small restaurant and they have a decently sized bar There are no house lights but since we were there when the sun was still out the lighting wasn t too bad I d imagine it being pretty dark though if it was night outside First off their white bean spread for their complimentary rustic bread is very unique and yummy It s not as thick as hummus but it kinda seems like white bean blended with yogurt or something I just hope it didn t have loads of butter cause otherwise I would ve definitely had clogged arteries after how much of that I ate Wild mushroom pate Looks a little weird like spreaded white mush but combined with the bread and pickled mushrooms and salad YUM Filet mignon tartare not my cup of tea but my brother loves this stuff They put a lot of onions and spices in the tartare and an optional quail egg on top I only enjoyed it with the bread because it was too much for me alone Sardine special this was probably my favorite I ve never seen sardines so big and tasted so flavorful It was slightly charred on the outside which gave it a good crisp Monkfish Etouffe pretty spicy so don t get this if you can t handle I liked the consistency of the grilled monkfish but it was underseasoned so you had to eat it with the sauce Pretty good overall though 
-ZM-UC303_LiBGVfa9aB3w CMU I actually think this place could be kind of good But it s less than average I don t know if the menu changes during lunch or what but I went there for dinner with my friend and we were well surprised disappointed with the 1 page food menu and 5 pages of drinks and to add to that the food menu was really expensive for a place that looks like an old diner off the side of the road 13 for a chicken BLT 20 25 for entrees that didnt even look that good The music isn t as loud as everyone says but it could have been a good night when we were there I like the colors and the deco feel to it and the layout and the waitstaff is friendly The menu needs to be changed Until then I probably won t go back there 
-_anQt4beVDv_bELU69VLg CMU They have oysters and their bar manager is Aaron formerly of Drink Try his housemade spiced rum And a great beer list what more could you ask for I haven t tried any of their food so can t comment on that Go at off hours like 2pm 
-_aZPa_loeijR82b6BFb4Q CMU We came here for my mother s birthday a few weeks ago Dad easily got reservations for dinner on a Tuesday but seeing how busy it was when we arrived I m glad he got them I love how everything is actually local as in you can see exactly where they got each piece of the menu Locavores and lovers of fine cuisine will be thrilled Started out with butternut squash soup with ancho chili oil maple butter and toasted pumpkin seeds Wow The chilies added just enough bite to keep me interested The soup was creamy but not too heavy I dipped some bread Iggy s into it which was heaven I got the bluefish entree and it was divine It had been a long time since I d eaten bluefish but it was perfectly cooked served over roasted peppers and other veggies it was meant to come with a pear relish or something like that but I m not a pear fan so I asked for no pear We rounded out the evening with dessert parsnip cake did not try and flourless chocolate cake I wish my cake had more raspberry sauce and less whipped cream but the chocolate part was divine The service was impeccable Our waitress was patient with our lagging in order Dad likes to take his time and our accidental Tuesday night tipsiness She knew the menu and was attentive but not overbearing Glad I tried EVOO I work in Kendall so next on the list is definitely Za 
-_NwWZ8EyHNRaTYo4J6ayQ CMU Oh the late nights I ve spent at Noir My one complaint about Noir is they ve usually long stopped serving food by the time I show up in the wee hours They re open till 2 they ve got a good bourbon selection the cocktails are excellent and Alice will give you a great neck massage if you ask nicely and sometimes even if you don t The patio s fantastic in the summer and hell in the spring and fall too When you see all the neighborhood bartenders show up at the same place when their shifts are done you know you ve chosen the right bar 
-_SMCbridl-mGumUNn0jgw CMU I think it took me 6 years before I started visiting this place regularly I was prompted to find Noir when I was searching for a place to take an exboyfriend for one of those awkward state of my life without you conversations that we hadn t visited during the relationship Plus it s dark there which gave the meeting a stealthy vibe Anyway since then I ve been back to Noir a ton I never knew about the happy hour menu All the sandwiches are 4 dollars instead of 8 and you can get a big warm cookie for a dollar And a wasabi pea mix for only a few bucks My favorite time to visit Noir is in the summer when one can feel all Euro by sitting on the patio No one has to know you only paid 6 dollars for your meal Of course drinks are not on sale but a place that will feed me and provide a full cocktail for 20 bucks has got my stars Finally the waitstaff is incredibly friendly The gregarious bartender always lets me sit where I want and she even sneaks me the happy hour menu even when I show up just moments before 9pm Happy hour ends at 9 and I believe it begins at 6 Good music too I ve heard the Cure there ps They showed Madmen on Sunday nights last summer on the large projector One time the projector didn t work which was frustrating but then we got a free round Good times 
006mKbQzuQkSRz9JNAYDqg CMU Overall I enjoyed Russell House Tavern The service was very good the wine was excellent and it s a comfortable conveniently located venue The reason I gave it 3 stars rather than 4 was because I had quite a mediocre meal For an entree I got the Berkshire Blue Cheese Wedge salad which was listed on the menu as coming with blue cheese pears grilled onions and crispy pig s ear But you could barely detect anything other than lettuce in the salad I got I literally got tiny specks about 1 4 the size of an M M of each add in For dessert I ordered the molten dark chocolate torte which was way too sweet and didn t have much chocolate flavor The only saving grace was that I then traded dessert with a friend and my new dessert carrot cake bread pudding was delicious I can only hope that this was an off night and not business as usual 
00MvQIKBfyw7aOI61itDjA CMU I wanted to be blown away by Salts but was a little underwhelmed Perhaps it was the addition of beets to the entire Winter menu that threw me off The food was wonderfully prepared and the service was incredible I just didn t leave thinking that Salts was the French inspired restaurant I was waiting for It was also filled with Boomers So that hurt its ratings a little 
00sD5qzwz9VcsbPG4nLNug CMU Best mac and cheese ever The leftovers really lost their creamy magic so I recommend arriving a little starved so you don t have anything left over My friend got the salmon and was equally thrilled Overall it has some relatively affordable but tasty options for a place with an upscale but relaxed atmosphere in Harvard Square 
01v3s-y5wP5wGiJB7Dji-w CMU A classic in Harvard Square usually full of Harvard students Overall a great quality and atmosphere for a very reasonable price The market fish is usually great the steak frites at night is also wonderful with a great aioli sauce Brunches are great as well and it s usually easier to get a table A little bit noisy but that s a part of the experience 
020BPBx6iEkSnWloMNzvcg CMU Brontosaurus hippie tasteless It s what we all think about when we think vegetarian god forbid vegan No longer Just had a Satan BLT sandwich whilst my blood thirsty boxing companions mowed down three other manlettes and frappamanchinos As one of them put it this omelette is like a burrito He then helped an elderly woman cross the street shotgunned a bottle of Jack Maniels and punched a hipster in the mouth Where else can you get a banana cream pie hold the aborted would have been chickiedoodlebabies A BLT made from the meat substitute of Beelzebub An adorable upside down cinnamon bun Suckerkick 
02eTNSx4Re8xuSumV3WLwg CMU I grew up with noodles and rice Not burgers and fries Not into weird cheese sauces Or something as a middle schooler that gave me a Post Dramatic Pasta Disorder Thought the mac n cheese here would cure me It was pretty good seashells and seashells of pasta Remembering it correctly I was just downing their bottle of wine while being very very hungry Mac n cheese melty and crusty Portions were very big as well as a bit pricey Dimmed lightings and comfy corners Great place for friends or significant others MMMmm 
02oqRFHRq30mN6WgPZL5jg CMU Noir seems like it would be exclusive and uptight like the hotel it s associated with but it s really a neighborhood hangout with a great cocktail menu Popular with the restaurant crowd since it s open til 2am Drop by on Fridays to meet up with a very friendly and mostly harmless Harvard admissions officer He ll give you his card Bonus best bathrooms of any bar in the Boston metro area 
03uTX0CeltymRGJzbbrWEg CMU BREAKFAST I get a little nervous about ordering oatmeal from restaurants because you never know if you re getting instant old fashioned steel cut whatever However the steel cut oats from Henrietta s Table served with maple syrup and mixed berries was PERFECT I m really not feeling the atmosphere at HT like someone else said it feels like a jazzed up version of Cracker Barrel I love Cracker Barrel but it just doesn t work with gourmet food HT is also somewhat cafeteria feeling My hash browns were good but really really oily There was no way anyone could eat more than a few bites and not feel incredibly sick have to sleep off a grease induced coma I appreciate they use local and organic ingredients and would like to visit for lunch dinner and update my review Until then three stars 
04DFXEu1T5sUFm3JSSuILA CMU As far as Harvard Sq goes this spot was good Like the look lights kind of hurt my eyes could have been super cool with larger artwork on the far wall and white christmas lights So outside of Decor We had fried calamari very good chicken sandwich also good and a stake mediocre at best the service was very attentive 
051gfSbguYdmoEtbSyzMxQ CMU Update I can t stop eating the mac n cheese with duck confit I was 163 lb last week now I am 187 I had never been to the Green Street We had just left The Miracle of Science and realized that the beer wasn t as filling as we thought The idea was initially to go to Oleana I really wanted to go there again but it was too late to squeeze five of us in so we chose the Green Street Grill I still don t get why we had to drive there from the Miracle but we did but I digress Upon entering I thought that I might be in for some real pub food Some burgers and fries and Black Label The facade just looks that way I was surprised to find a jewel inside They like Oleana were also full They unlike Oleana were able to squeeze us in We sat and had drinks within minutes and our food orders in We all ordered appetizers and were stoked to find out that they were borderline complete meals The food was extremely tasty and completely reasonable in price The service lacked nothing and the owners attention made us feel quite special From the drinks to the appetizers to the desserts this place rocks Now I just have to go back to eat the main courses I ll be there soon 
057Ny54RD5II4Nq0Kq4GKw CMU Remember when the Lonely Island said Mr Pibb Red Vines Crazy Delicious I have a new equation Pimm s No 1 St Germain Crazy Drinklicious The best thing in Russell House Tavern is its Battle of Trafalgar drink Add a little honey simple batavia arrack no idea what that is and honey simple and you have the perfect drink Not too sweet not too strong and not too pretentious it s just right Every friend who tries it likes it It should be called the Goldilocks drink But I guess Battle of Trafalgar is a more badass name Russell House also has great pizzas and fries but the Battle of Trafalgar is what keeps me coming back for more 
075WRDTsrw045k0e2rNWJg CMU On a Friday my husband and I made reservations within an hour of when we wanted to have dinner Walking in we really loved the space open and airy with an elegant but industrial feel We were seated the two of us at a long table that could accomodate 10 people here is where I got skeptical Having had a rough day I didn t feel like sitting picnic style with others for a nice dinner Looking around there were a lot of tables like this and I eventually I simmered down Still it would have been nice if we were given an option Okay and the acoustics are loud in there its hard to hear your date but if you wanted to accomodate a large group and have a rip roaring good time at least you know now that you can go to West Bridge and get a giant table and whoop it up On to the food We ordered one of the small plates the chef s signature egg in a jar which had amazing flavor The consistency was a little weird for me it was pudding like with the pureed potatoes but really delicious Oh before we ordered we asked for bread and got two small pieces along with a heaping mound of butter to dip it in Really Two pieces I was maybe at least expecting 4 pieces but it seems like they were really skimping on this so I wasn t impressed but whatever I guess it allowed me to save room for the main course Our waiter was a doll though He knew that our drinks were taking longer than usual and took one off our bill and he was quick to make sure we knew about the great specials they had that night as well as point out vegetarian options We ordered the Duck and the Char for our main courses and they were both amazing They more than made up for the lack of bread The flavors were really fantastic and well paired I would totally go back for the Char again really fabulous And then we waited forever for our waiter or someone to offer us more drinks or a dessert menu or something Eventually our waiter came by acknowledged the lack of service and comped us a nice dessert the carrot cake He was very apologetic about the service and we appreciated that This made us more likely to come back again to see how the place functions once some of the kinks are worked out Overall great food and good intentioned waitstaff 
08ELBYVL1QXBXORhxe8a7A CMU Upon perusing the Flat Patties reviews heretofore known as Flatties it seems that the overwhelming feeling is that the burgers are underwhelming and greasy I ll be honest I have not had a burger here What I have every single time I come here is the grilled chicken sandwich Flatties serves up a whole breast of chicken grilled with some spices I imagine it is salt pepper and a bit of something else Lettuce tomato and I add avacado Fresh avacado Yes this is a fast food joint But they have avacado YUM Top it off with some of their condiments fantastic relish jalapenos red onions PICKLES sliced thin YUM They have an array Since food is really just a vehicle for condiments go forth and top your sandwich burger fries Enjoy You can sit at the bar counter and watch the Flatties peeps cook your food fresh for you I like knowing that my food hasn t been sitting waiting for me for a long time The other thing which I think is fantastic is that they are constantly cleaning this place There has not been one occasion I can think of where I did not see at least one person scrubbing washing or drying something off OCD me loves cleanliness You should too Flatties is also cheap They even raised their prices in the recent past within the last year but I think the sandwich sans avacado is still under four bucks How can you beat that 
08KDkDGuvVTIkCIvGvX4OQ CMU I had breakfast there this morning such an amazing experience We had the most adorable server who was very helpful and accomodating I ordered tea which automatically came with honey which is a huge plus for me The waffles were amazing as were the omelets Definitely will be back to try either lunch or dinner 
08sjiSJMzcOxrHfsZJhNyQ CMU I am a bit young for the Grafton Street crowd and I m not a fan of the overall atmosphere slightly yuppie but not real yuppie aspirational yuppie if that makes any sense arg I haven t had a meal here lately but I remember it being pretty decent in the past if slightly expensive But it s going for the not poor college student crowd so I have been going to the bar lately The beer menu is decent they have some locals like smuttynose on tap for reasonable prices 5 50 I believe They also have 3 Narragansetts which is a good price I think but it feels awkward drinking one here just not the right vibe Bartenders are efficient and quick to serve I enjoy watching them handle the crowd and make ridiculous drinks If it s a crowded night in Harvard Square and you re looking for a place to find a seat and get a drink Grafton Street would be a decent option 
0aDD0d-f9NToq3NUWxzU0w CMU This is my new favorite place in Kendall Square great bar service and drinks for reasonable prices I have only had the Gouda fries and raw bar both were delicious Perfect date spot and place to hang with friends or family not the best place to watch a game because the TV s are almost hidden which isn t a bad thing sometimes Highly recommended 
0aMruNccBX8ZMRKg6ser7A CMU Been there for Restaurant Week the second time Unlike the first time around my latest experience was not too happy While the food was OK it was not inspiring enough for me to go there ever paying full price Especially off putting was the service While waiting for a table at the bar every single waiter bumped us around It felt more like being in the food court of Faneuil Hall At the table the staff kept rushing us removing plates while eating or shoving new dishes on the table creating an atmosphere of a airport bar Very sad indeed 
0apdmInglZzjxDiiqF6I4w CMU I love this place You really can t go wrong with anything on the menu My favorite thing about the restaurant is the Sunday brunch and I think it s worth the 45 price tag once you see how much food you can choose from it s insane However don t expect good service I ve been here a couple times not just on a Sunday and the service is never very good Expect the busser and food runner to be more attentive than you re actual server 
0b3OXVxsFR35oKgVYexiYg CMU 3 stars for the food It wasn t anything to write home about in fact I don t remember it at all We were there for brunch 1 disappointed star for the bloody mary disaster Let me paint you a picture of the bloody mary disaster I would have called it the bloody mary situation but that word has new meeting these days but I disgress disaster is more accurate anyway Okay so let s start with the price 9 WHAAAT you say 9 That should be a HUGE veggie laden bloody mary right F ing WRONG This was by far the worst bloody mary I have ever laid eyes on It was in one of those water wine glass things so what I would consider small if not very small Vodka tomato juice that s it Vodka tomato juice 9 Are you stoned That s ridiculous I hope someone reads this and either lowers the price to what it should be 3 or jazzes it up quite a bit and even if it was appropriately jazzed it needs to be bigger and cheaper A bloody really shouldn t be more than 7 Ugh this was a month ago and I m still annoyed by it Service we sat at the bar and the service was really weak I have high expectations when sitting at the bar because you re right there there s a lot of face time it should be simple No it was not It was not a pleasant experience all around 2 service stars 
0B9XfSP1mwkrD22n3m9sDA CMU I came here with some friends to enjoy a post 4 hr class meal My expectation were revved up which may account for why I didn t enjoy it as much as I should have That and the fact that I didn t get to try any of their great drinks Walking in I was immediately struck by the smell of something unpleasant somewhere between that wet dog smell and the smell of said dog s urine It was more a slight odor than a stench but it was still there When we were seated upstairs where it was a bit too warm for me I couldn t smell it anymore so no harm no foul I ordered the grilled steak which I enjoyed for the most part It was nice and tender and a very decent portion came with butter with a side of salad The extra yuca that I ordered was decent but I ve had better I was very tempted to try out one of their drinks but I couldn t because I had to wake up in five hours to go to work and alcohol was not a good idea at the time But I watched my friends take much delight in what they had and I m told that the Lion s Tail is excellent I m gonna try it next time I go Maybe I was a bit disenchanted because of the build up that my friends created It s certainly not a bad place at all the staff is friendly the food isn t bad and the ambiance is cozy if you don t mind the slight hint of wet dog urine but I expected a bit more I m pretty sure I ll be back to give this place more of a fair shake No expectations that sort of thing Besides I want me some Lion s Tail 
0b_BHsOb5sXEnybPOGdeVw CMU Atmosphere beautiful Service pretty bad we had to flag our waiter down multiple times One of our meals was the wrong dish and it took over 40 minutes to come back out at least we know it s fresh right Appetizers wonderful we have a spread and bread delicious the swamp bowl left much to be desired though the meat was old and the crawfish tasted like it died a year ago and was frozen and microwaved Entrees some were good others were okay Verdict I probably won t come back anytime soon but the risotto as a side was great 
0DvNC4pUfjENTyMQyqs-YA CMU My family from out of town and myself dined at this restaurant on 5 21 11 We had to wait about an hour for a table but that was fine as everyone was off looking around the nearby shops We had no idea this place was a gastropub so when we were seated and took a look at the menus we were kind of confused My family is from western new york and didn t even know what aioli was but the waitress was very helpful in explaining some of the dishes Even with the explanations we all stuck to the safe side of things no one would eat beef heart We started with the deviled eggs and the melted cambaloze cheese appetizer They were both delicious and highly recommended For entrees people had the grassfed burger which they seemed to enjoy the crabcakes which had a different consistency from crabcakes I ve had anywhere else but were good the chicken sandwich which I thought was delicious So all in all it was a very interesting and delicious meal I would definitely recommend the restaurant to anyone looking to try new types of food or foodies but if you wander in thinking it is a traditional tavern with the traditional fare you are out of luck 
0egTiTB0Nc8JXRYaRDnWmQ CMU Teeny tiny place but delicious burgers in a unique atmosphere Dirt cheap too 
0EJXPtO56S26f4ApUYPSUg CMU Good but overpriced and pretentious 
0ELSKfFQUmfmnH_wD9s79A CMU Last night I went to Craigie on Main for Chef s Whim It was my birthday I hadn t been feeling well all day but I was really looking forward to dinner By 930pm it seemed like I was on the mend When we were seated at the table there was a card from Craigie wishing me a Happy Birthday Our waiter and hostess knew everything about us based on casual questions my husband had asked or mentioned on the phone Both wished me a happy birthday upon arrival and our waiter let us know that he knew my husband was a pescetarian and he would talk to the chefs to accommodate They did gladly Again neither my birthday or my husband s diet were big points when making the reservation They just paid attention I ve worked in restaurants before so service is something that often disappoints me when going out to eat I have never felt so welcomed and taken care as I did last night When our first course arrived I felt instantly revitalized and felt like I was definitely feeling better 2nd course I still felt ok Right before the 3rd course I was feeling faint and began shaking I was picking at this delicious plate of monkfish with yuzu ginger and chickpeas and was worrying if I was going to be sick What to do I couldn t finish My husband called over the waiter to let him know that I d suddenly had a turn for the worse He was concerned stopped the courses and brought the hostess over They just wanted me to be happy they would do whatever we wanted Continue with the remaining three courses trim it down to 4 or we could possibly even come back the following Sunday I knew that if they brought out the 4th course I would not be able to eat it but I really didn t want to leave when we had been treated so wonderfully Unfortunately I had to admit that I could not go on They re booked us for this Sunday they only charged us for our drinks and continually made us feel that they just wanted the best for us I was nearly moved to tears This was the type of service that I dream about Kind knowledgeable unobtrusive elegant but welcoming and with obvious love for food and the experience of dining Without question the best dining experience I have ever had I cannot wait to finish my 6 courses this Sunday and I would recommend Craigie to anyone and everyone 
0Em78JicWhLUXDecRsosyQ CMU What s all the fuss with Russell House I came in for a solo lunch and had a pleasant enough experience I mean it s a gastro pub in Harvard Square a needed thing by all means but not sure if it s worth writing to Mom and Dad about Maybe I m wrong I dunno A few things that caught my attention as I sat at the upstairs bar for lunch on a Thursday afternoon on a warm August day There is a downstairs bar Huh I would have sat in these shady depths had I known that to be an option The sun hurts me Hurts I say Crab cakes are my enemy They look so good and I want them but they hurt me deeply Like literally every time I have them I suffer So why do I order them Russell House is no exception That s my fault for ordering but their fault for making them look so good on my neighbors plate Damn you both Excellent little beer list Loved the Bengali Tiger IPA on tap A perfect cold beer for a warm day Would have loved to have a few more but life was calling and I for once was listening Bar staff was nice enough Prompt Seemed to be mixing up some interesting drinks Made with the water Cleared the mess Charged the credit card Did not harass Interior is modern Clean A little too clean maybe I like a few stuffed deer heads on the walls View of pedestrian traffic in Harvard Square is both fun and daunting How many faux goth Harvard freshmen can I look at while smashing a mediocre crab cake down my gullet All in all Not bad at all I m sure I ll be back to hurt myself again with something else off the menu that is known to cause me gastrointestinal stress 
0esoPf2dr5ekQNRSFD1i9g CMU Dear Yelp Community Let me start by saying that I didn t have particularly high expectations going here on a Tuesday night when the choices were First Printer or John Harvard s next door yet somehow I was overwhelmingly disappointed by First Printer and will not be returning This review should serve as an informative warning though I won t say that I was slighted or offended in any way that should keep you the reader away if you can overlook those things that made my experience so negative I was in a party of three on as I said a Tuesday night and we got there around 7 15 The place wasn t empty but we were seated immediately and most of the tables around us had patrons The first strike against this place was the uninspired menu I sensed no real common theme on the menu some appearances from Cajun New England New York Deli and BBQ On top of this not a single item on the menu stood out Sure there was something called a Printer Dog hot dogs with sauerkraut and chili and a Printer Burger regular burger but there was nothing that I saw that seemed like a unique offering from this restaurant I ordered the Crimson Reuben which is exactly the same as a reuben anywhere else except greasier the bread seemed to be grilled in butter I will say that there was plenty of corned beef on the sandwich but that s about all Between the 3 of us we ordered two cocktails and drank a total of one and a quarter Someone else in my party ordered the Holland Razorblade which was gin citrus syrup and cayenne pepper It was served on crushed ice which was already partly melted and the drink was too watered down to enjoy I ordered the Ginger Snap with ginger liqueur maple whisky cinnamon and topped with cream The cream was so overwhelming that the entire drink tasted unpleasantly like the icing that accompanies a Cinnabon Would not order again We had the calamari appetizer which was actually quite good but sides that we ordered were underwhelming The pinwheel fries sounded appealing but ended up being plain steak fries that were bent a little Again a sad attempt to personalize some ubiquitous menu item The lobster pups their sophisticated lobster and butter infused version of hushpuppies were dry to the point that our two orders of them went uneaten save the one each of us had to ascertain their inedibility Perhaps you ve noticed a negative tone in this review that seems out of touch with my description so far which brings me to the service Oh the service The service alone made this review a 1 star no brainer but the food and drinks did the restaurant no favors Anyway we walked in at 7 15 and were seated and our order was taken in a reasonable amount of time Our drinks and appetizers arrived in a not too long window but then our waiter must have forgotten to place our food order because at 8 15 we asked about our entrees and he said oh sorry this is my fault they should be coming out soon and vanished When our food FINALLY did come the sides we had requested accompanying each appetizer were matched with the wrong entrees which resulted in a lot of scraping food onto bread plates and then passing those around the table There is absolutely no reason that our food should have taken over an hour from time of order to time on table finally after 8 30 considering we ordered 3 sandwiches and the restaurant wasn t crowded However somehow it did manage to take our server over an hour to feed our party unacceptable To his credit he did apologize and take the appetizer and sides off the bill However when he brought the bill to our table he handed us the check for another table a man a few tables away who had a couple beers and a couple appetizers I almost wish I lacked the integrity keeping me from silently paying that bill instead of ours as it was less than half the price of ours and I was pretty fed up by my experience at First Printer and so swapped that bill for the real one settled up and got out of there swearing to both write this and never return to First Printer 
0ET9HFBZreJ7_SrhdvCZaA CMU This place has pretty good drinks It s a bit tiny inside but has a patio that makes up for it The decor is dim and sleek on the inside The cocktail specials are great anything with chocolate is This is one of the few places that closes at 2am in Cambridge and it s never too packed A great place for last call 
0eVOsiUeoJrlLRs5jw6ENA CMU Went here on a Saturday night with a friend wanting to be social with other bar people since it always looks busy when I walk past towards Karma Yoga My pear amaretto martini was good the service was good the moules frites that someone else at the bar ordered looked good However nothing was so great that it wow d me or made me want to become a regular 
0fBi-wewk96l5vJrZcKIQA CMU I ve heard nothing about this place prior to coming here for a super late dinner but I was immediately tempted to be whisked away through its doors because whenever I walked to my friend s apartment I d smell this AMAZING pizza on the street And they say the smell is half the fun I m glad my friend and I came here today although I do wish I came on an emptier stomach and at an earlier hour I m not a fan of late meals Hostess was friendly and our waiter had a really pleasant voice and was courteous but not as attentive as he could ve been However the experience was generally swell and I was rather happy with my pizza It s plenty for one person and there are many selections that are vegetarian friendly I loved mine with the kalamata olives but I think it was a tad on the greasy side Crust is thin and dough has a nice chewy texture Oh I forgot I shared a salad with my friend and we were surprised when it came out Unlike most salads our plate was a large wedge of lettuce with dressing poured all over the top making it difficult to dive in Also I asked the waiter to skip the bacon but it seems he forgot to inform the chef So not so great to taste the bacon ness as I crunched through my lettuce But the lettuce tomatoes were incredibly FRESH and it was possibly the most delicious lettuce I ve ever had in a very long time Haha There s a nice list of drinks wine beer cocktails Got the my blue heaven I think for 9 and was pleasantly surprised with a very large cup For 9 I think that was pretty sweet The drink was good but very fruit juice tasting so I guess if that s your thing you d like it The main reason I tried it was because it had organic blueberries some of which were floating in the drink and were super yummy and organic lemonade Satisfying oh yes 
0ff8FlS-1rNkTwc28uATLw CMU I have a deep love for pizza and I live across the street so Za starts out ahead for sure Although Za might be trying a little too hard I enjoyed my experience there Both the food and service were good I will say that I think the salads were a little too fancy in my opinion I appreciate that they try something different and I am all for classing it up a bit but let s be honest with ourselves it s a pizza place Splitting a pizza and salad should fill you up and at a reasonable cost I would go again 
0FpKKOcTKfojwzUxhDCd7g CMU I thought EVOO was good Not great The service was okay They seemed distracted and uninterested in us Perhaps it was because there was a very large party there The food was good I thought the apps were tasty but the main meals were not anything special My husband got the soft shell crab stuffed with sausage which was just bizarre looking It was deep fried standing up straight on the plate with a huge sausage through it very strange And honestly the deep fried ness of it made it too greasy I had the steak which was cooked great and was very good Overall it was good but with all the buzz around this place I was expecting better 
0FpkxmbOoI_8Iw5P75sLcQ CMU Beautiful restaurant love the open kitchen and brick walls It was very romantic and quaint The Chef s Whim was definitely a winning choice Service was very professional and subtle Love the bartenders who were playful helpful and had great sense of humor 
0gioWzGORQ-2w73Bev2uog CMU Atmosphere is absolutely to die for I fell in love the moment we stepped in Perfect sort of attitude you d love to begin a meal with especially if you re on a date All the staff we interacted with were so kind and helpful We had made a reservation and ended up in a cute room next to a fireplace another with another couple Cute little items on shelves throughout the place added to the charm My drink Paper Chase was wonderful and actually contained alcohol albeit a little pricey but hey you get what you pay for The bar seems amazing here with outstanding selection with beer hard liquor and wine options Except we were informed the Monk s Blood is no longer MADE despite it still being on the menu but not available obviously The not your typical cheese creamy cheese and crackers thin flaky crunchy were very tasty and the delve outside the norm was appreciated The lobster crab dip with pita chips was outstanding I don t even like lobster But this might have me going back alone The pita chips were not an afterthought or vehicle for serving but an actual enhancing part of the dish Our entrees the roasted half chicken and slow roasted brisket were good but we both agreed they were lacking something the extra flavor we were looking for given the atmosphere presentation and after following that wondrous dip We opted for the triple chocolate terrine for dessert which my companion enjoyed but didn t quite hit the sweet spot for me There are only three choices for dessert so I hope they expand the menu The menu seems to partly change and partly stay as evidenced by some other yelpers reviews on items not offered while I was there mushroom risotto sounds amazing The apps and drinks were great on my visit and I ll keep trying new things with the entrees because honestly I just want to love every aspect of PARK 
0GmeHxgzLcevYFbXBmBzcQ CMU If you are looking for standard lunch fare in Kendall square then black sheep won t disappoint However for 16 dollars it s a little too standard meaning I could probably recreate 90 of this menu at home They do nothing to push the envelope The decor is cute and definitely makes you feel as if you are a farm in Kansas rather than techie Kendall square but a room with no windows That s even worse than a cubicle 
0gSCY881vHVpNIlN74evNw CMU I really liked all the food at Russell House Tavern but I feel the need to drop 2 stars because of the immensely slow service All of the food on the menu is exactly what a gastropub promises every dish is thoughtful tasty complex and just perfectly delicious in your mouth presentation is gorgeous as well But then you get to the waiter service after ordering our drinks it probably took over 30 minutes for them to arrive Of course during this time they did bring over the wine glasses for us to stare at but not the actual bottle to fill them up Then when we asked for more bread to go with one of the dishes this took another 30 minutes at which point we already finished the dish The finale getting the bill took just as long it honestly all exhausted and overwhelmed my experience The waiter was extremely friendly but I can t tell if they just don t have enough waiters or he would forget about us when he left but it s a good enough reason for me not to want to come back 
0GVNKP03o8KZAcIFlnNBhg CMU It s good but a total nightmare if you are indecisive like me Sometimes choice is a bad thing As with my visits to Coldstone Creamery I end up selecting a combination of things so unoriginal that I should have just gone to any normal restaurant that creates the dishes or ice cream flavors for you Clearly Fire and Ice is for the creative food types I can appreciate this though five stars for being good at what they do 
0h4rAUNZruxRS4fROMi8SA CMU I have a feeling this place is going to do pretty well in the Square It has a very casual elegant feel to it We got seats at one of the five or six tables they have in their back garden area Very nice ambiance back there But the inside also has a very comfortable feel to it lotsa wood just the right size to feel intimate without claustrophobia setting in They even have a nice little bar area you can sit at and with their list of wines for under 50 bucks this could be a good place to visit to split a bottle with someone Their menu is very well put together For a place that calls itself Conundrum and spells it out on the menu cover what it means to them is many things coming together in a paradox or something like it does a good job of not being all over the place in styles It s basically doing gourmet dishes at a reasonable price with a California slant to it we were told the chef is from there The waiter was perfectly attentive and knowledgeable He even warned me that the saffron risotto that goes with the baked stuffed sole might be too tart but they feel it is a perfect compliment to the dish I declined the warning and well yeah I thought it was too tart but still tasty It was just a bit overpowering the fish couldn t quite withstand it which was a shame because the stuffed sole was magnificent As was the wine and the after diner port with the creme brulee and the scallop appetizer I ll definitely be returning 
0HeQh_QGzU-7o9bSiiq18g CMU This place is phenomenal The service is excellent I ordered the Strozapretti with their finest Ros and wasnt dissapointed at all The food was sumtous and had amazing flavor As if the chef seriously spent an hour perfecting my dish Dessert wasnt that great but I wasn t complaining It s seriously pink in there The decor is great and i love the little hand painted zebras everywhere Its definitely a Cambridge staple for me 
0hqtnbmyywOzW6yZRIKSEg CMU This place has a very pleasent atmosphere and a very overall hip feeling to it It was pretty expensive though for food that wasn t all that amazing Good service though and excellent bread and olive oil 
0hvilfiIZxlZF-PTaWeHIg CMU First I ve been vegan for 12 years I ve traveled the world and eaten at veggie restaurants all over My sister in law is a professional vegan chef So I m picky I went into Veggie Gallaxy with mediocre hopes I assumed that the food would be generic diner veggie food uncreative and sloppy It wasn t We ordered a veggie burger some sort of fake meat dinner stuffed waffles vegan omlette a spicy dish with beans I think 5 different frappes and 5 different desserts including a chocolate cake lemon merangue Boston cream pudding and a cheesecake A couple of the meals I thought were good but average The vegan omlete was really good and not made out of a disgusting mushy pile of tofu like most vegan eggs The stuffed French toast was amazing The veggie burger was exactly what one would hope for The onion rings were sparse but very very good The frappes were very shake like Pretty good but not complicated The dishes all had veggies included which was a nice touch that s not normally included in diner food The veggies were all cooked perfectly and not mushy or wet The desserts were all above avg many people don t realize that most vegan cakes you can buy in stores are almost all shortening or earth balance These are clearly made using high quality ingredients The creams and pudding fillings didn t taste like overwhelming soy flavor like most vegan puddings Very rich and perfect consistency One of the cakes was slightly dry but it had a cream topping that added moisture The lemon in the lemon meringue Was very strong and a hair overpowering for me but my husband loved it The atmosphere was good the booths are large and comfy and we didn t feel like we were being rushed at all Our waitress was the BEST most attentive waitress I have EVER had My glass was literally never half full and she anticipated our needs Other people who worked there said hi and nodded or smiled We noticed a wide variety of people there people with kids older people Young tattooed people And super dressy ladies with briefcases Overall I think it s the most comfortable cleanest vegan option in the boston area 
0hW68_bLddBq7_nDaZWF7Q CMU A friend of mine has managed to build a bit of a relationship with the staff at Russell House and when he brought us there tonight we were treated like straight up royalty I think it says a lot about the hospitality of the staff that just because a manager knew my friend s face our party of four was greeted with a jump to the front of the waitlist on a busy night to a nice table nonetheless and drinks on the house The waitstaff was incredibly attentive and helpful throughout the night checking on us frequently Also the ambiance is really perfect chatty but with a lot of quiet corners and there s a sort of understated classiness about the place that s really nice I might be bringing people back here in future for this alone but everything about the food and drink was similarly wonderful Russell House serves up a really nice mix of comforting and innovative gastropub type fare and everything was luscious I especially liked the Crispy Pig s Head Cake which is everything good about pork deep fried and served with a poached egg and a mapley reduction of some sort It was sweet and unctuous and decadent The raw bar is a huge plus If you re looking for a place in Cambridge to stop for a round of oysters this is your ticket Island Creek seems to always be a good bet round these parts and Russell stocks them I had two friends with me who had never had oysters before and I knew this would be a good place to initiate them they came away oyster lovers Totally fresh briny and perfect Gotta give a nod to the extensive drinks lists as well I haven t tried out their cocktails yet but the house list is the sort of mixology type experimentation I ve come to enjoy lots of St Germaine and rye When I was uncertain about which beer to order they have a nice assortment of craft brews many local the waitstaff was amazingly attentive and knowledgeable in helping me pick asking about my preferences before making recommendations So fun Seriously good stuff Thanks for the wonderful evening Russell House I ll be back 
0i4e5rX7SC_fwUnWWTIpBA CMU Like other reviewers I find that Firebrand Saints doesn t totally live up to its potential I ve had the traditional beef burger which was okay but not worth the price after adding cheese and other toppings Plus you pay for any sides like fries etc If you re actually hungry the burgers won t really even fill you up at least in my experience so some sort of side or app is necessary I m not a huge fan of the steak fries which I ve found to usually be way too thick and sometimes even undercooked On the plus side I dig the atmosphere and the staff have always been helpful and nice Bartenders seem to know what they are doing too The last time I ate here I avoided the burgers and opted for the roasted beef french dip sandwich which was absolutely delicious The meat was tender and juicy and had great flavor The roll it was served on managed to hold up nicely as well So I m starting to think FS s bright moments will come from other parts of the menu outside of the burgers I m definitely planning to head back and test out the theory partly because the location is so convenient and partly because I m still trying to figure out what the hell is going on with the video art at the bar 
0I9WVWsF5cQvrCwrTL43Xg CMU This place is freaking amazing My mom and I came here on a visit to Boston and I plan to come back every time I am in the area The decor is super cute and homey like a countryside cottage or rustic home It was upscale dining but not too fancy or stuffy like fine dining usually is It was very comfortable and quaint like eating at mom pop restaurant For appetizers we ordered the corn crab chowder an a cheese platter Both were outstanding the chowder was filled with tons of crab and wasn t cream based like new England clam chowder so it wasn t too rich or heavy and the cheese platter was just the right amount of cheese and fruit to satisfy and not overindulge For our entrees we ordered the crab cakes the special of the night and the half herb crusted chicken Again both were YUM I don t usually like crab cakes because there is never much crab in them and mostly filler but these crab cakes were the total opposite all crab with little filler which was awesome They were served with homemade tartar sauce and a homemade coleslaw which were both super fresh and flavorful The herb crusted chicken was cooked to perfection still juicy and tender but the crusted skin was crispy We also ordered a side of roasted beets that were friggin awesome but that could just be because beets themselves are friggin awesome Dessert is where I absolutely died I love love love desserts but can t stand desserts that are too sweet or too rich The dessert menu had about 10 items on it and I wanted to order one of each because they all sounded amazing I was torn between the orange chiffon cake with pistachio ice cream meringue cookie chocolate bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream or maple cheesecake with fresh maple syrup and vanilla sauce The server said that the chocolate bread pudding is always on the menu but the other two are seasonal specials I had at that point already decided I am coming back at some point in the future so I decided to save the bread pudding for my next visit and went with the cheesecake I was a little worried the cheesecake might be too heavy or super sweet especially with maple syrup but it was so light with just the perfect hint of sweetness I swear it was like heaven in dessert form I basically fell in love with that piece of cheesecake and when it was all gone I died a little inside I still think about it sometimes that distant memory of heaven on earth will forever be with me and someday soon I will revisit to try another dessert which judging from the scrumptiousness of my first visit will not disappoint 
0Ig3sJ7MAAYSRUPGXSGWUg CMU Ok Good not great On the plus side the buns had been toasted just right On the down side there was a greasy oil slick that spread ominously And the fries were forgettable I m planning on heading back at some point to try one of their specialty burgers but I agree with Che s review that you shouldn t just get a burger That said it s passable and has a super convenient location right off the T toward Brattle 
0Ius7C-ASoCUO-UZJzg5Cw CMU Service was great Menus were cute Food was ok The amuse bouche was a cold cucumber type drink We had the duck and fish as entrees I would recommend the fish over the duck if one had to choose between the two I would avoid not sitting at the table next to the pillar near the waiting area It can get a bit loud with large crowds waiting to be seated 
0ja2IhYeBjikTTMXvfsKQw CMU The food at Craigie is always good but you d better have a reservation We went recently with a group of 6 to celebrate my wife s birthday She wanted one of their amazing burgers but we were sat in the main dining room and they don t serve the bar food there Small sadness Most of the table got the steak It had a sauce that some felt was too sweet and others felt was perfect It was unanimous though that the steak lacked a robust beefy flavor Disappointment all around I had the veal tenderloin and sweetbreads I was a little nervous about the sweetbreads since I m not big on organs and glands but it was delicious It had a springy yet soft texture and a very mild flavor that was complimented well by the sauce The tenderloin was tasty but nothing really to write home about We also got a side of brussel sprouts cooked in duck fat Even if you don t like brussel sprouts do yourself a favor and get these if they have them The sprouts are halved and then browned in a pan with the fat giving them a rich smoky flavor that was to die for The staff was friendly attentive and quick Craigie s always been a good bet for us when we want to have a special night out but don t want to spend a fortune 
0joISUUXV_NpGFEOgLeRSA CMU We came here last night for Restaurant Week and were excited to find the entire menu on offer for 33 you get your choice of app entree side and dessert or you could choose the Chef s Special menu which was 38 and had a more limited special selection I had heard that HT was really expensive and so I d never been but was happy to find that usually the most expensive entree was only 24 definitely not an every week meal for me but not exorbitant or unreasonable IMO and worth it for the quality in the end for sure The homemade breads to start with came out almost immediately before our drinks even and were really tasty I loved the cranberry nut and the andama is one of my favorite New England breads and so hard to find The third was a standard unmemorable white For cocktails I had the Strawberry Rhubarb Martini and it was divine the house infused strawberry vodka literally tasted like fresh ripe strawberries exploding in your mouth that s what she said and the house made rhubarb simple syrup added the perfect amount of subtle flavor and sweetness Plus 1 of each goes towards Mt Auburn s breast cancer fund so it was a major win The boy liked his cucumber gin martini For an app I chose the crab cake It was on the small side with a side of tartar like sauce and some kind of small slaw but it had barely any filler just pure delicious crab seared nicely on the outside and tender on the inside A nice start to the meal The boy got the spinach salad with blueberries decent good but nothing impressive For my entree I got the pork chop which was totally delicious The large chop itself was cooked almost perfectly I personally could have gone for a minute less cooking time I ve come to appreciate pork on the pink side but that s just me seared nicely on the outside and flavorful and juicy on the inside The applejack glaze sauce was outrageously good and the homemade applesauce was excellent My side choice was the mashed potatoes red potatoes with the skin kept on and loads of chunks my favorite and they were especially good in the applejack sauce The boy had the duck which he was pleased with although he admitted that my pork was better muhahaha and his side was broccoli which was just plain and pretty boring good dipped in our respective sauces however For dessert I had the strawberry shortcake and the boy had the Taza chocolate cheesecake and both were excellent I could have used a bit more corn flavor in my shortcake and a smidge less denseness but the flavors were solid The cheesecake was great as is light and fluffy and full of Taza chocolate flavor with a complimentary raspberry sauce Service was kind relaxed but attentive The atmosphere was comfortable relaxed like being in a farmhouse among friends a good thing I d call this an excellent RW choice and would totally come back here again even during a non Restaurant Week I adore their commitment to seasonal local ingredients and what I ve tasted thus far has all been pretty delicious and definitely craveable 
0KcBN1fiPjz9esKnEv3Ijw CMU Wow This place is great First of all it s a cool looking place That is unusual in a veggie vegan eatery But what really is outstanding is the food I ordered The Club sandwich Yummy simply yummy The place was packed on a Saturday at lunch and I found the service prompt friendly and informative on the menu I will return 
0KfIVIwJsn2Oxeo5YujD2Q CMU This is a great location for this place You walk into a cafe style bar area and as you realize you are not in the main dining room you descend down the stairs to a pantheon of flavors and spirits too much No Probably but it did feel like the Bat Cave I refused to go to this place on a weekend night because I fore casted a mobbed bar unappreciative diners and hey restaurants just are not as good on the weekends I started with one of the cocktails a rye based Harvard Yard while the lady had a very respectable and punchy white We decided to to some sharing of small plates and had the soft shell crab pizza of which I could have simply ate the soft shell crab off the top and been happy the deep fried egg an epicure s delight and what I thought was the highlight the smoked pork shoulder terrine with mustard seed and honey gelee Yeah it really is as good as it sounds and probably better Words do not do the terrine justice as it brought me to provincial France a British public house and to my hometown Jawjah in a single bite Reeling but unfazed we split the obligatory roast chicken It was perfectly cooked and the carrots were wonderfully shaped and roasted I guarantee that there was no butter in the mashed potatoes None HA At some point during the meal I had a Wachusett Belgian that I was not to fond of as the server though cheery was not as knowledgeable about beer as should could have been working at a place to this caliber I wanted something with bright hops aromatics and a touch of bitterness and I got a syrupy viscousy amber Belgian Desert was an afterthought after my food baby started knocking at my ribcage but they had carrot cake bread pudding That s right beloved carrot cake with beloved bread pudding coupled together like the Olson twins although of course they would not partake With a mini scoop of ice cream I was induced into a mini food coma It was worth the trip to Harvard square on the oft dreaded 66 and I ll be back Three things of note The bartender is always changing up the cocktails and is of good pedigree as he was formally at Drink This place will fill up so definitely make reservations to eat downstairs Summers are great at university proximate places like this because many of the students are gone This a a place for seasonal ingredients and orgainic biodynamic wines If it is not in season they don t have it Thank you RHT 
0KtHgL8vNKPiLA0fZsyt0w CMU So exciting to find a place like this The crispy egg was incredible better than Eastern Standard s sweetbread frisee salad which is similar Chicken liver crostinis were guuuud short rib Wellington a good hearty stew My cocktail was perfect also exactly what I was looking for Nice job and great atmosphere 
0LLJJcFDeTWpPUaPBsCQSg CMU I ve been to Craigie twice once for the tasting menu and last night for the burger and I think it s easily one of the best restaurants in Boston Not only is their food incredible but their service is also on par with what 5 restaurants should aspire to Last night we took a group of friends to the bar to try the infamous Craigie burger Due to some miscommunication when I called a couple of weeks back I thought they didn t take reservations in the bar they do apparently The manager was incredibly sympathetic and helpful and we worked it to split our group into 2 smaller tables She kept checking up on us brought the ladies out a bowl of the brussel sprouts to taste awesome and was super attentive even when we were only ordering off of the bar menu Now on to the burger The beef is sourced from Hardwick beef in Western Mass It s mixed with miso paste and bone marrow cooked in a CVap open and quickly charred on a plancha It s topped with cheddar fried onions and house made ketchup It s served with perfectly seasoned slightly spicy steak fries It s indescribably good incredibly rich and quite simply the best burger I ve ever tasted The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare stays unbelievably juicy because of the cooking methods and the bone marrow takes it to the edge of being too rich without quite getting there It s great to see how versatile Chef Tony Maws truly is Craigie is known for unique culinary masterpieces but Maws also can perfect the burger for the bar Combine this with awesome service and you ve got Craigie on Main Tips For the burger try to make a reservation at the bar they apparently have like 4 tables you can reserve Otherwise get there early they open at 5 30 grab a seat at the bar and enjoy I ve heard they run out of burgers because they only get enough beef for 20 30 per day 
0Lsy-1JOmiRPnhIlgDL-7Q CMU Wow Great food and a great ambience They are also good at dealing with dietary concerns Tiago is a winning server And be sure to finish it off with grappa 
0luZHb1SYeoM4sT74G_cLA CMU I don t know why but I can t formulate full sentences about this place Actually I know why It s aftermath from cocktail trivia here with their treacherous bar manager Lino last night So some fragments 1 Alice in Wonderland 2 Brunch is ok but can I have five more baskets of those sticky buns on the side plz 3 Cocktails are innovative and great Injuriously so 4 Next time I m stea um borrowing a copy of their wine list folder for study material Something that well organised and extensive has got to be for studying Not spilling your drink on 5 A drunken four year old did do the decor 6 Still in search of said four year old to design me some clothes 7 Can I have sticky buns with my cocktail 
0lyzh_wcylq1pNHZaVizfQ CMU Overpriced pizzas and salads of mediocre quality and miniscule portions For great pizzas I would go to Emma s instead 
0M-oBOoyL2IUsaR5q9hweQ CMU I visited Boston once a few years back and the friend i was with brought us to the B Side To this day the B Side remains one of my favorite bars ever All I really remember is drinking way too many B Side Cars and being super stoked they were playing The Exploding Hearts Big ups to Boston and the B Side 
0MceN5at9oYXCZ3z4swENQ CMU Conundrum provided great atmosphere in the back garden patio good service and delectable foods Though they offered a 30 3 course prix fixe menu we opted to choose from the regular menu and had almost as good of a deal The scallops appetizer was as large as I ve had at other restaurants for an entree The scallops were incredibly fresh tasting like the sea The mole free range chicken was delicious as good of a mole as I ve had anywhere in California For dessert we shared a timely pumpkin creme brulee that was quite nice The wine list is fairly priced and carefully chosen I would definitely come back especially in warmer months when I can sit in the garden patio area again 
0mTE9-09yE5A1yfdegcwag CMU We recently celebrated my wife s birthday at Henrietta s They easily accommodated the very large group 20 and did an excellent job in service The food was great as always and the modest cake cutting fee included ice cream A sign of a very good restaurant is being able to provide very good food and a very high standard of service consistently Henrietta s fits that mold 
0MYc9pvUnpm4v54GuX5Xfg CMU I grab a chicken sandwich from here pretty regularly skipping the house sauce it s really good Their burgers are tasty too and the fries are greasy but good The staff aren t particularly friendly and the line can be pretty long It s cheap good food that keeps me coming back There s a decent amount of seating upstairs They should get rid of the table by the condiments bar and make more room for people who are waiting on their food 
0nOtPB4cULkN91sh14DxkA CMU This is a certainly a favorite of mine and a restaurant that I can best describe as outstanding comfort food There is a certain respect I have for restaurants that consistently deliver such quality food as they do here I prefer to sit at the bar and allow Scott to work his magic mixology I ll leave to you to select your favorites from the menu there are many and I certainly have enjoyed my share Cheers my friends 
0O27J6dppi0Zj7E7gYSFdQ CMU I loved the decor and the cocktails I did not love the food or the prices The service was OK We started with undecided cocktails Ala Drink you give a couple dos and don ts for me that was no gin and nothing fruity and then you get a surprise cocktail I ended up with some sort of wonderfully perfect bourbon concoction That was the highlight of the evening My husband started with wanting something on the fruitier side He got a variation of a french martini Then when we got our entrees we had to flag down someone order a second drink because food runners brought the food and the server never came over to check to see if we had everything We asked for a drink to pair with the rabbit We got a scotch cocktail by the time we were two bites away from finishing the rabbit So food Both our entrees were just shy of 30 each The cod was on the dry side and really bland The rabbit was better but the breading inside was way over seasoned The pasta appetizer we got was probably the best part but even that had way too much bacon which over powered the rest of the flavors on the dish We got it because of the black truffle which we tasted none of Actually the best part of all was the dipping sauce for the bread In the end I would go back for drinks it s easier and closer then going to Drink but skip the food 
0OA7Kxg8Iw7JhRug3atdyg CMU Stopped by here last week before a flight out to the west coast and decided to have a few drinks and dinner I sat at the bar and had the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA a half dozen oysters and braised pork shank Oysters were fresh and the beer was cold As for the pork shank it was good but not great All and all I ll be back and service was great 
0Od9-lu-caWQM9HVmh7Byw CMU Two words Super Overhyped I liked this place much more when I came 3 years ago Either I ve now had better desserts or the quality has gone down since I had teh great flourless chocolate cake here 3 years ago We actually went for a full meal desserts and was really underwhelmed by everything from decor atmosphere to the food itself At least the service was good Here s a rundown Dinner Pear Cranberry Salad Limpy leaves tasteless pears not ripe yet and hard to chew Terrible salad I m not sure where hte dressing went either and the only flavor came from teh candied walnuts and cranberries Scallop Linguine Noodles were all stuck together like it d been sitting out forever and the scallops were terribly overdone The brussel sprouts were the best part of the dish if you can imagine that Bacon Onion quiche This was the best dish of the 3 guess you can t go wrong with bacon cheese egg and flaky goodness Dessert We got the 6 piece sampler and only really enjoyed the creme brulee Creme Brulee Pretty standard fair a scoop was taken out of hte ramiken so there wasn t much but what was there was pretty good Whoopie I don t understand how folks can love this because it is basically two small pieces of brownie with gross custard between it I actually scraped the custard off the texture was grainy Boston Creme Pie The dessert sampler looked so gross that I didn t even try it My friend took 1 bite and never returned to it It was pretty bad Strawberry Shortcake There is no cake to this it s a crusty sugar cookie with some standard creme and unfresh strawberries on it With the exception of the average creme brulee these are actually the worst desserts I ve ever had at a restaurant Overall I was incredibly disappointed We d planned to get a cake for later and skipped on that after this bad quality Save your money because you re not really getting anything here and now I m actually feeling a bit queasy which doesn t help either 
0oRdnLoVXEg7u7hL2K-BmA CMU I was aware of the prices i would face before coming here but was unfortunately not aware of the poor quality After a difficult morning deciding whether to go to super 88 and get some shopping done or come here and go to brunch my friend convinced me of the later Bad Move When i see high prices i expect good quality or good portions All this place had was a nice name Even the interior left something to be desired with an exposed ceiling and inappropriate music Although i can not complain about my tomato and gorgonzola soup I will complain about my salad The pear and edive salad left a greased bitter unfullfilled taste in my mouth I also requested to have the bacon removed and it was not mistakes happen I could not finish the salad not due to size but lack of intrest I left this establishment with a dent in my wallet and only a strong desire for some more pear 
0OX1oP16CQCxHem_02qmiQ CMU I d give the food 3 5 stars but the half star comes from its commitment to locally grown foods and sustainability I liked the concept of the restaurant and the waiters non stuffy dress The photos of food all over the walls are beautiful and the menus are printed on recycled paper We had the tomato mozarella and basil pesto salad at the bar while we were waiting for a table It was quite delicious and the grains of salt add a punch when they dissolve on your tongue Yum We moved to a table where we ordered the grit cakes with mushrooms corn and some kind of bean cannelini My friend had the salmon and a side of dragon beans Food was aiiiight I thought the mushroom saute that topped my grit cakes was very well seasoned but the cakes themselves were a bit bland The whole thing could have used an herb of some sort to give it some punch My friend said his salmon was okay We had several others join us for dessert which proved to be Henrietta s gem We ordered the pecan pie which was served as an individual pie warm from the oven and with a scoop of ice cream Everyone loooved it It had a deep caramel flavor and a complexity of browned butter that most pecan pies don t have and it wasn t overladen by goopy sugar mess The crust was flaky and crispy We also got the chocolate bread pudding another winner though I just don t like the taste of cooked bananas and it was served with some We had the pumpkin whoopie pies which were a fun concept and served with hot apple cider and a pear and frangipane tart which was also good but surprisingly lower on the yummy list We also had some of their sorbets chocolate peach and lime which were served in one glass unfortunately mixing the flavors and leading my friend to dub it chocolatey 7 up Boo Overall delicious dessert average entrees friendly though intermittent attention and extra stars for sustainability and locally grown when possible 
0p-3-jE4ZNH-ieRnA9Xycw CMU very upscale restaurant with excellent service and good food the chicken liver mousse was very good if you like pate types of appetizers never had to call the waiter over for anything bread and water was brought and refilled without asking and he divided our check without any complaints 
0P4Z7JQsYXCQrYymi_SsoA CMU This was my first dinner at Upstairs on the Sq and hopefully not my last I was a little apprehensive as the reviews were a bit uneven The wait staff was attentive The atmosphere lovely and more importantly the food well prepared inventive and tasty I would like to try their afternoon tea as it would be fun and enjoyable way to wind down on a Sunday afternoon One drawback was the valet was nowhere to be found when trying to park it was a rainy night so that was a bummer 
0pePe38tN8ia-Pd-Kl7Ntw CMU Ate there last night wanting to dine outside Did get a table on the patio Service was very good Food VERY average The catfish was tasty but the mashed potatoes and broccoli were like anyone makes at home The lobster carbonara and the papardelli bognases were both cold and just not very tasty For 115 for 3 people before tax and tip with no alcohol it was very expensive There are far better choices in Harvard sq 
0Pi1JDfD4MowpW2it-WqmA CMU Went on a Sunday and the menu was prix fixe 3 courses for 38 Food was very good but service was seriously lacking espeially for the prices Our waiter was rude and inattentive Other servers brought the food to the table but he was no where to be found leaving us to explain who ordered what and direct traffic Waiter never asked how anything was and never noticed that our glasses were empty Of course he added 18 gratuity to the bill anyways 
0qlxSeg7TcgDf0khD0Dx5Q CMU Bought a groupon and decided to try it out on a Friday night I loved the atmosphere upbeat vibe with people ready to have a good time The food is where this place really shines I got the half chicken with potato fingerlings and roasted veggies The chicken was so unbelievably tender My boyfriend got the Souel burger which he loved The burger was full of flavor and had a fried egg on it Amazing This place is a really good start to trying Asian infused foods without feeling apprehensive about what your going to get The menu has a good selection of comfort foods with a twist of Asian flavor The waiter we had could not have been nicer He was very personable attentive and went out of his way to suggest certain foods and beers I thought it was really nice of the owner to come over at the end of our meal and chat with us for a couple minutes He was very friendly and told us the different things they have going on each day of the week My new thing is going to be Tues evenings from 4 7 raw bar 1 oysters This place is great and I will definitely be coming back esp on Tues nights 
0ra-Fb9idZFAzP0Ob961Ew CMU this is the second time i went w my bf tonight s dishes were marvelous the food portions are bigger and tastier we had rissoto pizza lamb filet mignon and desserts they all tasted very very good our fav ones are the rissoto pizza and lamb normally i am not a pizza fan but last time we were here the portions where so small that we had to get an after meal so this time i figured pizza would be more filling that was a good choice the pizza was figs argurla and cured meat flat bread it had a sweetness to it and it was big although it took a long time for the pizza to come out but was worth it i would go back again to try their 4 courses for 15 next time 
0RzRo34d1VUx3OUWw8fjMg CMU I have eaten here several times going back 2 or so years This place is great the wine list is good it has a nice fire place in bar in winter and the food is always very very good I bring friends from out of town and dates there They have a good Sunday Brunch also 
0s-BYBxJ4eSL78JWBkptWQ CMU Great place but to get the whole experience get the ten course tasting but be prepared to spend a lot if money Make reservations at the table by the kitchen so you can watch them cook Chef very friendly and personally brings you the last course himself Worth the money 
0S2Yay2YzAjgq2Dw8DLFiw CMU Meatloaf burger is really good 
0SJVPPq_9ZILlt4lbFPElw CMU This is a wonderful restaurant with one of the best farm to table committments I ve ever seen in an eatery All of their food is sourced regionally and sustainably and that wins points in my book off the bat The fact that they serve top shelf food is an incredible second feather in their already many feathered cap The crab and corn chowder is delightful I was afraid that the crab would overwhelm the corn but not so this is a perfect balance of the rich earthy flavor of the crab and the sweet corn taste with a beautiful blend of spice and seasoning enhancements The ribeye steak was unreal It was so tender it reminded both me and my friend of a cut of prime rib but without the bland flavor of that cut the rich heady taste of the ribeye burst through every bite The entrees were so good that they almost didn t call for sides but the asparagus was a perfectly crisped compliment to an extraordinary meal With regard to price Henrietta s is INCREDIBLY competitive for what they offer non CAFO meats produce that hasn t been trucked across the country and healthy meals The decor was a little weird I felt kind of like I was eating in a Crate Barrel outlet and the service was a little rushed but hey Saturday night what do you expect One of my more favorite dining destinations in the Peoples Republik we will definitely be back for a second visit 
0SoAaN4udxZllp7Wbb7rDQ CMU I LOVE LOVE LOVE and MISS MISS MISS Finale I was SO excited when Finale entered Harvard Square because I d heard so much about the one in Boston but never ventured that far Finale knows how to provide truly excellent customer service One of my first visits to Finale I came on a date Just after we d sat down and had our first sip of water we were asked very politely to move to a nearby table so that a larger party could take over our area We said that was fine and moved over The waitress thanked us graciously and then the manager came over to say thank you and to tell us we would be receiving a free dessert Then as we were leaving the manager gave us a bag of 3 delicious desserts to go Wow I would love to move tables any time for all of that I would also come to Finale to enjoy delicious dessert cocktails and sweets with the girls at an outside table Finale may not be cheap but is AMAZING 
0TRrQzeZxsWmDb-XgA3wuA CMU Best restaurant in Cambridge The mussels and french fries are awesome The wait can be frustrating but well worth it 
0USWjAdsgvdJZrstJF5fBw CMU Cool place nice bartenders decent food When you first walk in there is a long gas fireplace with a small but nice seating area to have a drink or wait for the table The place has minimalist and modern decor with concrete floors high ceilings natural wood and stone There is a lot of space between the tables and the bar stools so you don t feel packed in The have a decent beer selection but mostly for the bottled beers The draught beer selection is a little lackluster I had the Mayflower Oatmeal Stout for 6 which is OK for this type of place My friend is selective about her martinis and she enjoyed them The meals are a bit on the pricey side 15 29 and smaller portions It s more about the taste and preparation I got the burger 15 my friend got the skate and we both got arugula salads 9 The salads were decent but not spectacular My friend really liked the skate that came with lentils The burger was cooked as I requested and enjoyable It came with shoestring fries I don t eat fries that often so they need to be special These were not The service was great and as the crowd thinned out the bartender spent some time chatting with us and remembered my friend from a previous visit A big bonus is free parking They validate if you park in the Technology Square lot 
0WUqiknF4b-W83CqKx7DBw CMU Hey if you haven t tried this restaurant then you are missing out on something good With a new chef and menu last nights meal was delicious Try the salmon scallops or the mac n cheese Plus our server Tyler was helpful and funny i highly reccommend this place and plan to make it one of my haunts 
0X5959VL67L1nxjDRnPd3Q CMU Loove finale Yes it s expensive yes I ve heard those rumors about the cakes being baked elsewhere and transported there frozen where they are then thawed and served Okay it s not a rumor my friends used to work there and they told me But still just going in there makes me feel good about the world Look at all the display of desserts so beautiful they double as art I go there when I really want to treat myself to something rich indulgent and full of buttery chocolately joy And I ve never been disappointed Also let me just say the chocolate martini I had there was INCREDIBLE My boyfriend may or may not have told me I had to control myself It was soo good They had substituted hazelnut chocolate instead of plain chocolate because they were out of regular But to this day it is the best chocolate alcoholic drink I have ever experienced Thank you Finale But four stars for the reasons mentioned above sorry 
0xqbsSw7jO3NqS7k1znnNg CMU On their website it says that their Sunday Brunch has been awarded Best Brunch in Boston by the Improper Bostonian every year since 2001 Alright we had to try it out then Well by jove yes It get s my vote as well It is pricey but it is also all you can eat and all the lovely things you love about brunch are at your feet and disposal Waffles eggs smoked salmon cheeses various parts of the pig raw bar mimosas and more oh my Oh yea unlimited OJ how frakin great is that especially when most times you order OJ and it comes in a half sized glass with no refills My gaaaaaawd Finally a reason to wake up early on Sundays 
0XuUM9MS_joBOwdroeqBQg CMU Awesome food and probably the best value in harvard square for a burger 
0xvkrpow_z5FYPGEBaO4wA CMU Service was good food was decent the manager staring at us making us uncomfortable because we brought a cake in for my friends birthday was misery This will be a rant on how much their manager sucks I I know her name but believe that is taking it too far is a gigantic woman who is a manager at the fire and ice in Harvard square After our meal we planed on putting candles in a cake for my friend Sheila to surprise her for her birthday So while she was outside smoking a butt we lit the candles in preparation of her coming back in Then the spineless bitch manager yelled at our sever because we did this and didn t even have the guts to say anything directly She just stared at us like we just kicked her dog and she was ready to attack I mean that s not the way to be in the service area I left angry as hell and on principle wont go back Our food was great our server was awesome but that bastard of a manger ruined my whole experience All because she wanted us to buy one of her deserts 
0Y9aYcTdinslQK0RTsodzw CMU My husband and I LOVE this place I have pretty much tried everything on the menu and I have yet to find something that I have not truly enjoyed The service is exceptional too and that may have something to do with the owner Dillon who often has his hands in just about everything While you are trying to decide what to order enjoy their tasty chips and dip 
0yCvIdcyxj97RV8HZmlnCg CMU I used to come here only because it s close to MIT which is where I worked The food is very inconsistent and often overcooked or dry The sandwiches here are ok and the ingredients are generally fresh but the taste is not up to par for a nice sit down restaurant Also the service although friendly can be veeeery slow during the lunch rush Now I would just go to Area 4 if in the Kendall area 
0yHFcRdXdustKa-RQNs36Q CMU Day Time Wednesday 10 00am Food I went to Henrietta s Table for breakfast and ordered an omelet for myself and pancakes to share just could not decide between sweet and savory that morning The omelet was very good quite fluffy and with a pretty even and generous distribution of filling It was huge so I didn t even come close to finishing it The pancakes were delicious but pretty standard buttermilk pancakes Everything was great with the fresh squeezed orange juice Service We were seated immediately and the service was fairly prompt Overall the service was fine but unremarkable Atmosphere The room was well lit with natural light and the high ceilings made it feel airy Overall a nice atmosphere for breakfast The restaurant was not very crowded so it made a great place to hang out and catch up with a friend The giant pig in the entry way adds a touch of whimsy 
0YNBbdD7-_RIKQs7t3jpJQ CMU One of my very favorite restaurants of all time I should clarify that I m actually referring to Craigie St Bistro but unless they ve done something very wrong since they moved I m sure it s well worth 5 starts My girlfriend and I went at least once a week we lived on craigie circle above the restaurant s original home I have to say that I ll definitely miss that first location Such a great intimate space Fantastic overall dining experience Up there with 9 Park in my book Tony is a genius chef Rather than over complicate he keeps the food simple yet elegant and lets the excellent quality of the ingredients shine His style and approach to food comes across in every beautifully executed plate A testament to his love of the food the ingredients and the techniques Temps are always spot on and everything is plated with confidence and finesse Very seasonal and you re always in for a few wonderful surprises Excellent wine list Lots of great bottles at great prices Never felt up sold In fact quite the opposite I was talked into many an inexpensive gem I don t think Will is there anymore but if he is you re in luck Best server I ve ever had Anywhere Incredibly passionate and knowledgeable Always excited to talk about food and wine and anything else Truly great guy We were often treated to wine and cheese while if we waited for a table They always accommodated us in every way Prime time on Friday night was never a problem I guess that comes with loyalty But it s certainly not a given I don t have any pictures of the food but there are plenty of great ones here already I have nothing bad to say about CSB er COM Oh almost forgot Not sure if they still do them but look for a sunday prix fixe Best deal in town by a long shot 
0YopXTgyTUsXGmgVXbOvkA CMU I typically tend to avoid hotel restaurants but Henrietta s Table located in the Charles Hotel was a real find It s a bustling little place with a nice bar area and an ample restaurant I really appreciated the focus on local ingredients by their chef who offers a nightly special menu which incorporates the catch of the day and local produce and cheeses Anything and everything you would want is here at Henrietta s Nice beer and wine selection interesting appetizers and a diverse menu For dinner I tried the corn and crab chowder which was dense rich and loaded with chunks of fresh crab meat I also order the skip a whitefish that came with a pesto sauce cheese studded mashers and a side of fiddle head ferns as an aside fiddle head ferns were my downfall at the Elite Cook Off what the heck ARE these things No matter Be prepared the regular menu is a la carte The chef specials are a much better deal Or Henrietta s also offers a 2 or 3 course special which is a good deal If and when the weather ever changes to non soggy in Cambridge head on over for dinner or drinks and appies on the beautiful outdoor patio 
0yZPFcEQeZTEGDei3-WyTw CMU I didn t know where my lovely Boston hostess and I were headed and as we passed in front of Green Street I noted that it looked pretty cool Unassuming brick exterior with small windows revealing a calmly lit dining interior So when she opened the door I was excited about going in and checking it out The decor has a clean stylish look with soft green walls and dark hardwood floors Although it was a Friday night we were greeted warmly seated quickly and service continued to be attentive and prompt throughout our meal The menu has a good selection of appetizers and entrees that all sounded wonderful and not too pricey for how gourmet the options were how nice the place looked and the quality of service The wine menu was pretty impressive a great selection styles from different regions US and foreign and at good prices per glass They had my favorite wine Touraine sauvignon blanc which is always a big big positive in my book The drink list was pretty long and creative and the bar area was packed so it also seems like a good place for just drinks too I got the baked mac n cheese with peas carrots and bacon It was pretty good but was a bit pasty and could have used more seasoning I was surprised that it came with a big ol piece of braised pork belly fat that I couldn t bring myself to eat Maybe I m just inexperienced in the ways of eating hunks of lard because the waiter seemed proud of it but that s how I roll All in all I really enjoyed this place but have to give it 4 stars for the lackluster mac n cheese I m definitely going back to try one of their other entrees next time I m in Boston 
0ZdC_ZJux1Ut_j2EOeBSpA CMU I m going to try something kind of different here because I felt like there were ups and downs with our brunch series experience So some fun with ratings and weighting and statistical wackiness Service 4 stars Grafton Street was incredibly accommodating considering that our original reservation apparently didn t go through I put in for 9 and they were able to put a table together for us On top of this they sat us and were patient though we were staggering in over the course of an hour Furthermore when the manager came to talk to us to have us move after it became apparent that we were going to have no more than 6 he wasn t demanding or upset just asking As for the waiter he was nice enough though he was kind of missing at points But overall this part was quite good Ambiance 4 stars On the outside I kind of feel like it s comparable to the Taverns on the Square that sort of hey look at me I m a restaurant that can open our windows sort of thing The one primary difference is that the restaurant is spread out like a nice restaurant The tables particularly the circle ones are perfect for exciting conversational wisdom Food 2 5 stars Here come my issues with Grafton Street the food is okay but it s not remarkable Brunch wise I appreciated the pastry basket which did help the overall food However my special omelet wasn t up to snuff The bacon spinach cheese weren t well spread out within the omelet On top of this and arguably more egregious the omelet itself was way too salty I shouldn t be able to overwhelmingly taste the salt in my omelet As for the sides the home fries were okay but the toast was a little huge for its own good As Roni put it they were more like loaves Looking at these three requirements and weighting the scores to emphasize on the food being the most important aspect because this is how I roll I have to settle on a 3 It s okay and manageable and the service is good But that omelet is too salty 
0zdni7-AC8D9LLU052E20A CMU Here are the notes of my review that I started several weeks ago and never bothered to finish No flavor Cheeseburger with mushrooms and special sauce that was useless Fries were pleasantly salty but were mostly tiny niblets I d rather pay more and get better food The idea of fried banana cheesecake would be the only reason I d go back 
0zEegk1e2z-dMEHfauEu_Q CMU I definitely agree with Ina C that this place was ridiculously overly air conditioned I was freezing by the end of our meal This was not the greatest meal I ve had in the Boston area First of all we were there at a slow time yet our burger orders came out wrong Plus I m not really in the thin patty camp and the fries were just greasy I wish I would have tried the homemade frozen custard That sounded very promising 
0zIIMiHUDllvhDsnLEf0Eg CMU Had a cheese burger and fries It was good Nothing flat about them the buns were toasted just right I thought Not bad just your standard burger I would say Nice casual dining 
0ZS1oNeaNnqWZGCCGrmg1w CMU I came to the Upstairs for a birthday party and was sorely disappointed I ve wanted to come to this restaurant for quite some time but I won t go back again As everyone says the ambiance is wonderful but the food and service was beyond lacking We had a prix fixe menu for 60 pp 20 automatic gratuity and a 7 meal tax at a table of 13 Perhaps it s because the dishes served were not on the regular menu or they can t handle a large group on a Saturday night but for what I paid this WAS NOT WORTH IT Appetizer Sweet Corn Lobster Chowder Sounds wonderful doesn t it Too bad it was served smidgen above cold The chowder was so thin that it could have been broth and it was served in a bowl too large for the portion You had to tip the bowl to get any on your spoon My boyfriend had no lobster in his bowl and even before the waitstaff haphazardly lobbed the bowls in front of us they were a mess with soup all over edges Main Course Steak au Poivre Another messy plate with 3 different temperatures of meat 1 overdone 1 well and 1 medium Too bad the 1 medium slice had a half inch of fat on it Steak au Poivre is supposed to be a filet with a sear of cracked black pepper sauce However we received a fatty strip steak with burned black pepper and no sauce anywhere on the plate along with a fistful of arugula that wasn t dressed The best thing on the plate was the half mash of crispy potatoes That was very good Dessert Trio of Sorbet and sugar cookies This item is on the regular menu and again did nothing for me The sorbet selections were lemon which was tasty and not too bitter pomegranate which left a strange cotton mouth aftertaste and pear which was at least to me and everyone else at the table who got it not appetizing The cookies tasted nicely but crumbled into a million pieces upon the first bite Service We had one main waitress that was very nice and accommodating however the runners couldn t be bothered to say excuse me after bumping into you when switching out the silverware for the next course or even say your welcome after you thank them for filling your water or serving a dish In all for 2 people we spent roughly 152 40 on food including tip and tax and 66 on drinks I left annoyed and very disappointed that I had spent that much on such poor food 
0ZYwUrRZ_eEVWyTWYJGBQg CMU This place cracks me up I liked it better when it was down the street but the whole time it has been a bastion of poseurdom The most hilarious part is checking out the babyfaced Finals Club undergrads in the window as I stroll by en route to somewhere else The food is mediocre but if you need to entertain someone who values atmosphere over taste you could take them here 
0_NI1f5ZP-WgLfBVJOOViw CMU Oh B side how I love you There are so many ways I love you The whisky knowledge of the bartender the quirkiness of the menu choices the friendliness of the wait staff The waitress was uber knowledgeable about the menu and helped us get an awesome meal I asked the bartender to give me something good from the many whiskies they have he shared his favorite with me The food was prepared excellently and tasty The b side is so unassuming It whispers to you we do it the way we do because it s better If you re looking for pretense look elsewhere Go for dinner stay for drinks Rinse repeat 
0_q4OTb9JnlXIC9ds5GeYA CMU Fantastic food at great prices New favorite in Harvard Sq 
0_zEHcIi4Lp4A9EKTS36Og CMU As much as I like Veggie Planet in Harvard Square it s so nice to have another option for vegetarian food in Cambridge A friend and I ate dinner at Veggie Galaxy on Friday night It was packed so the hostess expected us to wait 30 45 minutes but the wait ended up being shorter than that It was worth the wait My friend ordered the Brown Cow float and vegetable pot pie and I ordered a peanut butter and chocolate frappe and the Mass Ave Both of our dishes and both of our drinks were tasty Plus the portions were large enough to warrant taking some of the food to go I was thinking of the food and frappe so much the next day that I ordered takeout from Veggie Galaxy that evening The second time I ordered the vegan egg and cheese sandwich with a side of seitan chorizo and the Zebra frappe None of the above disappointed me So far I ve only ordered food of their breakfast menu they serve breakfast all day Maybe I ll try their dinner menu for next time With that said if you re looking for pizza Veggie Galaxy doesn t serve any Go to Veggie Planet instead Veggie Galaxy even says that on its own menu 
10QGOaGKtAU-wJTvtPVKbg CMU The food here is great Didn t have any problem ordering a vegan meal just make sure to say you are vegan and the people working there know what is up They were out of a lot of stuff when I went but I understand that as the place is new and they were extremely busy I m sure it won t be a problem for long Service was great My only complaint is that the portions were pretty small I went with 6 other people and only one person s meal was the size I would have expected it to be Everyone else s was pretty tiny For example One of us ordered pancakes and for the price I would have expected like 3 plate size pancakes but instead we got 3 or 4 pancakes the size of the lid of a average tin can Kind of cheap would have been nice to know that because the place doesn t really seem gourmet or anything from the outside I hope that in the future they will offer bigger portions but the food is really delicious So i will be back for sure 
10rFSCTgBfntyKGvpnMUIA CMU My wife and I went there on a Sunday night she won a dinner for two there in a drawing I ordered the rock crab and corn chowder for an appetizer and she had the grilled portobello as her appetizer We each had the pulled lamb shank for our entree I didn t notice any actual corn in my chowder which seemed a little odd but it tasted fine and my wife enjoyed her portobello appetizer The pulled lamb shank which was essentially a stew was a nice hearty choice for a cold night Maybe just a tad saltier than I would have preferred but overall very good Dessert for me was the hazelnut cheesecake with pear compote while my wife tried two cheeses from their cheese menu The cheesecake was excellent and my wife was pleased with her cheeses Homey atmosphere especially considering that this is restaurant in a hotel Our server was very good she was helpful with suggestions and very attentive Portion sizes aren t huge compared to the prices plan to pay 100 for dinner for two and don t expect to leave with leftovers If your goal is to leave feeling overstuffed then this probably isn t the place for you Before dinner I ordered a Manhattan on the rocks It was well made and large though the 11 price tag was a little higher than I expected We ll probably go back sometime even though we don t have a free meal 
13cVZOSovleZmjyY5c7i5Q CMU You could easily miss Green Street if you weren t looking for it However you should definitely NOT miss Green Street This hidden restaurant truly is a little gem The bartenders are fantastic and make some great drinks The food is a hit and several people have mentioned that this joint serves the best burger around Their mac cheese is killer too Hop into Green Street for just drinks and end up staying for dinner 
13W5RtZixduDbQCqJhRQbA CMU Visited Rendezvous with a friend after visiting with a group of youth to see the chef s rooftop garden What a cool ingenious setup he had on his rooftop Check out his blog to see some pics http www rendezvouscentralsquare com category blog Steve the chef was so generous and kind in his tour of his restaurant and garden so I knew I definitely wanted to come back and try the food Overall really good atmosphere waitstaff food We had the tapas menu on Monday nights Squid with arroz negro which was yummy rice as black as the night and tender squid with a smoky grilled flavor Roasted cauliflower and pinenuts great nutty flavors Muhummara a tomato based pesto of sorts with great Indian ish spices The bread basket was really tasty And we also got the lemon buttermilk pudding with huckleberry sauce for dessert on the chef Lots of yumminess A little bit on the salty side with some of the dishes but great flavors Indian spices and great portion size Will definitely go back to check out the other dishes 
13xO2YnZviGosT1eFkrqqQ CMU I did not have a proper meal the time that I was there and I can t recall while I think I was at the time too exhausted to eat But I sat there and was enthralled The decor is not that bland Boston crap epitomized by fugly Finale It s a jewel A really precious emerald ruby sapphire one 
14JWSif5v0d-pdvyvVKmGA CMU The Red House is great in both the winter and summer In the winter you can sit in the bar area next to a roaring fire and sip cocktails whilst in the summer you can sit on the deck and sip cocktails no alcoholic beverages with food only restrictions here it s a private deck hurrah Oh and the food is great too sort of contemporary American meets European and I love that most of the main courses are also available as half portions Whenever we re out and about in Harvard Square my husband and I always seem to end up in the bar or on the deck nibbling at olives and drinking martinis As a side note my husband and I decided to hold our rehearsal dinner here and we couldn t have had a better evening there was something to suit everyone and the service was impeccable 
165KYkrZnDWLYPY1dYk3jg CMU We were in the mood for some good food and some fun Wow did we have both Being a large group 9 we started off with their small plates and shared Great way to start off The Egg in a Jar was fabulous but crispy chicken skin amuse bouche with malt vinegar aioli is my new guilty pleasure who hasn t pulled a bit of the skin off the roasted chicken as it comes out of the oven Their drinks are fabulous and there were raves about the beer choices The dinners were cooked to perfection and the desserts were simple and satisfying just what was needed to cap off a delightful and fun evening We cannot wait to try West Bridge for lunch and are already planning our next visit 
173lXjcCs8B4GgCWYuiD5Q CMU The first time I went here for my girlfriend s coworker s birthday I had a great time The second time I went back I was not nearly as enthused I ordered a bourbon neat I think the waitress heard BOURBON 1 11 1 NEAT What came out was a rocks glass filled to the top with ice and boubon that became so watered down that it looked like a glass of iced tea When she placed it on our table I mentioned how I ordered the drink neat not on the rocks and she had a puzzled look on her face thus proving she had no idea what I meant Look if a bar had an extensive scotch and bourbon menu at least know what the term neat means I said that I could live with the drink as is but I immediately regretted that and sent it back When she came back with my drink as ordered it was less than a half pour of bourbon I can handle a mix up on the drink order but really spiting me with less booze is a no no especially when I am already paying a 30 premium on what I ordered since this bar tries to be slightly upscale in atmosphere and thus price x 4 With so many other great choices in Harvard Square I won t be back 
18chGDnTx-Px_xstrleXyw CMU I LOVE this place The first time I went I wasn t that impressed seemed like a lot of meat and potatoes to me Then I went back and tried the fresh side dishes a salad and soup When butternut squash is in season you must order it it s out of this world The salads are all delicious combination of greens nuts and cheese The pumpkin soup is amazing And the meat dishes are pretty solid too Plus the bathrooms are super nice since it s in the Charles hotel Seating can get tight when it s crowded but the waiters waitresses deal with it well 
18d4vJQkIdb0Ja1OhZz7aw CMU Comfortable lively yet quiet atmosphere Good comfort food 
18W8Nks8d2n4AQCuPoQlSQ CMU LOVE finale The desserts are totally worth 8 But the very best dessert is those delicious chocolate cookies It is very possible they will be sold out when you go though One problem every and I mean 3 times time I try to go to eat a meal there the fire alarm has gone off and we had to evacuate I m serious this has happened THREE times It is the strangest thing So I can t tell you how the non dessert food is 
1a10nZhAwtNlisDqYewjAg CMU Braved the first snow on Saturday night and sat at the bar with a friend for dinner and drinks First of all the view of the snow through the front windows was beautiful Love the art installations on the back wall as well This place just has a lot of character The cocktails were yummy our two bartenders were really sweet and helpful and impressed us with their skills on the raw bar Speaking of which they serve the largest shrimp imaginable here We re talking shrimp as big as your hand Lots of corny shrimp jokes abounded 
1AN08K4n6_OA5KRsizMjtA CMU Harvard Club is a privilege Feels cerebral elegant My mother in law is a Professor and we dine here frequently It s a lovely historical building Typically there s a large lily bouquet when you walk in the door making the entrance smell heavenly Dinner or Brunch are both great options I highly suggest the oysters Super fresh with a great sauce Also try the apple tart The crust is flaky Yum Only negative my water glass and spoon were both filthy during my last visit Service can be spotty as well Example waiter trying to take food order before wine and water If you get a chance go 
1AqvyP3h2mDPJyX3X2Ip0A CMU Greasy goodness My BF and I were looking for a good greasy hamburger place because we wanted some serious hamburger and french fries goodness The bad reviews on this place said that it was too greasy so we thought it would be a great place for us to lunch And oh it was There is not much seating though so beware The fries are pretty good but the french fries are better The bottled sodas aren t cold so go with a fountain drink I got the regular burger and he got a double The grease dribbled down my chin and soaked the bun PERFECT 
1bTKgS0FpwBCt-E2GaNnoQ CMU My brother suggested this place as a relaxing place to get breakfast in Harvard Square He definitely was right about the atmosphere It didn t feel frenzied at all and it had lots of light coming in through the windows We shared a fresh fruit platter as a starter and I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings The quality of the fruit was pretty good and in addition to the usual fruit plate suspects like cantaloupe sliced orange and honeydew there were also some surprises red currant and dried dates I didn t like the latter but it was still novel I had a bowl of cheesy grits and a buttermilk biscuit The biscuit was huge and nicely crusty on the outside and tender on the inside The grits could have been seasoned more even though it had a decent amount of shredded cheddar on top Now this isn t firsthand but apparently the ham served here from Harrington s of Vermont is a family favorite Ham lovers do what you will with that bit of information While this was a pleasant dining experience I think I ll save any future visits for when my family visits from out of town and craves ham 
1bz7b6PoiMWua25ivDS99g CMU The food at Russell House Tavern is delicious They accomplished what Green Street did not a crispy fried poached egg that was oozy and amazing in the middle Oozing over the toasted brioche and the pancetta and the amazing aioli The same aioli that was scraped clean off my plate with an extra piece of bread If plate licking was socially acceptable I would have The Andria burrata mission figs and garlic was the perfect combo of sweet and savory Perfect for sharing Figs on a pizza a revelation This was my first experience with figs aside from jam the verdict Figs Figs Figs Delicious Rounding out the eats spiced ginger cake It didn t look like much but layered with coffee buttercream it was heavenly A great texture and a really delicate flavor Yum The bevvies are in a class of their own I had been planning on drinking beer but after perusing the cocktails I changed my mind quickly I had the Battle of Trafalgar Pimms St Germain delightful Sweet and so so good I had a quick sip of the Wigglesworth So so nice Loved the atmosphere we sat at some high tops in the upstairs bar area The service was great our server was super adorable Can t wait to go back 
1cg2W8xPV6DKn0eLgCtu7w CMU Is it a pub Is it a bistro Not sure A bit schizophrenic Came to stay in Harvard Square for a business trip and actually ended up eating here twice The first time was for brunch which was actually pretty good Either that or I was simply just ravenous after landing from my redeye I ordered a huge omelet with home fries and toast Can t really go wrong with that The service was only so so Perhaps my server just flew in on a red eye as well Then I went for dinner the next night with a group of 15 Kudos to our server who was super chill and patient For dinner the food is expensive and not that great That s when I was confused if this place was meant to be a fancy place due to the fancy prices Can t imagine the students around the area digging this place at least for dinner but that s just me 
1cuHSl4GrQY7w5ElQ0xQuw CMU This review is specifically for the weekend brunch which is very underrated The Bow Street Breakfast eggs potatoes meat bread fruit is under 10 and Grafton s coffee is surprisingly excellent Lavazza And never a long wait 
1d4SX51Ntw76vLHH2xZQ_g CMU Had dinner here a couple of weeks ago with my brother his girlfriend and a friend of mine For a starter we had the tuna and avocado tartare This was nice and light Great for the summer time and pretty tasty For dinner Friend had the roasted chickpea burger It comes folded in a piece of naan I had a piece and it was pretty good I had the grilled scallops Scallops were well cooked and came out juicy and in a bed of delicious butternut squash puree My brother had the salmon he said it was pretty good I didn t try any His girlfriend ordered a BBQ chicken pizza It came on top of a wood board which I felt was a nice touch It s pretty big for a personal pizza and would act as a good starter among 4 people In summary it didn t blow me away but it s a great place to catch a casual dinner in Harvard Square 
1fTTrcD2KI2WXYsosZCSIQ CMU 3 20 for a floppy cheeseburger McDonald s does them for one third of that price so is Flat Patties cheeseburger 3 times better No Maybe only twice as good and twice as good as a McDonald s cheeseburger is NOT a compliment I appreciate the sentiment of trying to run an alternative burger fast food joint but bland buns thin low quality patties and not much else is not going to win you any fans This is way way behind Kenmore Sq s U Burger And it s in a food court too never a good sign 
1gVA6C2luf25BVCmicU52Q CMU My roommate s Englishness is really rubbing off on me As much as he abhors American English I embrace Britishisms like brilliant absolutely brilliant and you want to splurge but save money at the same time What bollocks Should really keep the Masterpiece Theatre programming to a minimum though although who could blame you if PBS was your English teacher Be thankful my reviews don t digress ala Sesame Street or Mr Rogers although Service was impeccable the food wine pairings delectable the bathrooms spa like and comes with complementary views of the bar and kitchen An order of the chef s tasting will allow you to sample virtually everything on the menu rearranged as he sees fit 2 dessert plates included But if you want duck call ahead they only keep a couple on hand each night but will reserve one just for you Brilliant brilliant brilliant It s just simply brilliant when you can end an evening licking black salt off your plate 
1H-UlchnynKOg9fVh_d0Ow CMU The rush of pre theater goers seemed too much for a restaurant that should have the routine down flawlessly We were asked to order our food within minutes of arriving yet our drink orders were not asked for till nearly 30 minutes after sitting I ordered the sirloin medium rare and it was served a shade more than well A true measure of the flow of a kitchen is the simple but not easy presentation of steak cooked appropriately My suggestion is to double the staff both on the floor and in the kitchen 
1hJdetgdFXcS5H9iht-qAA CMU Unquestionably the best restaurant at which I have dined in Boston Both in absolute terms and at this price point Full stop The atmosphere is comfortable and unpretentious and the staff are both knowledgeable and interested in discussing the details of the food that they are serving It is very much a place where foodies feel at home yet a mere culinary mortal such as your truly did not feel condescended On the contrary the emphasis on fresh local ingredients inspired me to search out new varieties of produce at my neighborhood farmers market For wine we had the controversial carignan It was very bright as warned but excellent for what it was We ordered over half the menu in small plates Everything was excellent Most enjoyable were the mushroom salad fresh hen of the woods mushrooms are great this time of year scallops burnt eggplant puree was a nice combination and the lamb shoulder turnip puree was amazing addition Bondir truly puts to rest the stereotype of New England as a wasteland of bad expensive produce Who knew local food could taste so good 
1I7STAgQtq7J-qZg5y7f_A CMU I had been hoping that this place would be slightly cheaper kind of like the restaurant equivalent of getting a haircut at a beauty school Nonetheless the food is tasty 
1IquqNpvYNOziBqubkoKFQ CMU Go once and don t go again Preferably you will be in high school when you go for the first and only time so as to get it out of your system early This place is a souped up and over priced cafeteria essentially It even starts to feel a little like a cafeteria after an hour or so You get to pick your own stuff yeah yeah yeah which is kind of fun see above go once recommendation but the final product is not spectacular and certainly not worth the money for a second round With drinks and any type of appetizer it s pretty expensive and you re really paying to watch the chefs in the middle of this big grill try not to mix your super spicey vegetarian stir fry with your neighbor s sweet meat lovers mix The biggest drawback for me No cheese 
1IyGJqT-1rSD6_lbYOVzog CMU After hearing a bunch of people say how good Russell House was i picked it a bit at random as a place to meet someone for dinner the other night because this is how one learns new things Walking up i was wondering if i might ve screwed up since it looked busy but actually we were seated nearly instantaneously Earlier in the week i was pretty psyched to eat something awesome and delicious but i was fighting off a cold by the time Thursday rolled around which sorta sucked Anyway other reviews have questioned the service but i didn t really have reason to it was prompt and courteous without being exceedingly friendly The beer list is very well considered and though they were out of Harpoon s imperial red the locally brewed double IPA they had replaced it with was smooth delicious and strong i can only assume that the wine list is also good The food was merely good and i was a bit underwhelmed Like i said i was looking forward to a good meal but i was feeling pretty crummy so i just ordered a pizza Despite being thin crusted it retained heat like crazy and was scorching hot pretty much the whole time It was clearly made with some care from good ingredients but it just didn t taste very good Other than that though it s a nice place to eat outside ish in a brick alcove just off of Harvard Square and that alone is enough for me to give it another try 
1j1iBOpkV_3lAqn-SqCl4g CMU The food here is really good It s simple with fresh often natural ingredients The menu also changes seasonally and incorporates food from local suppliers Last time I was there there was cheese from a local farm The atmosphere is nice and spacious and they have a good attentive waitstaff who are knowledgeable about the menu This place is spacious enough for larger groups and also has outdoor seating When I go I almost always get the salmon entree and it is always perfect The bread basket is friggen awesome too The prices are moderate I actually prefer this place to Rialto next door although Rialto is also good Henrietta s Table is much less fussy It s a great place to go when you don t want to make a major event of your dinner I often will grab a bite here and then head upstairs to the Regatta Bar and listen to some jazz 
1jaq_1LTRBEkWianSeD07Q CMU I ve been in here twice The first time was impressive until I got my entree which I wasn t that pleased with I had a very tiny portion of salmon for 33 and was disappointed in the fact that I left hungry after spending over 120 on dinner So I emailed the owner afterwards instead of blowing steam on yelp She was completely professional and sent me a gift certificate to go back Time to put it to use and do a review I recently returned again with my Yelp Kendall Passport and took advantage of the free drink and appetizer along with dinner It was perfect timing to celebrate an anniversary too For the appetizer we got the seafood sausage It was delicate and tasty Everything was ground up like sausage The bartender highly recommended it I chose in advance to get the 39 pre fixed menu The selection that night was a pate which I have had there before and was delicious Along with that I got the roasted chicken The chicken was amazing The best I ever had Super juicy with so much flavor My boyfriend got the pork three ways entree which he gobbled down For 36 he was a bit disappointed with the small amount on the plate after it it was just pork so why so skimpy It was a good thing I had enough chicken cause he shared the rest to feel full One thing I wish this place would do is add a bit more to your entree or beef up the size of what you get both times I found one of the entrees to be very skimpy for the hefty price The tasting menus look substantial but are in the 75 95 range per person I really thought the food was great however there really should be a veggie or starch on the plate to balance it out when you are already paying 36 for your entree For dessert we had a berry cobbler Again it was delicious and just a great way to end the meal Drinks were poured creatively Everything is carefully measured out and quickly replenished Service at the bar was friendly almost interactive as you watched them make some cool drinks dropping potions here and there It reminded me of Drink a little bit The food is very tasty and the place has the right customer service attitude Clearly there are some very well trained chefs in there For the steep prices though and tiny portions I probably won t rush back 
1jbZUTliZmSq1nMmvldTrg CMU Upstairs on the Square gets one star for their over the top Patricia Field meets Martha Stewart God only knows how tall Christmas tree They also get one star for their absolutely delicious Zebra birthday cake while it was not my birthday I was given the option to order this specialty which was nice The final star is for the general ambiance of the place It was definitely not my style but they put an immense amount of effort into the decor which is something that I cannot ignore Upstairs on the Square has a very Fairfield County CT in the 70s feel to it Like The Ice Storm I sincerely believe that one with the right sensibility and temperament and bank account and breeding will simply ADORE this place 
1jkhgNTuv0NT1vWDjDt_vQ CMU The best part about this place is the fact that you can just fill your bowl with as much steak tenderloin shrimp as you want Who needs veggies or pasta anyways All they do is fill you up or contribute to a longer healthier life Add a pitcher of beer and you ll soon forget all about the fact that you just picked your own raw meats fish off of a buffet and watched someone else cook it for you on a grill next to other peoples raw meats fish Chances are you ll be back and will repeat the process over and over and over again p 
1JKhPCebV_1gz3gLai6HQQ CMU I still dig this place The food has gotten better and Lou is still cute Haiku Review 
1JMI_sbJSf_4pnpxIXPeqg CMU Summary Excellent knowledgeable service great food Worth the price I came here with my boss and colleagues for lunch and the food was excellent The waiter was very knowledgeable with the menu and was able to describe the sauce how the food was cooked stuff that makes me feel that I can make a good decision between the rainbow trout and their special They were serving their special fish tacos that day and I ordered it The fish was very fresh and nicely fried People at the table ordered the rainbow trout and ravioli and had only praises for their food I loved the lunch so much that I came back for dinner with the boyfriend We got the ceasar salad on recommendation by the waiter True to what he said the egg was a whole hard boiled egg with a crispy shell breaded and fried on the side It was yummy We got the rotisserie chicken entree and the blue cod My chicken was excellently cooked the breast was tender and well seasoned I didn t feel the blue cod as much I had the coke float was average but the dinner left a great impression on me because of that juicy tender chicken I cam here a third time for lunch with a friend and we shared the lunch rotisserie chicken and rainbow trout Oh wow the trout was amazing I know rainbow trout is deliciously by itself but the skin was so nicely crisped I wish they could just serve me more of the fish skin The chicken was again excellent 
1JPHzAbCZHKk8H-afZAJjw CMU Yessssssssssss This is going to become an epicenter for Boston area vegans There is no other place in town that could serve flat beer and get away with a five star review Why Vegan brunch vegan desserts vegan milkshakes all done right This place is Willy Wonka s for vegans You can get a veggie burger anywhere but if you need to balance the stack of sweets with real food their burgers are great The Beer Battered Tofu thanks for not calling it a quirky vegan name that rhymes with fish and chips is the kind of dish that makes vegan brains explode when they realize they can eat something they long ago gave up on You know that giddy jumping up and down accompanied with maniacal laughter as they exclaim I can eat this that vegans do Half my party was omni and loved the food too so VG should have no problem luring in the After Middle East crowd if they do end up staying open that late Hopefully they will do all they can to rake because this place NEEDS to stay open Bonus Eames fabric on the seats The space is very nicely designed not hippie hokey Huge bonus points earned 
1K3P7mHqcY7DighpyULikA CMU We had our wedding at the Harvard Faculty Club and the entire staff did a superb job making sure everything went smoothly Everything was perfect We have also been here for Sunday brunch It is quite a treat The food is delicious and there is plenty of it and it is a great atmosphere usually a pianist etc 
1kCgDjlzHFoy1l_mS4Tpeg CMU Despite the faint fishy smell that permeates the place I kinda got used to it and my olfactory senses had habituated somewhat after many beers We stood by the bar then moved to a large table service was prompt Food was actually quite decent and the chicken tender was surprisingly tender under that crusty exterior 
1KDDTRVNlggWpAwevqGXnw CMU Eating at the Harvard Faculty Club sends a certain message And that message is I know a faculty member at Harvard who is willing to eat a meal with me The interior is pretty and not stuffy Rather than overstuffed chairs and people smoking cigars like in the Yale Club in NYC the dining room is light and airy The entrance way was filled with beautiful green orchids The food was very good I had the Roasted Beets with local micro greens pistachios and spiced yogurt honey sauce This was a nice serving of purple and yellow beets The sauce was light and not overpowering I followed with Seared Striped Bass squash and root vegetable hash and parsley oil Like the appetizer it was light and a nice portion size Not too big but it didn t leave me hungry If you have the opportunity to go I would recommend it 
1Kjk1NbCm_Zh8LefXufusw CMU Chicken roll up sandwich was so so though I have to say their 5 4 3 2 1 happy hour is a pretty good deal The 10 Black Dhalia however was not worth the high ratings someone else on this board gave Shards of ice in my cocktail Gross 
1L4QuTEAMZP20Y7i0qL8IA CMU ok i know some people love it others hate it but i love it i like being able to pick out my food and my sauce i can eat as healthy or as piggish as i please plus if you re a drunk munchie person its nice to have all you can eat after you knock back a few of their cocktails although it s been getting dirtier and dirtier the last few times i ve been 
1l4wyR6nLSRB4ruv2Rz-Wg CMU Enjoyed an excellent meal at Upstairs On the Square a couple weeks ago Happened to be there during Restaurant week hadn t planned it and ended up ordering off the set menu Appetizer was a small cake like preparation of haddock similar texture to a crab cake served with greens The sirloin was cooked to perfection small portion sliced and served with fingerling potatoes with crumbled gorgonzola Bread pudding for dessert was literally the best bread pudding I ve ever had Restaurant itself has kind of funky interior decor that stretches across several levels Service was just right there and pleasant when you needed it not there when you didn t Would definitely go again 
1m7aGMCAofDuDcm9lecFfg CMU This review is really based on the fact that this is where you want to go Before you go here you need to realize a few things 1 The waiters are there to bring you DRINKS only You ll need to help yourself to food It s an uncooked buffet 2 On that subject it s an uncooked buffet so after you wait in line for your ingredients you need to wait to get a spot at the grill and have your food cooked 3 And I stress this again it s still a BUFFET Buffet food is not traditionally good food The food here is decent but don t go here expecting anything orgasmic To sum it up you re going out to eat at a place where you aren t waited on the food won t be cooked exactly to your specifications and the food will be mediocre at best That being said this place is actually REALLY GOOD if you re looking more to have a fun unique time when going out to eat instead of a nice meal You ll make a few trips you ll spend half the night waiting while standing and you ll throw away quite a few mistakes But it ll be a blast inventing some new dish Good for groups or a date whether it s first or fiftieth It loses a star for weak ass drinks and in the end it s still a restaurant with busboys only I can t in good conscience give a restaurant like that 5 stars Other than that s all good baby 
1mt1pO6Yyte5wFEBdfE5Aw CMU I came here acouple of times for lunch the food is great lots of good lunch options and the decor feels very homey It is a local place in the center of MIT campus which has great lunch specials good portions and great for meetings Today I had the chicken salad on a bed of lettuce and tomato the chicken salad was dressed in a pesto dressing and the combination was great I have previously had the turkey cheese apple wrap and home made chips all of which I have enjoyed I recommend a reservation as service is a bit slow and unfortunately not that great Middle aged woman who served us totally seemed like annoyed that we asked her for stuff Get over it lady it s called power lunch for a reason 
1mtNLtqEbEXgo1_exNLPew CMU one of the best restaurant i ve ever been to food is fantastic and service is excellent unlike other restaurants servers at this restaurant do have hearts 
1my3lLJImijbPr5nJfrjyw CMU I travel a lot and on a recommendation from Yelp visited this location for dinner OUTSTANDING Service was great Atmosphere was good The meal was incredible had the coveted and much talked about hamburger BEST hamburger and homemade condiments I ve ever tasted Had a side of brussel sprouts baked with duck fat YUM Overall one of the best meals I ve had in Boston Pricetag for the evening very very reasonable wow 
1nCqM4iRq7UbyNuqrju5WQ CMU It s such a shame This restaurant is so cute inside and the server was super nice But the food is really not very good As in bad GF got lobster fra diavola and the lobster was fine but the pasta and the sauce were really underwhelming I ordered a papardelle in goulash which I was really excited about Unfortunately the goulash was really watery and underseasoned and the noodles were mushy Not soft mushy And this doesn t even go into the watery apple cider cocktail we went in the fall and the fact that I got a weird look when I sent back a beer for being skunked it was and I got a replacement that tasted fine If there is a redeeming factor to this place it s the key lime pie Awesome crust awesome filling Get it if you feel like salvaging the meal 
1NOC9312Ep7BrxSLfm063w CMU To start a 30 minute wait became an hour wait Not the staff s fault for the wait it was Saturday night but kind of their fault for not guesstimating correctly Remember it s all about underpromising and overdelivering in the service industry Once we were seated our waitress was a doll the bar we sat at had hooks under the table as all bars should have and the food was good if overpriced Note if you get the greens with your burger you will get a LOT of greens It was like a full salad On the other hand if you order the small place brussel sprout salad it will be so small you ll wonder if they messed up Overall delicious Overpriced but ok given the area Beers were also wonderful with a wide assortment Lively atmosphere could be good for drinks or a casual date out 
1nQ8xYanKUgk1WhD5tX2lQ CMU The food including creative small plates like deviled eggs with shrimp and avocado cocktails and craft beer are three reasons to get excited about Russell Tavern Plates are well presented and the kitchen does a fantastic job of layering flavors and textures My wife and I were there twice yesterday once to check the place out and see if we wanted to return for dinner with our son We had a friendly knowledgeable bartender The first thing he did after greeting us was to pour a couple of glasses of water We washed down aforementioned deviled eggs with pints of Harpoon Belgian Ale and a dark German wheat beer Both were excellent We liked the menu and reserved a table for dinner in the bar Fast forward and we re back with our 10 year old after his hockey game ended Dinner was Pt Judith Trace Trust Bluefish w Creamed Verrill Farms Corn Roasted Pink Eggplant Radish Salad 23 Ozark Heritage Pork Trio Loin Belly Shoulder with Anson Mills Grits and Sauce Vinegar 23 and Steak Frites at 24 All were delicious The bluefish portion could have been a little more generous Service is where Russell Tavern really needs to improve It took 10 minutes for our server to arrive then another 15 to get bread and 45 minutes to get our entrees after ordering The restaurant was busy but it was only 6 15 and that s far too long to wait The server should have come by to let us know what the situation was Instead I had to flag her down and ask when the meals would arrive Also the tables in the bar are much too close uncomfortably so There were six inches between our table and the one next to us I d give Russell Tavern another shot but I d take more control of the meal by insisting on better service Please let me know what you think of this review by clicking a button below Thanks 
1OiUW5KZN1OzbFMeshQw5g CMU Fantastic food and service Will definitely go back From the appetizer to dessert it was absolutely delicious Gold Plate 
1P3AdBAKWqO_-EiIoe-cTQ CMU Great Saturday brunch Food was great and the service was very good also I had the three course prix fie with the pork stew and my wife had the quiche both were very good Wine list was a little thin which means no Oregon Pinots 
1piIxTdIKS0cHt9-u2xfWA CMU It doesn t get much better than this place Although I have never eaten here the cocktails are some of the best in the area They have a 5 6 page cocktail menu with a great selection of sweet dry and sour drinks Also the prices aren t bad Between 7 10 for a cocktail They also have a great bottled beer selection with craft beers from all over the country It s a nice atmosphere and very low key A great place to meet up with a friend for a drink I wouldn t take a big group the place is not rowdy and definitely caters to a more subdued crowd Overall I love it Slam dunk for Green Street I look forward to going back soon 
1PXTcQJuMFXUhcdX4ibMFQ CMU I thoroughly enjoyed everything I tried at Za This place came highly recommended from a friend so I had been dying to try it Their salads are unique and delicious so are the pizzas We tried the avocado cucumber and potato salad I loved the avocado salad a little more than the other one but both were very good We tried a pizza with a medley of unusual toppings corn bacon potatoes it was absolutely delish It was gone in minutes The atmosphere is casual yet warm Service was friendly on point I highly recommend Za when you are looking for a casual spot with good food I ll definitely be back to try some of their other offerings 
1QOhDAGT_0pDpGNqB-MtHw CMU I went here for their all you can eat Sunday Brunch Yes they have a very impressive spread some notable mentions oysters shrimp prime rib smoked salmon and a super desert table with two types of whoppie pies even Also the unlimited fresh squeeze orange juice was a plus If you like traditional breakfast items they will also make to order your omelet and they have good sausages and wheat waffles Now the downsides The food tasted bland And it is crowded and noisy Not what I would call a relaxing Sunday brunch And at 45 per person I expect excellent food and a good atmosphere If you do decide to go make sure to call ahead and make reservations It s definitely popular but after going there I m wondering why 
1qTyFRMqoXBRDPCYwhQyxQ CMU Both Monday Club Bar and Soiree Room are EXCELLENT Chef Steve Brand is a very talented his food are outstanding Ask for Matt Reiser for wine recommendations he is the number 1 expert Staff are super helpful and very friendly Not to mention the beautiful Alice in Wonderland decor breath taking Always had wonderful experiences there for brunch tea and dinner Perfect place for showers weddings or parties 
1QYh1l_k7rnhb5N9i9WccQ CMU bizarre They gave me my wallet back after closing last time I was there too The food is a little pricey but I ve found it nothing less than satisfying I really enjoyed the mixed drinks here even though I m not really a hard liquor fan The crowd is always a good mix lotsa hipsters yupsters people in their late twenties relaxing regulars and enough groups having a good time that I never really notice if some scene has adopted this as their new holy ground 
1rZj3SUdV79dk7d1BMh7zg CMU THIS IS JUST FOR A CAKE Amazing place in Harvard square I got the Ultimate Chocolate 8 one for an anniversary and it was amazing It is little pricey but I think it is worth the money 
1sDSK_mhuQ2SInkDpr7HZg CMU Excellent The chef knows his meat everything is seasonal and tastes great You can get pretty funky things in this restaurant like Bone Marrow and Rillette I have to say I ve been to many nice restaurants but my beef was never cooked to perfection like it was at Cragie The color was unbelievable The meat was first class I suggest you end your meal with the banana ice cream dessert Trust me on that one I almost forgot If you are a burger fan you have to try one here 
1sPLVYMbDOq2gaBG8N-rqQ CMU This is a decent place to cruise through for a few cocktails especially as a warm up to your final destination e g the Reggattabar The drinks are tasty and the room is pleasantly dark There are times when disappearing into the folds of a deep booth and sucking down an ice cold cocktail is just what the doctor ordered Not your general practitioner he or she would be more likely to recommend improved diet and exercise to deal with the trials and tribulations of this world Make sure to pack your credit card Not cheap But good drinks rarely are Biggest downside I can recall is small capacity so it can go from zero to crowded in a flash Given that the setting is a well known hotel in Harvard Square there are always gaggles of tourists there should be some kind of special group term for tourists like lions are a pride or wolves are a pack flitting here and there and they can cool your date down faster than you can say suburbanite 
1SxOuOmmORoDjqEtXipoTQ CMU In an attempt to expand our culinary palettes beyond potato skins and pizza to be fair it s the wallet not the palette that needs expanding my boyfriend and I are on a plan to try one new best burger in Boston each month and Craigie was our first stop on the list last month To get right to the point the burger did not disappoint juicy and perfectly cooked does ANY place understand medium anymore with a side of wonderfully salty potato sticks VERY satisfying We weren t as moved by the sides we got marrow brussels sprouts but the atmosphere was good the service was impeccable and the crowning glory on the night was the delicious Pretty Things Jack D Or on tap An amazing beer Immediately the bf wrote his manager about getting it on tap at their bar where it has also been a hit Great beer and from a local Cambridge brewery what a treat Once we have hit up the other best burger places in Boston Radius Toro Flat Patties I vote we return to Craigie asap 
1twLaZlv1PtRwE02qq3dDA CMU Very Good Louder than I expected Parking is not free 
1u5z4YLkqnNrrR2DyQ6RAg CMU For a restaurant in this class Henrietta s Table is a bit disappointing The menu is generally pretty interesting and features lots of local ingredients but the result was not very satisfying My meal was so tremendously rich I could only eat about half of it The dining room was also very noisy and felt a little bit like a cafeteria I d certainly be willing to give it another shot because I really love this style of restaurant but my first experience didn t set off any fireworks 
1UnFDnWX6U142fUxaBF9hw CMU This place is great Small menu of artfully prepared food all of it good 
1vgpgH_Y6ld5DGlYI3yzPA CMU They were good but not great I ve gotten a much better burger at Fuddrucker s The service was rushed and the fries were not as hot as I would ve liked them to be The burger was also greasy It was cooked well and to my liking but any time I see my bun soaked with grease I get turned off The wait was also unbearably long I thought a burger only took a few minutes to cook I had to wait like 10 minutes Boooo 
1VkxbchjDf55uXrFYm4lfQ CMU Delicious I ve been here more than once first time was just for dessert second time for dinner I intend to go for a third time and beyond some of the specials they have sound great plus I would love to try their breakfast items It s a nice space very much like a classic diner with booths of varying size and bar seating available as well Waitstaff is on their game as well though I will say the second time I ate here the personality and manner of the waitress didn t exactly scream Veggie Galaxy to me didn t detract from my experience I m just sayin I had what I believe was the Kendall Square burger on a mushroom chickpea patty Every individual part of it was delicious the onion rings huge and flavorful the garlic mayo tasty the arugula nicely dressed with something the patty took all the flavors well though the sheer size of the complete burger made it difficult to eat Somehow I managed though Also I m not typically a coleslaw guy but this came with a killer red cabbage slaw I forgot to ask for cheese but they do make their own vegan cheese on the premises which gets cool points from me If you just have a sweet tooth it s worth coming here for dessert alone The first time I went with three others and I shared their vegan cheesecake with someone convincingly cheesecakey Also when another friend ordered a slice of lemon meringue pie the waiter mistakenly brought us two and when he learned of his error gave us the extra slice on the house The BEST lemon meringue pie I ve ever had bar none On a subsequent visit my girlfriend and I shared a hot fudge sundae and were pleased with the coconut based ice cream not to mention the taza hot fudge and the coconut based whipped cream We got strawberry and chocolate and chocolate is the clear winner here I wish there were more restaurants like this in places outside of Cambridge It s actually pretty funny just picture the types of people that would eat at a place called Veggie Galaxy in Central Square and then you walk in and there they are 
1VzcGJqtetSJ-fd3i3dqqQ CMU Overrated L A Burdick s has much better desserts for less money You pay for the hype at Finale The Harvard Business School grads owners of Finale were interviewed in the Boston Globe They said they d like to do for desserts what Starbucks did for coffee There you have it for better or for worse I m guessing lots of syrup will be involved I think the idea is great but it s hard for a corporate business venture to be charming or inspiring Seriously compare this place to Burdick s a few blocks away Oh here s a quote from their website Finale s mission is to be the universally recognized brand of super premium desserts just as Starbucks is to coffee Uh Starbucks is NOT super premium coffee This isn t my subjective opinion this is objective fact Starbucks is super premium syrups and super premium marketing Ann M nailed it with her comments about the dim lighting suckering people Notice that Finale is the result of a brainstorming session for a profitable business not a pastry chef s dreams Finale shows what s wrong with corporations it manipulates people through marketing into paying exorbitant prices for things they don t really want that aren t good quality for the price 
1wOFH-BFvlX-sFBX6UznTQ CMU Feeling adventurous Save up and do the 10 Course Chef s Tasting I believe it may be the best way to experience the range of deliciousness and inventiveness available at Craige on Main I took my parents here during their last visit August 2009 after realizing that not only the Elephant Room amp Cuchi Cuchi were totally closed on a Sunday night we showed up an hour before our reservation and tried to unsuccessfully find room at the bar Fortunately the staff stepped in and cleared out a bar table for us to roost in while waiting for our diner table to open up We were seated a little before when our reservation was supposed to start in the far back corner I wish we were seated closer to the window especially since all the tables were not filled but our waiter turned out to be awesome After looking over the menu a bit our waiter came over and told us about Craige and the options available to us After not too much deliberation we decided on the 10 course Chef s tasting which is about 125 per person Our first few courses were light and fresh almost entirely seafood based There was everything from squid noodles to a delicious piece of lobster salad to a plump juicy scallop They were all delicious but the next 3 savory courses were incredible A couple of those stand out in memory especially the Sweetbreads and Chicken Confit plate and the Lamb three ways OMG Those were seriously out of this world Our waiter was really helpful in telling us about everything on on our plate and kept the water drinks and wine coming for our table It was quite an experience Our dessert courses were so unique there were 3 of those one course was a tea infused Panna Cotta Absolutely amazing the tea tingled my senses and I highly recommend this if your are a fan of herbal light desserts We were also served 4 different things all in the same course each of us got a different plate and we took turns sampling each other s plates Out of that course the Taza Chocolate Mousse stood out as well as a Peanut Butter Ice Cream dessert that was out of this world I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to splurge on a true culinary experience The chef even came out to talk to us Craige thank you for an awesome experience vs just a meal I will and my family will be back 
1WOlsjs5xn9fESJADWBr_w CMU i m a carnivore but had dinner here the other night with some veggie friends i was blown away it really is very good indeed i made my own burger starting with the mushroom chickpea burger adding portobellos sun dried tomato pesto and asiago cheese it was fantastic washed it down with a cambridge brewing company amber which they have on tap service was attentive and friendly prices are fine definitely recommended 
1WOMO6pJ951gnse0yo_omw CMU Favorite place in Harvard square by far The bistro food is uber yummy and they can mix some strong yet drinkable cosmos They have some of the best calamari anywhere The bar is perfect for a happy hour and is often packed with young people washing down and away the days work One work of caution many of their tables are really wably so diligently protect that pricey martini 
1X-qnDwp06O-juxqNcBEXA CMU Very interesting and all natural and fresh ingredients go into the varied menu at Craigie On Main The bread was outstanding the entrees had amazing flavors and the service was beyond compare thanks Jonathan I highly recommend Craigies On Main for that special night out or anytime you find yourself in the Cambridge area 
1xBjyzVMYWm-p2cCo5Ekjg CMU Loved it I had to wait for a seat but when I got one it was at the counter I could not stop watching the cooks It was a total frenzy for them order after order I saw some burnt toast go out and some sauces and syrups thrown half hazardously on plates I was pretty worried but when our meal arrived and I had my first bites of the stuffed french toast pseudo chorizo hash and reuben sandwich I was truly amazed What Veggie Galaxy does well is their sauces dressings syrups The dressing on the arugula was bright and fresh the strawberry basil syrup on the french toast was sweet without being cloying and sauce used in the reuben sandwich was seasoned and flavorful All was delicious We got a slice of lemon meringue pie and it was wonderfully tart perfect for sharing since it felt very rich Conclusion Veggie Galaxy does vegan diner food RIGHT Hopefully they can manage the crowds while maintaining quality in the long run 
1Xig1IdKOgQ1IFKGOHlK8w CMU Enjoy this marginal eatery while it s still in business Future home of a shiny new bank or cell phone store 
1xzFROmIvBJgBz-AmgWAMQ CMU I was a bit skeptical about coming here based on the mixed reviews but boy I am sure glad I did It was warm out yesterday so the front windows were open and the whole atmosphere of the place was airy and relaxed Ahhh sigh Based on what my friend had said I expected the food to be overpriced and portions small and the service to be kinda shitty NOT what I experienced at all Quite the opposite in fact I ordered a Harpoon specialty Belgian beer can t remember exactly what it s called while my friend got a Southside cocktail to start Beer is beer I mean I love beer but it s hard to fuck up but holy shit that cocktail was amazing I was hungry so I ordered the burger Again another pleasant surprise Delicious and juicy with crispy bacon served on an English muffin Yes An English muffin Geniusss Service was good atmosphere was great and food and drinks were fantastic I will be back 
1x_t1ZkBBp2B4C_3WLsLkQ CMU There are two ways to look at this place one is to judge it based on the quality of the food not so great and the other is by the price great for the area Value is where these two factors merge and where individual taste emerges Flat Patties is a fast food place in every sense of the word and whether or not you like it is dependent on your tolerance or love of your standard fast food In every way Flat Patties is much better than your typical chain fast food place but it is unabashedly still fast food And foodies beware this is food for convenience and price nothing more I personally have a very low tolerance for Fast Food and found myself significantly less enamored with Flat Patties than my companions who have taken me The buttered brioche buns are a fabulous touch but it is the greasy low quality beef that fails to excite me the cursory not always fresh toppings and the unimpressively average fries that fails to impress Sure it s better than Burger King McDonald s and Wendy s but not much more For the price you ll struggle to find a better deal in Harvard Square Pinnocchio s is the only alternative that comes to mind and is a better option IMHO Personally I ll save up my bad karma from meat eating for something a bit higher quality 
1YUnnRa8oSayCOa9emUbVw CMU Pros Really good atmosphere very good variety of drinks not too expensive either Good food not just the regular bar food especially the pizzas Couldn t ask for a better location Cons Food portions were a little small and coz of that somewhat pricey But worth it Ask for seating downstairs much better they didn t give us the option so we didn t know we could sit there 
1ZAjKLPwYhKge8iRiA_TMA CMU A co worker suggested the B Side for after work drinks So of course I came straight to Yelp to read what others had to say about the place I went last night a Wednesday and now here I am with my own two cents The place was pretty dead which worked in our favor since we were a group of about 8 and we all fit comfortably at the odd shaped high top directly in front of the door So you are probably wondering why I am only giving the place three stars I just wasn t all that impressed or rather moved toward a feeling of Wow this place is great I guess I felt sort of just ho hum about the place since there wasn t any vibe So with this said I think I really need a second visit on a more busy night to see if my impression improves I ll be sure to update this post after another visit 
1zHoTUp6mpoIgKwCAFB6Eg CMU Finale is the place to go if you ve gone out with friends for dinner and don t want the evening to end but you re not up for the bar scene The desserts are pricey maybe more than you spent on dinner but delicious and filling This location has counter service as well for a sweet tooth fix and the prices there are reasonable I think the chocolate cake based desserts are too dry but everything else I ve tried is excellent 
1zIf3svXARjdLyEY4okRbQ CMU This place puts presentation first and taste second when it comes to desserts Sure they look pretty but they taste like plastic 
1zJdyb0mqvNhE-3xaaHwIA CMU I m not one to hit swanky restaurants as I m more of a beer and cheese fry girl but this place blew my beer socks off Though it s more of a high end kind of place the atmosphere is cool and relaxed and the food is worth the price They hosted my companies Christmas party about 70 people and couldn t have done a better job We had the place to ourselves and a personalized menu They go above and beyond what you would expect Plus it used to be a Burger King so it s already a huge improvement from that 
1_mjK_OpjGXMATtfYZM35g CMU I am going to based this review on what I ordered The duck and the chocolate pudding The duck tasted terrible but it was my 1st time having duck and the chocolate pudding was cheap looking I feel for the price it wasn t worth it but maybe I ordered the wrong thing 
1_oXI1s0-WF-j6iu5dgGDw CMU The veggie burger with carmelized onions and cheddar cheese is tasty cheap and you don t have to wait for it You can sit in a window and look out at the square while you munch on your fries and burger It s usually not crowded who knows why and there is a restroom This is one of my main go to options when I m hungry in the square 
1__NJmb0mxgbs5JFDKcFBg CMU The lobster ravoli was delish The atmosphere was great quiet but perfect for a Tuesday night date We sat by the open window and it was perfect Excellent bruscetta the toast it was on was so buttery I will definately go back would like to check it out on a Friday Saturday night for drinks and appetizers And the music selection is alternative which is just my style 
2-G-bN2sUPOVHCF3iml86A CMU This place is excellent You should just stop reading these reviews and go You won t regret it In case you need more My wife and I have been here a few times now once on grand opening weekend and a couple more after that Despite the huge crowds the wait has never been more than 20 mins or so Definitely worth it Love the ambiance here True diner feel with high quality healthy freshly prepared food Service is always great too incredibly friendly staff and always helpful with questions about the menu On to the food I ve had the grilled cheese and then the mac and cheese twice My wife had good things to say about the BLT as well The mac and cheese in particular stands out as my favorite Reasonable portion cheese sauce that is not too heavy pasta is prepared really well and a light layer of bread crumbs on top Served with a side of arugula nice touch and works really well together Also they ve got a couple Cambridge Brewing Co beers on tap which is icing on the cake for me I believe they have some wines as well but I ve yet to try them All in all highly recommend this place and am looking forward to going back again and again 
2-LCPeCerqTw3DDf3NNR4A CMU I had some sort of elk tenderloin at this place tonight not bad at all The meat was tasty the garlic mashed potatoes outstanding and the service pretty good I like the outdoor seating but have to ding them a star for not being about to serve alcohol outdoors I hear that this is a city ordinance in Boston Cambridge and has something to do with awning size none the less I wasn t impressed 
216xSFBZJTXf4ZgrrswMmA CMU Came here for lunch during that slow week between Christmas and New Year s We were seated and greeted by our server immediately I tried the Ghost of Mary drink to start which is basically a martini with a slight bloody mary and lemony taste If you like bloody marys this is a fabulous drink Lots of great options on their menu I ended up going with a poached salmon sandwich which absolutely delicious This will be my new fun lunch spot for sure Definitely recommend 
21AfXPcmSWEr8lliIOiLpg CMU My husband and I were a bit mystified by all the negative and so so reviews this place received Full disclosure We only went because we had a Groupon Now deal So we figured it was worth the whirl despite the luke warm yelps We arrived around 7 30 on a Friday night and it wasn t over crowded but wasn t empty either The ambiance is nice the hipster y vibe you d expect from a restaurant in K Square but cool nonetheless There was one waiter handling all the tables and he was run a bit ragged but he was quirky funny and extremely friendly far nicer than the average Boston area server We sprung for the 3 PBRs So far so good For food we ordered the siracha wings and each had the Seoul burger I had the parm and garlic fries It was all amazing The wings were the BEST WINGS my husband and I have EVER had and we are huge wing people I order them almost every place I go The sauce was delish and had just the right amount of kick and the fry job was perfect They re also served with some kind of cucumber wasabi sauce that was a nice and refreshing change up from the typical bleu cheese or ranch The burgers were amazing too The beef was local and grass fed and you could tell Super tender After we finished eating we liked the place so much we moved to the bar and had another drink We ll definitely be back again As far as Boston goes this was one of our best meals out food wise And even irrespective of the Groupon it was reasonably priced 
22Cd_9A2bzIUhdn15XsXDw CMU Great for late night food at Harvard Square I got the burger and it was really good It was wrapped in an english muffin bun and the burger patty itself was really juicy The burger is topped with bacon and chedder Delicious The pizza was just okay and nothing too memorable The salad was wayyyyyyyyyyy too salty Felt like I was just eating salt The service was good and the waiter gave us recommendations on the food and beer choices Speaking of beer choices they have a pretty good selection to choose from The best thing about this place is 1 Oysters after 11pm everyday I m no oyster connoisseur but the oysters were delicious in my opinion They didn t have a fishy aftertaste and tasted very fresh while going down easily Definitely get the oysters if you happen to be here after 11 
22GWKQBUO4Y-x95h-4852g CMU Had my second birthday dinner of the week here OMG This was way more enjoyable than the fancy steak place Our table ordered the 6 course tasting menu Mainly because I decided that is what I wanted before we were told that the tasting menu had to be for the whole table or not at all But it was definitely the way to go It was so much fun to see what was going to be brought out to us next My brother didn t even notice when the chef came out to great us and present the last dish to the table because he was so intent on the food itself We didn t try to make reservations until Monday for a Thursday night so we couldn t go until 8 30 The tasting menu was an event upon itself and we left a little after 11 30 very very full 6 courses was 6 savory courses plus a dessert And then they threw an order of the brussel sprouts in for good measure because we had mentioned that they sounded good when ordering Excellent food and excellent service We are already trying to find an excuse to go back 
23SrglNDN5WC0ig-sHDzaw CMU I love this place My favorite spot The food is fantastic delicious healthy local organic The staff is AWESOME The drinks are FABULOUS The decor is SO TECH savvy Love the projectors screens If you haven t been here you re missing out Come Now Especially great during after work hours with a great crowd 
256ucv5NwDgcgwSfltFymQ CMU Okay there s potential here But quite a few kinks needed to work through We came to First Printer for what we hoped would be Saturday brunch as mentioned on the website Instead we were notified that they didn t serve brunch on Saturdays and thus we were presented with the regular menu Nearly empty at noon the restaurant felt desolate and the waiters even more so It took a while for someone to come to our table and waiter didn t even write down our orders and trust me I am a very picky eater and an excellent menu modifier He swayed back and forth in an annoying way as if this job was a joke Later someone brought us coffee mistaking us for the one other filled table at that time We went exotic swamp bowl fried alligator frog legs swampbugs and the buffalo burger Buffalo burger was a four like beef but more tough and seasoned quite well The alligator tasted a bit like duck in texture but drier and tougher The tail was a glob of juicy and tasteless meatball Yet I am in no position to judge because it is my first time eating alligator But frog leg wise I am certified when little my grandmother could always get me to dinner by making frog legs And the frog legs tasted juicy but bland Can t beat grandma s cooking here I m just going to douse this in ketchup and eat it my friend said with reference to the swamp bowl When you have to douse something in ketchup to make it edible that spells frozen canned or dining hall food on bad days But oh the pinwheel fries Oh those fries Now there s First Printer s winning streak The check was not even in a nice cover but instead a piece of folded poorly ripped paper that was literally thrown at our table When we paid in cash the waiter took the money before we even left Beautiful atmosphere mediocre food and awful service I look forward to coming back and changing my rating But until then closing Yelp until I finish my exams 
25PNmULfVsSJPpjwr7W20w CMU I don t know that I m into the Gastro pub thing I didn t try anything fancy or the specials here which might ve been my mistake I had the roast chicken dinner comes with mashed taters and i subbed creamed spinach for carrots sadly I m allergic It was good but nothing special especially for the price If you can t or don t cook I m sure it s heavenly It is a nice little spot and I like that the hostess said sit where you want The staff were all very nice and helpful even tho I was dressed like a bum seriously i just didn t smell bad and hacking up internal organs from bronchitis I did get the nice little corner spot by the window all to myself I wonder why 
272m1IjvlYvIqRXdGMb4gQ CMU i would ve given it 4 5 stars if i didn t try the strawberry shortcake yesterday it was the worst strawberry shortcake i ever tried but i tried other desserts and it was pretty good i recommend finale if you are looking for a nice chocolate kind of dessert not strawberry 
279pT6lj5FIDz1i5qHIiqw CMU One of my go to restaurants in Harvard Sq They never disappoint Whether youre looking for brunch on the weekend out with friends for a great dinner or even a first date Grafton Street is the place Wonderful seasonal dishes and some comforting favorites like deconstructed fried chicken Yum Two words Just go 
27dAHZDKI5dXnv7_mmWoXg CMU First a note I ve never been upstairs to the Soiree Room which has a different menu and is more expensive so this only applies to the downstairs Monday Club Bar which is more casual and which I love My husband and I actually had our wedding reception there and it was perfect The decor and ambience is fun festive and memorable All our guests commented that the food was the best they ve ever had at a wedding everything from the hot date appetizers to the spring pea soup to the entrees to the wedding cake vanilla cake with lemon curd and cream cheese frosting In particular the hangar steak entree was ENORMOUS almost too much and so tasty that my relatives still talk about it even though the wedding was over 2 years ago The service was impeccable During cocktail hour the servers made sure to set aside a plate of appetizers for my husband and me knowing that we d be doing so much mingling that we d forget to eat When one of our guests broke a chair by sitting on it very embarrassing they had another one under him before you even knew it Another of my guests was a jazz singer and we asked her to perform a few songs during the early part of the evening When she sat back down she started eating but one of the servers noticed that her entree had gotten cold He immediately went to the kitchen and brought her another one without even being asked All through the night the service was attentive and unobtrusive right up to the clean up when they had all our candles and flower vases etc packed up for us and ready to go while we were still finishing up dancing We have gone back there several times and the food has always been very good if not great the steaks are always great and the prices are reasonable again this is the downstairs room I m sad to read here that some people have had problems with the service but we never have This is a really unique and special place If you are considering a wedding reception here go for it 
27k3N9f4UqK7sBBWO37iZg CMU No gluten free menu thats for you mom but it s a great new American French style menu A terrific menu Polite service in a unique environment We had the chocolate bread for dessert and although normally you finish here it is a great start and although dessert comes at the end it can be a great reason to come in My sister and i devoured this Henriettas is in the Charles Hotel So don t bother looking around for a street level entrance The food was great and if you are visiting and looking for traditional New England food with a little twist in a unique environment with good service look no further Or if you live here and need some comfort food in a great environment this is also the place The kitchen is open and it makes you feel like you just walked into the kitchen and you can see everything very nice Then when your meal is over the chocolate bread dessert is great They might have other great things but we can t seem to get beyond this great dessert Parking might be difficult but we walked here 
28krDD0oApKwOtu6JP5uUw CMU best valentine s meal that ever happened seriously never wanted to bottle my saliva to use later as a sauce before eyes involuntarily dropping shut in order to savor each bite as much as humanly possible craigie on main we made friends with one of the waiters Jonathon at another foodie convention and he recommended the place he hooked it up with a free round of drinks and also brought us a tasting of a new drink they re adding to the menu also it is ranked second in the nation in GQ amazing first amuse bouche oyster tempura on squid ink grey mullet crudo rillettes of arctic char the oyster tempura was the perfect bite salty with a hint of sweet the crudo was a little salty for my taste actually overpoweringly so the rilletes were delicious the perfect texture and smoothness second hiramasa sashimi w red onion shiso salsa avocado harissa rose vinaigrette foie gras au torchon with blood orange marmalade brioche toast i was a little bit appalled by the idea of foie gras but the waitress assured me they came from happy free range fowl and it was amazing the foie was rich creamy well seasoned everything you could ask for third house made rabbit and guanciale sausage lasagnette w celery root puree natural jus native lobster ravioli w kohlrabi puree herbs the ravioli was good but not amazing had better at Pazzo on Newbury definitely still delicious though fourth sika venison two ways three pepper crusted leg grilled crepinette with braised red cabbage creamy puree of potato and whole grain mustard this was seriously the must eat dish of my evening my eyelids dropped of their own accord upon the first taste perfectly prepared the crepinette was fatty but it was the melt in your mouth kind of ambrosial fat not chewy at all everything pared perfectly together i was hard pressed not to lick my plate elysian fields lamb three ways roasted loin shoulder confit heart sausage with artichokes beets dates and olives fifth blood orange sorbet good tang blood oranges are my fave so this was a great transition sixth chocolate tasting homemade smores macarons bourbon chocolate creme chocolate napoleon and chocolate dipping sauce okay i know i m a chick and chicks chocolate yadda yadda whatever i don t like chocolate i don t particularly care for sweets in general but i was blown away by not only the presentation but also the options on this plate i could have drank the milk chocolate dipping sauce there were two brioche esque crueller things on the plate too that were lightly dusted with cinnamon sugar and they were phenomenal the drinks were also incredible well prepared and hearty my azn glow was poppin off by the end of the night service impeccable might have helped that jonathon was clearing our table and stopping to chat but our waitress was very attentive and good at recommending drinks definitely coming back and soon although the refusal to let me see the bill and my date s sister s reaction to him telling her the price was a teeensy bit totally horrifying absolutely want to try the bar menu and the nights when they don t have only the pre fixe menu 
2aaQQBj-BH5MC4InNcO71g CMU Arguably the most expensive meal I ve ever paid for but totally worth it I d go back in a heartbeat well maybe after I ve saved up some more or if someone else was offering to pay Drinks were very tasty food was very tasty wine was very tasty An added bonus Chef Tony presented our final savory course awesome 
2AbqwCr91um86d9wP1oj3A CMU Bondir is a tiny little spot somewhat off the beaten path If I had not been on the lookout I would have easily missed the subtle sign out front Inside the mood is cozy quaint and charming Despite having such limited space there must be only around ten tables there is a little nook in front of a brick candle lit fireplace suitable for a drink or even a light bite Waitstaff was professional and attentive as soon as I walked in the door The best part of the Bondir menu is the fact that nearly all dishes are available as half servings allowing one to pick and choose multiple plates for tasting We started off with the house made bread a delicious 9 Grain a rugged Cranberry Walnut Spelt and an intriguing bread titled The Sea which contained whirls of nori seaweed and dried shrimp hearty and oddly delicious Having spent a fair amount of time baking my own bread I would rate these choices very highly they had excellent texture and the creativity in flavors and ingredients is commendable For appetizers we opted for the fantastic Mangalitsa 18 Month Prosciutto Ricotta Tuscan Olive Oil Greens Olive Oil Toasted Bread Crumbs The prosciutto was some of the best I ve tasted in recent memory and the toppings were light and perfectly complimented the rich intensity of the thinly sliced meat The Handmade Burrata Shaved Vegetable Salad Pistachio Vinagarete Aniseed Tuile was also excellent The cheese was creamy and the salad was fresh and crisp My favorite dish by far was the Aged Carnaroli Risotto Rhode Island Mussels and Periwinkles Lardons Spruce Shoot Froth This dish was packed with flavor perfectly cooked and flavors that complemented each other wonderfully The Herbed Tagliatelle Confit Duck Georgia Peas Sorrel Scamorza was also delicious The Roasted Mallard Duck Mustard Greens Black Lentils White Flint Cornmeal Cake was incredibly flavorful delicious and like all of the meat dishes quite generously portioned for a half serving My one complaint is that the duck breast was on the sinewy side The other meat dishes salmon and roast lamb were fantastic For dessert we had the G noise Vermouth Infused Tangerine Thyme Buttermilk Ice Cream Meringue Brul e served parfait style and Chocolate Panna Cotta Seville Orange and Rhubarb Cocoa Nibs and Pistachio Both were excellent The tangerine dessert was creative and fun and the panna cotta and a perfect texture Overall I would recommend this new restaurant The food was creative and excellent service was friendly and attentive and the ambience is wonderful The menu changes daily so there will always be something fresh and new to try A wonderful spot for a romantic meal or cozy meeting with friends family 
-3k_SrnUQrHDlbtrBv9wRA CMU Really filling Got the burger and was super satisfied The beer battered burgers was overkill Super tasty super heavy Decent price for what I got Really filling Got the burger and was super satisfied The beer battered burgers was overkill Super tasty super heavy Decent price for what I got 
-9MB5ttu0zsyooJ1QDDQrQ CMU I was blown away by this oasis of fantastic flavor The grilled stuffed pasta was so mind bendingly delicious that I tried to recreate this at home While the description and use of two sauces sounds like it would contradict itself each of the components blend marvelously in your mouth I sampled soups and small bites as well Over all I found the flavors in each dish are well balanced and don t compete for attention There is a certain finesse that s being used in the kitchen to render distinctly memorable flavor profiles The atmosphere was inviting modern and clean The service staff knowledgeable and attentive I wish I had one where I live and will absolutely be back when I find myself in Champaign again 
-r-EuQOcq0FKF8aJuURShw CMU The Hubster and I decided to do a date night try out Destihl and then go see The Exorcist at the Virginia our date night may not be your definition of romantic but that s neither here nor there I d heard about how crowded Destihl gets around dinnertime and never having been there before I went the AARP route and reserved a table for us at 5 15 to give ample time for slow service this was unnecessary I was surprised to learn that Destihl is cavernous There was absolutely no shortage of tables How does it ever get crowded Who knows In any case we were irritatingly seated near the only large loud party in the entire restaurant Nothing like listening to a bunch of screechy teenagers dressed up for Homecoming say semi racist things and then shush each other on date night We got appetizers and small plate y things to constitute our meal All were finger food all were messy and delicious We tried the cheese curds lightly breaded crunchy thoroughly melty thai chicken wings a nicely spicy slow burn flavorful thick sauced with fabulous peanuts sprinkled over the top and beer boiled shrimp a tad too much seasoning that clung to our fingers and overwhelmed most other flavors not much beer taste but otherwise you know cold shrimp are tasty on their own I tried a pint of their black IPA which I thoroughly enjoyed We also shared their chocolate trio or M nage Trois or whatever they call it which consisted of mexican hot chocolate thick hot nom a chocolate tart delicious filling but with a crust that was absolutely impossible to cut into making it awkward to eat much less share and zanzibar chocolate ice cream heaven I need to try more things to be sure that this is actually a problem but I feel like everything on their menu is too complicated There are SO MANY INGREDIENTS listed on every single menu item Too many seasonings too many flavor combinations Every time I read something I was like Mmm yes yes yes oh no you went too far Our waiter was extremely enthusiastically friendly to the point of making us feel a bit awkward I mean he hung out and chatted I don t harbor ill will against the guy or anything he was really nice but you know I m on a date with my main squeeze please leave Considering all the stuff we got our tab was surprisingly cheap I think we were out for under 30 I waffled between 3 5 and 4 stars but I m feeling generous today 
-UEpk7rjYp1cNQfAvQUFkg CMU It is similar to Flat Top Grill which has been a campus favorite for a few years However the atmosphere is better the ingrediants a bit fresher and it is NOT on campus which is huge for us townies It has a more up scale vibe as opposed to Flat Top s college student vibe I do wish they had some sample dishes good sauce mix ideas like Flat Top The lunch is 9 95 Sounds like a lot but the portion was large and if you do smaller portions you can make multiple trips for that price The drink menu looked intriging I think it d be a fun date place Some mentioned not seeing a vegetarian protien I believe I saw Tofu but it was in with the veggies not the meat section We tried the chocolate wantons and I thought they were perfect light and flavorful The waiter also recommended the cheesecake Speaking of the waiter he was incredibly attentive My drink was refilled before I even realized I was low 
0ALfpnFVyqVsbh9Com6eKw CMU What one would consider fine dining especially considering the fact we re talking about Champaign Bacaro s boasts of an extensive wine selection and the best of traditional Italian cuisine We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer and because I wasn t feeling very adventurous chose the oven roasted chicken as my entre Overall I found both these dishes a little too salty maybe the chef was just having an off night The portions are modest but you would probably expect a little more for the price you re paying They did have a decent cheesecake and the check came out with a couple yummy chocolate chip meringues but overall I guess I was a little disappointed In consensus with what many others have said service was very attentive but I felt it was almost to the point of pretentiousness Based on this experience alone I would most likely not recommend Bacaro s nor dine here again but I really don t want to dislike this establishment and would like to come back again sometime in the future and give it another chance Until then I say stick with Radio Maria 
0Dcs_JH7He66Gs3tktyL6A CMU Poorest customer service I ve ever seen in not just the restaurant industry but in any service Manager was unbelievably rude Will never go back next time I m in Champaign and hope nobody else makes the mistake of going here 
0EL-9OGj0HyRGIZ7wb3WGA CMU Bacaro is a restaurant that I would reserve for a special occasion or just to treat yourself to something a little different My favorite is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars and for an additional 25 you can get some awesome wines highly recommended The courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing presentation and you won t go home hungry I ve noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste actually they re consistently salty to me but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing sauces and the desserts so delicious the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly I honestly don t know a better way to start the week if you have a bad case of the mondays treat yourself to some bacaro and your spirits will be lifted I have gone several times and enjoyed several of the menu items and a few market nights i hear they re introducing an occasional VEGETARIAN market menu and i have never been disappointed The service is great and they are very attentive Some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation but overall they are a pleasant and fun to talk to group If you ask them a question and they don t know the answer they are probably equally curious to know the answer as well meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef I think you definitely get what you pay for and for a city like champaign bacaro is definitely a lovely gem 
0hnG1Zxkmgrv-SiLPwloaQ CMU Just tried the Prairie Fire restaurant this evening I went thinking that it would be TGI Prairie Fire occupies the same space where TGI Friday s used to be Since I was already there I ook a quick peak at the menu before deciding to sit down Compared to TGI the number of menu items are very limited it seemed decent enough and so a friend and I decided to give it a whirl I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla as an appetizer Pretty average nothing really to rave about But I figured that you couldn t get too fancy with a quesadilla For the main course I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and my friend ordered the Southwest Chicken Cajun Pasta The bed of rice with the Teriyaki Chicken was okay but what was supposed to be Teriyaki Chicken was grilled chicken sans teriyaki sauce Not even the smallest hint of Teriyaki When I requested a side of teriyaki sauce apparently they didn t have any and only used a marinade Anyway I was not at all pleased with the Teriyaki Chicken I would give it a 0 5 stars My friend ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta This was also nothing to rave about I can make better at home Food wise it was a pretty lackluster experience Not worth the 45 Prices didn t really make up for the lack of quality either The one star is for the fairly decent service 
0Kn1D6f80JbeHTiGnduflw CMU After a long work day my friend J and I needed some booze and sustenance and she came up with yet another Champaign winner Interior is stylish minimal and dark Our booth was large and comfy Our waiter was knowledgeable and just friendly enough Can quickly become pricey if you stay a while and dive into the small plates and drinks I was overwhelmed by the drink menu and ended up going with my old standby the dirty Martini My first one with organic corn vodka which made for a smooth sipping drink Loved it J tried two different drinks so I got to try them too over the course of our dinner both of which were delicious and pleasantly spiked with liquor We tried two different apps the Beer Battered Bacon and the House Olives our 2nd choice when we were told they d just run out of the deviled eggs The bacon was not greasy at all and the maple chipotle drizzle was the perfect topper The olives were meh just not necessary and I don t think my opinion was swayed too much by the fact that I really really wanted those deviled eggs Next up a la carte soup I went with the Beer Cheddar soup which was close to great with discernible beer and cheese flavors J chose the soup du jour Cream of Asparagus excellent fresh asparagus flavor here Both soups were wonderfully creamy Bowls were decent sized for 5 My entree was a Thai shrimp and noodle dish I m a sucker for coconut curry sauces Nice amount of shrimp but no noticeable spice to the dish A bit of a disappointment J s beer brined double pork chop was an amazing dish not to mention huge Perfectly pink pork We parked in a nearby parking garage as the lot across the street was full I would return and try everything new other than my Martini 
0kr30u-okifEGetnjNeWGg CMU We went for an early Saturday night dinner drawn in by new fine dining in the area which is limited and the promise of local farm to table style We are huge fans of many local farm efforts which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall and now Big Grove Tavern First the food from a foodie perspective Fresh product well selected and well cared for The flavors of the natural food are highlighted The preparation is often minimally invasive The technique is classic French The flavor profile is quiet My partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder For example the deviled eggs a pre starter have yolks mixed with peas We would suggest adding an acid note perhaps a pickle It was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks a feature at BGT The flavor of the night was white truffle oil and you could taste the oil That was a real win For starters my partner had the chili and cornbread and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb I think mine was better really delicious with rich deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through The farmstyle whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch The cornbread was a bit too refined it needed more crust and less cake more corn flavor and less cafe baked good sweetness The chili was savory but mild no real taste of chilis The entree and dessert courses were both very good especially dessert My partner had the short ribs which were beautifully medium rare not a hint over or under I had the roast chicken with dumplings which was amazingly good Crisp skin moist and flavorful meat with a delicious herb broth under Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still not at all cooked out The portions seemed just right not too much and not too little For dessert my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme Both were really superb refined flavorful rich balanced Nothing fussy just satisfaction in every bite with very good coffee on the side they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery a fine choice The food is not bold Or experimental Or imaginative But it is good very good much better I thought in terms of technique than Carmon s Bistro It s clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending People who don t necessarily like a chi chi dining experience will enjoy the food and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless Second the decor and atmosphere I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for although the dark colors dominate a little too much despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options BGT has a chic young vibe somewhere between casual and serious Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling black wire cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area outdoor party lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks one off note the planks have lumber yard stamps which may be a bit too low end for what they were going for fairly inexpensive light wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs if a bit flimsy and booth upholstery I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior There s seating outside too if you re a smoker or don t mind getting it second hand Third cost Yes yes it s on the expensive side BGT is fine dining not family dining I won t be eating here every night either Of course any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree rather than getting the whole shebang I d guess for dinner that this would run you 20 25 tops But if you have a deeper pocket that night the whole shebang here could run you 100 with tip for two and you still won t feel cheated The value is here given the quality of experience Fourth service BGT has a young eager service staff They took good care of us and every other table I could see From beginning to end we enjoyed our time here 
0N7nrpO4cNGBYbDp7Ap1YA CMU My date secured us a reservation here for Valentines Day Pretentious Server was snooty bar man was snooty The patrons also the same Crammed seating It was crazy expensive I understand local farm products different menus blah blah blah but in Central Illinois Seriously 28 for a chicken leg No thank you The prices were a turnoff and the food was OK maybe we picked the wrong dishes The whole time my date and I were staring at this couple that did the at the time 98 person tasting menu one YOUNG lady and a very old man and they were a riot so I guess we had fun watching them Other then that Meh 
0svlJAQuN7UcbSf-c5kIfw CMU Tried this place around 5 30 on a weeknight and it was not at all busy It did start getting busier towards the end of the meal but our service was good Luckily for me I had not been highly anticipating the opening of Destihl The beers were good enough There were about a dozen to choose from so if you drink beer at all you should be able to find one you like The night we went in we were given free 2oz samples of as many of the beers as we wanted to try I tried the Belgian Strawberry Blonde and Raspberry Wheat Champaign Blond and Frankengluten good flavors but none will be appearing on my all time favorites list The Frankengluten was interesting and worth a try if you are adventurous Our waiter was nice and attentive enough but could not properly give drink recommendations since he was not old enough to drink I thought this strange since clearly patrons are going to want to know about the beer The food I had the brie and portabello sandwich with chips The chips were average and the sandwich was bland That s honestly about the best I can say My dinner partner said his steak salad was excellent and it looked fresh and crisp but I can t vouch for the taste We split the beer battered asparagus and that was by far my favorite item I will probably go back at some point for another try The pizza and a desserts sounded like they may have potential Second visit 8 27 11 Finally tried the pizza pesto and goat cheese and still really no change in my review Nice wait staff but the food does not overly impress You do receive a large quantity of food for the price Although for me quantity does not trump quality 
0SzF2s9PDqpwHNiIxNJqFQ CMU Thursday 2 any pint and they have two brothers and dead guy on tap Yesssss Also their fries are probably the best on Green St and their burgers ain t too shabby either The only thing I can t understand is the ridiculously long line to get in after 9pm especially after the second bar opened inside ohwell grad students go early 
0vm21DGu4FbW8sZv4l3m9w CMU There are several restaurants here in Chambana that want to be like the Big Grove but this place is the real deal So happy to see it open We tried a little bit of everything last night and it was all very good as described midwestern classics nicely prepared with a twist or two We started with cocktails and bar bites split a salad main courses and dessert Our favorites were the cucumber y patio pounder cocktail tater tots and amazing sweet potato waffles Overall too I was most impressed with all of the vegetables which when they were cooked were cooked to crunchy perfection and beautifully balanced with spices and sauces It s ironic then that the one weak spot on the menu is veggies I m a mostly veggie eater and it s always a bit depressing to see only one vegetarian main dish the complex and creamy macaroni and cheese which can be made without bacon I m confident that vegetarians could put together a good meal from sides and salads and the lovely whitefish works for pescetarians like me But the chef is clearly talented and so I d love to see the menu rounded out with a few interesting pure veggie options Either way I know that we ll be back to explore further Next time we ll have to be early enough for my husband to try the burger 
12CJYDSsuinH9h8F-hAD4g CMU Yeah This place is yummy In every way The burger was excellent made us want another one Fries were great My chicken liver P t was soooooo good with jelly and the bread was divine My Mac n cheese was good and smoky a little dry but could tell it was individually made and good Bartender Lisa was enthusiastic and attentive Can t wait to come back and eat Might have to get back in here tomorrow Lol 
1BRgh6Wgh0v_vNveaJShBA CMU The Bread Company is one of the best restaurants in C U If you think that the reason why they are selling out of different entrees at dinner is because of poor planning it is obvious that you have never worked in the restaurant industry Dishes sell out at the Bread Company because they are popular duh There is no way to predict what will sell what night and if you are upset that dishes are out of stock you should be showing up earlier to insure that they still have their full night s supply As for the service being poor it s true the servers are mostly college kids that could give two shakes about their job but the food is so incredible it just doesn t matter to me The head chef Daniel is honest to God a pure genius when it comes to creating new dishes and I never order off of anything but the specials menu Trust me when I say trust Dan with your dinner If he has a hand in creating it it s bound to be amazing 
1CLE0burI_36WAC17NmpCg CMU Wow I used to think that the Burger here was one of the best ever not anymore I was in Champaign last week on a Wednesday evening Murphy s was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm I ordered a Mega Bacon Cheeseburger and fries Sat at the bar and had to ask the bartender if he could please wipe off the bar in front of me because it was all messy you would have thought I called him mother a dirty name Service here was terrible The burger Much smaller than I remember The fries barely edible they were like eating balsa wood that had been deep fried All in all a terrible meal I won t be returning not with all the other places in town now where you can get some good eats 
1ddGgTuA0FjA-u19f7N1lA CMU Have eaten here MANY times over the years from when it was just a panini joint to just the other day I think this place s most inventive time was its best time about 3 years ago maybe a little more Food items are less adventurous and price point has increased with time That said the desserts under their pastry chef of the last year or two have been TOPS Service I have always found to be very good and knowledgeable esp about wine I am curious to see how the metamorphosis of the former Persimmon Grocery into a mozzarella bar is CU ready wine lounge private dining salon will go 
1Jt7F0Ckwt2Bs8zxROf8Sw CMU Can t really state how much I love this place Hang out here a couple times a week as it is where my group of friends have always gone here On weeknights the place is pretty clear perfect for kicking a few back with some friends You often see people bring in laptops to do work over a beer or two It s generally quiet enough for that during the week On weekends it s certainly busier and louder but not unpalatable Music isn t absolutely blasted you can still have a conversation with the person next to you If you are here for food try the Irish nachos Absolutely brilliant 
1k5yA_gXkNZn_LLAt3ZIow CMU Generally speaking the service is good I ve had some bad ones The food is pretty good but the reason to go is for the brunch It can get crowded but worth the wait They make their desserts on site and make omlettes and waffles while you wait The meats can be overcooked but it s still all quite tasty 
1P-gfTAxaezPycmfkd4hXA CMU This is fast becoming one of my favorite places to eat The veggies are all very fresh The atmosphere is great I love being able to have a salad and my stir fry 
1YVnGVCj7cv14aXsbO3o3Q CMU Just your run of the mill fast food place Staffed by new people constantly it s not the best place to walk up to the counter and ask for a recommendation As far as Dairy Queens go though this one is just fine My orders have always turned out right and the blizzards always well mixed If you re looking for a quick guilty treat you can get it here 
213FXdSegrq22YmwsdWeIA CMU Hitting the big 5 0 0 with a great restaurant from my hometown The vitals Downtown microbrewery restaurant with a slightly hip industrial vibe Great food great beer Best part Small 4oz tasting portions 1 2 GREAT service Every time I visit my parents in good ol Chambana they have a new restaurant in town that hubby and I MUST try Or five This time Destihl was first on their list and they are so crazy about it they took us twice In ONE DAY First for lunch No beer this visit hence the second just lunch I had the Portabella Sandwich with Shoestring Fries and it was 100 delish Also on the table Stuffed poblano pepper Cuban sandwich Salad with ahi tuna Clam chowder I heard nothing but raves from the group Late that evening we stopped in for post dinner drinks and maybe a little to munch on We got three appetizers for the table Chorizo Potato Flautas Marinated Cucumbers there s some BITE to those suckers Brewmaster s Pizza yuuuuuumm and all got a few 4oz tasting pours The beer was fantastic some of the best I ve had Our waiters both times were friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the story my dad told more than once about his friend s first visit They were a big group 12 I think and stopping in before seeing a show in downtown They ordered food drinks then dessert There was a delay in the kitchen and they were kept waiting on their dessert for quite while they were now running short on time so one of the guys flagged down their waiter and told him maybe a touch rudely that they needed either dessert or the check because we gotta get out of here The manager came back a couple of minutes later apologized profusely and served their dessert Dessert or check and Destihl chose dessert Their meal and drinks for 12 were on the house It s those kinds of stories that spread your business name in the best possible way you chose wisely Destihl The guy s been sending over everyone he knows always prompting with you gotta hear how amazingly this restaurant treated me 
26WePdMt_GQuMZGfSCTmPQ CMU When I read the positive reviews on Yelp I expected to fall in love with Bevier Cafe After going to Bevier Cafe yesterday with a couple of friends the good news is that I don t dislike the place We arrived a few minutes before the cafe closed and they were out of some of their entrees The food we got seemed to have been sitting out for a while and it wasn t as tasty as I anticipated Also their service seems kind of disorganized you take a tray tell the people at the counter what you want pay for it go sit down with an empty tray and then the employees bring you your food Couldn t they just hand the food over the counter Or just have real servers Even with the not as good as expected food and the confusing service I like the concept of Bevier Cafe I m happy to support a student university run restaurant and I will eat there again 
2AdawVZPfmCtlwDXgfyUWQ CMU I can t help but feel this Restaurant has fooled many While I ve read the food described as Authentic Italian I felt it was anything but I ve been to Italy and this ISN T Italian I suppose the entire visit was lackluster The decor had a lot to be desired but the wait staff were great However once we ordered wine and by the old menu at least were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass things went downhill While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar When questioned we were told they asked for doubles Who orders a double Merlot We chose what appeared to be a special at the time a smoked duck panini What arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich No I m not complaining about the sandwich itself but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck then claimed that I wouldn t know the difference I m not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me but I ll never return 
2Ja-f64hX-wFjiWQVnv9CQ CMU I like it enough to come back The grilled Hawaiian sandwich is good but crispy borderline burnt tasting today Their tuna salad is really yummy They are pretty skimpy on salad dressings and a few times I ve had some wilty yuckiness in my field greens salad Nice ambience though and good outdoor seating 
2ji2h2cUDhZzTyAhXaDqKA CMU We haven t been to Silvercreek in years we were disappointed with the food Rumor spread that they got a new manager We decided to give them another try The Chef s Line Burger is best burger in town no exageration Even my wife thinks so and she does not like to eat burgers Tonight we enjoyed the appetizer buffet with oysters chicken shrimp salads artichoke dip fresh fruit and chef cooked steak on the grill delicious You must try the Peach Kuchen to finish your meal Silvercreek is now our local favorite If you haven t been lately you must give them a try 
2lLxkoZYQzFhVGIGhr5wjA CMU I was extremely disappointed by Bevier cafe during the 2012 summer On many occasions the food was inconsistently portioned or prepared For example the country fried steak on several occasions was extremely greasy with oil oozing off of batter a clear sign that it was not cooked at a high enough temperature When broccoli and beef over rice was offered take out orders simply were not portioned with enough food For a dish over 5 there should be more than two pieces of beef Items billed as hot sandwiches arrived cold with cheese not even partially melted As this is a student run enterprise let s hope that the Fall batch of students are more detail oriented and the quality improves 
2N1FEdeZtlPMKALiUJeHXg CMU I had heard about this place about 6 months before I tried it out and I m mad at myself for missing out for so long The food is affordable for a student on a budget and the atmosphere is perfect for a date or group outing It s the perfect place for students to bring their visiting parents too The beer comes in sizes ranging from 4oz to 16oz so you can try different brews if you re in the mood for that The Tomato Bread salad is absolutely phenomenal and I have added chicken to it and had that as my entree on more than one occasion This is one restaurant I really miss since graduating U of I and leaving the area 
2SudWi2937SYnbdS37HR8A CMU I had 2 different beers they were both pretty good I ordered the mussels Over half were not open I sent them back Second time about 5 were not open not acceptable to me The broth was good however I also had the pepperoni pizza It was decent My bf got the cod it was very tasty Next time I will probably try an entree It was very busy when we went but we sat in the bar Service was good 
2U5JgzZzGO1_TPqiAIK_3Q CMU I had a very pleasant experience here The hostess who sat us was very friendly and helpful The decor of the restaurant is trendy but also inviting and it is a comfortable place to eat The food was delicious and I had a fun experience putting it together I was nervous mixing so many sauces and ingredients at first but it all turned out to taste amazing together I don t think you can really go wrong when making it The servers were very friendly also and I would definitely come back again 
2VbfYqqxIQp0mk8G1ozU_A CMU I have been here three times The first time my experience was awful What I ordered was uneatable and I sent it back and asked that it not be returned We ordered the fried mushrooms as an appetizer and loved them The second visit I decided to play it safe and ordered a simple sandwich It was bland and I didn t enjoy it very much Again we ordered the mushrooms and they were fantastic The third visit was so much better I ordered the fish taco lunch combo with chips and salsa and French onion soup The French onion soup was really good They didn t throw a bunch of croutons in it which is a plus in my book The fish taco was really good too I asked for extra chipolte sauce which made it that much better The chips and salsa were OK The chips were good but the salsa was on the bland side I also think it is somewhat pricey for lunch If you are looking for a better lunch deal then go to Friday s where they offer a lot more lunch combos at a much better price I will go back here again Especially with a group so we can order the mushrooms again They are so good Word of warning though they are big and I think you get 6 or 8 of them You will need help eating them 
2VlWeAemTOxCUcehPRJhKQ CMU First the good 301 Mongolia has a cool atmosphere great selection of ingredients for their bowls and excellent cocktails Now the bad The sauces just weren t very flavorful My husband had to go back to the buffet several times to get more sauce just to try and get some flavor The roti bread was only ok Finally we both got bits of food that were not in our bowl not cool If I want Asian grill I ll probably just go to Flat Top 
3k0HVp_ntwg6khsLQYquFQ CMU This is a real gem Probably the most consistently good food in CU Lunch brings nice grilled or deli type sandwiches and there are veg options Dinner is much more interesting with pastas nice fish and meat entree specials and wonderful thin crust pizzas baked in hot ovens Desserts are also very good I am less into fondue exceot for chocolate dessert fondue but this is the place to go for that The ambiance is eclectic and European Families will feel welcome Service can be a little ragged sometimes a student group of 15 or large party will materialize and that can have a rather deleterious effect on service when there are only 2 servers on the floor which is often the case at night Even so I have never had a meal here that was less than very good and many that were excellent 
3Vm661aS08HuOhX1xsp_Mg CMU For Champaign this is the best food around I really appreciate what this restaurant is about good local food presented in a sophisticated yet approachable way The Monday arket menu is a great price too The staff is not pretentious which is always nice to see This is a diamond in the C U rough 
3zf1Ft1l4wbcaLHEKXjrcQ CMU Another time I may have given this restaurant 4 stars because in the past we haven t had the best service However my husband and I went here last night for our anniversary and everything was perfect Even though we have had some issues with the service in the past my family pre husband has been coming here for as long as I can remember probably over 10 years The food is so good there is really nothing the servers could do to keep us from coming back My favorite meal in the world is the cheese fondue sometimes with the tomato puree one of the yummy pizzas preferably with brie followed by their chocolate fondue I think I have strayed from that formula once I can t remember what I ordered I didn t think it was possible but last night all three of those items were better than ever We had the cheese fondue with the tomato puree this time as well as the pesto portobello mushrooms artichoke hearts and brie pizza it was amazing The chocolate fondue came with more fruits than I remember in the past red and green apples pears strawberries and some yummy little cake pieces The best meal I had all year The service was excellent 
4Nbk1pgc1zTEnzAH_vr0hw CMU We have been to Destihl several times I ve heard beer enthusiasts say that their brewery and beers aren t that great but the food more than makes up for it Everything I ve ordered has been great and the service is spot on I ve gone with just my husband larger groups of adults and have also gone with the kids It s been smooth sailing no matter the size or composition of the group Their kids menu is broader than most which is nice The regular menu offers unique dishes that have always enjoyed I would definitely recommend it 
4nhs1wVtfhZxs9nQvYBY2g CMU In terms of campus bars this is definitely my favorite bar to go to especially now that I ve been out of college for a few years Is it the best bar in Champaign Urbana No probably not but if you re in the area this is your spot It s super low key super pubby feeling and usually has a nice mix of hipsters sports fanatics and average joes The beers on tap are always good and remain pretty simple They always have specials too which is nice I miss this place 
4QQF0sRpugfwqQNhM1Moxg CMU This place wants to be better than it actually is The ambiance is really quite nice They did a great job restoring the building and the grounds It is beautiful and it was also the first smoke free restaurant in town I very much appreciated that at the time The food wants to be outstanding but it is only very good For as much as this place costs I want it to be better More innovative more spectacular The wait staff is mostly very young and not quite experienced enough to pull off the fine dining experience One time one of them addressed my dining companion as dude He took offense and rightly so We are not your surfin buddies we are your customers That said this is a great place for a big celebratory dinner with your whole family It s a beautiful setting the wine and beer lists are good and your grandmother will be able to find something she wants to eat So will your vegetarian cousin and her picky five year old and so will you 
4_aT1RB1nvjrOp_KOxw7yg CMU 4 5 5 Great restaurant all around Friendly helpful waitstaff Diverse and large menu of appetizers meat veggies seafood drinks desserts everything I tried the shrimp ceviche awesome summer dish swordfish delicious yet small for a swordfish steak fish and chips delicious as well and a cherry heffeweizen and a Hawaiian fruit beer to drink Everything was awesome tasty and presented well Can t wait to go back 
4_GcF1GlsVZuEWn840CCKQ CMU Excellent service They were very busy so the food was slow but they kept our mouths entertained with free bread and appetizers Of course it is pricey but it is worth it Food was excellent 
53xK3kogEIaM-AdcicOk6A CMU We were here over the weekend and its a really nice spot we didn t really order food except for some garlic bread which was cool We went there for their beer since afterall they are a brewery 1 25 for 4oz beers you can try close to everything they brew and then some I had 6 and my bf had 5 our bill was just under 20 They had pumpkin ale hefeweizen chocolate cherry coffee beer IPA s too many to remember you ll have to check it out yourself Can t wait to go back and maybe try some things on their menu Fun bartender too ask for Mike 
56nAPK0vNMvzkFU75PCRJw CMU My bf and I went with another couple to this place as we d heard great reviews The ambiance is wonderful and we had a very friendly and attentive server The food was absolutely delicious The only downside was they were out of the one dessert we wanted to order but I would definitely go back to dine again especially to try for the chocolate cake again One of the nicer places in Champaign and Urbana loved it 
5I11gSkkERvNkTwIXkTeGg CMU First reserve a table if you re going at a busy time and want to sit in the dining area It was my first time at Destihl last night I will probably go back Destihl has a great beer selection I tried about four different beers all of which were pretty tasty The appetizers were so so We tried potato croquettes and beer battered bacon The croquettes were run of the mill but good nonetheless The bacon was interesting but certainly not a taste sensation The main course were pretty variable My wife ordered the shrimp and grits which was far too overpriced for such a meager portion Though it was fairly tasty I ordered a Brewmaster s pizza which was very good The main reason Destihl loses a star is the speed with which we received our drinks order It must have taken about 15 minutes after ordering for us to receive our drinks Eventually we were informed of the backup at the bar I expect better though Also unrelated to my rating there appeared to be a large number of employees standing around at the greeting station watching other employees working This could be training then again it could be the reason some of the food items are so expensive for the product 
5IPyD0gm3Do_YkZt7zSS9A CMU Had dinner with a group of friends and felt the food was very over rated Bison burger was salty and the service was took forever Had to ask for condiments after the food arrived and drinks took forever Disappointing experience 
5liFFLKGQ8MFadpyTxZcag CMU When I lived in Bloomington I LOVED Flat Top I haven t really enjoyed the Flat Top in Champaign during my visits and decided to try 301 Mongolia Love it I really enjoy their salmon and crab when it s available We ve always had great service which is a huge plus If you re new to the place try it at lunch when it s cheaper 
5LzGiDm6UiIanTVerRyMTQ CMU Update I had eaten at Destihl a couple months ago and the best word for my dining experience at that point would be inconsistent Last night I returned to Destihl so that I could form a more definite opinion For my main course I ordered the Brewmaster s Pizza which was served with chicken andouille sausage ale onions and an espresso chipotle barbecue sauce The pizza was nothing to rave about but it probably would have been quite a bit better if a the pizza had been served hot instead of lukewarm and rapidly cooling and b the crust had been cooked all the way through My brother s pizza was also apparently cold and undercooked and reading through the other reviews this seems to be common for diners at Destihl who order pizza I think I ve probably accumulated enough evidence at this point Destihl is not worth the high prices There are so many better restaurants in Champaign 
5X04sZzRaeW6v9sgXiV93w CMU Awesome I went here with my boyfriend on our 2 year anniversary and we totally spoiled ourselves The food was interesting nicely presented perfectly portioned and delicious We had the chef s tasting menu and I m so happy we did There were things that the waitress brought out that I would have never thought to order but ended up loving more than the others I d definitely recommend this place 
60PQBHyw-auDK8hX9nV3qQ CMU Very expensive and not particularly large dishes If you re okay with this first statement this place is a great place The food is really good and the interior is very stylish Also the service is great This is a very professional place that you wouldn t expect to see in Champaign 
65GdDSU-Ak0x0M4x3hTaog CMU i love bevier cafe and i fear it may be my new go to destination for lunch over all the overpriced sandwich pasta shops in campustown you can get a delicious full sized entree for under 5 the ambience is a little like a dorm cafeteria but the service is efficient and the food is really tasty They also offer portable coffee mugs for 10 with 50 refills for an eternity after take that espresso royale on my graduate student budget it sure makes me warm and gooey inside to know that i can get real food and the elixir of life coffee at such an affordable price and in a convenient location sure beats my made in 30 seconds pbj for lunch 
6ehJhemy5z0bT8tuNCpFsg CMU Dined there tonight with my wife Shortly after sitting down a buddy of mine was walking out with his family I asked him what he recommended and he said he wouldn t recommend ordering anything special like ribs or a steak and advised to stick to something standard Upon his advice I ordered a French Dip and my wife ordered a burger on a pretzel bun with bleu cheese and bacon Burger came sans bacon and when the server set my French Dip down I cringed My sandwich was sliced Oscar Meyer roast beef with carmelized onions Swiss cheese and a cup of beef broth It was disgusting The burger was frozen meat and not good at all The appetizers were way over priced Place still looks just like aTGI Fridays but they moved the bar I think their money could ve been better spent elsewhere The outside patio looks nice but it s called The Spin Zone Why There is nothing about the patio that would make you decide to call it that name The only thing that was good was the Ranger IPA they had on draft It was icy cold and tasted great so I ordered a second one only to be told they were out Good luck Prairie Fire but I won t be back 
6GnxSqDsvEeUCzWPCqD9oQ CMU I rather enjoyed Bacaro It had a really nice atmosphere quality food and good wine I was impressed that time was taken to talk to my wife and I to find a wine to pair with both of our meals The pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals It was somewhat amazing also the fact that it wasn t a very expensive wine that was suggested This is a very good place to eat in the Champaign area The reason I gave it 5 5 instead of 4 5 is because even though the food is a little over priced in my mind the service atmosphere and location lend to it receiving a 5 5 
6orePKjc308e-l4Is_f0HA CMU I can t complain about the prices The food was expensive the food was good There was presentation to the entire experience which is something I ve found a little lacking since moving to Champaign I wouldn t want to eat in the bar area on a Saturday night and if the hostess hadn t been able to move us into the other room we would have had to leave My dad can t hear very well and his hearing is better than my lip reading The bar area is really nice and I d love to eat there on a Tuesday which I have The good The food Three people three different dishes and everybody liked theirs I had the halibut and mom had the rabbit and if you re going in there soon I d recommend either and even more I d recommend the vichyssoise with crab and asparagus If you re hardline vegetarian I eat fish then you ll have problems with the menu but I believe the waitress at least implied that the chef would make allowances prepare something else Either way you should call ahead and see I have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers perhaps they listened The malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice The bad Our waitress was new At least I hope she was new The service was great but she wasn t as familiar with the menu or wine list as someone working at that caliber of restaurant should be The manhattans were terrible I suspect Bacaro of being yet another restaurant who thinks they should have their own special manhattan with exotic bitters and cherry juice and do you think you re going to save me from scurvy or something I want bourbon bitters and sweet vermouth and go easy on everything but the bourbon This is no time for creativity The dessert menu is stupid Who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream Hire a dessert chef I would totally recommend Bacaro if you need fancy dinner out Sometimes I do Sometimes I have parents who need impressing 
7Bnv8IIFdlCXS1k96QfE-A CMU My first and hopefully last visit to Destihl was a faculty dinner Destihl is apparently one of the few places in town large enough to accommodate simultaneous departmental functions as there were multiple university based parties that night But this convenience is off set by the depressingly overblown chain aesthetic here manifesting as a too self conscious effort to seem on trend with both gastro pubs and microbreweries witness for instance the giant prop barrels by the front door while failing to capture the particular qualities of either The artisan food was as mediocre as expected from this self described gastrobrewpub TM We ordered pizzas as appetizers for the table stone oven seems to be a euphemism for toaster oven The crusts were uniformly thin but creepily so without bubbling or crispness the undersides were barely cooked I suspect pre formed frozen dough by the taste and all too regular texture The generous toppings were not supported by the crust making each slice limp and increasingly wet We also ordered the deep fried asparagus but I refrained the asparagus looked both too thick these stalks were almost hot dog sized in circumference and too greasy One of our dinner companions warned us against ordering burgers on her last visit her medium rare burger was burned black on one side and was not at all medium rare She guessed that the cooks went outside for a smoke and forgot to flip the burgers but generously wondered if it had just been a long night for them in the kitchen In an attempt to heed her advice I tried to order the grilled and stuffed pasta without olives but the waiter told me that the olives are already mixed in I took that to mean that the pasta is made in a giant vat ahead of time here I imagined a big plastic tub covered in Saran wrap in a walk in freezer and grilled to order which didn t sound all that appetizing Instead I ordered the veggie burger black beans and rice and my g f the Kobe burger medium rare Both arrived with one black charred side her burger was well done ruining the meat Why eat Kobe beef if it s just going to be burned to a crisp My veggie burger was unremarkable and my pile of shoestring fries had been overcooked in the fryer and served to me lukewarm to cold totally inedible I nibbled on two and then had to stop Cold grease ugh I d much rather order a burger and fries from Steak n Shake where you know what you re getting for the money Overall Destihl was a big no way I will strenuously avoid coming here again 
7V_kV9zNL7sp5mQs3lZapQ CMU Yum That hit the spot I wandered around campus for a good hour looking for a place to enjoy a nice meal and glass of wine but had no luck near the college so I came back to the hotel where I am staying I wanted a steak but thought the 8 oz filet was a little pricey and large so I settled on the 4 oz filet and subbed fries for a house salad for 2 My steak was perfectly cooked and was served with a side of broccolini and a dab of buttery sauce for only 10 The 8 oz fillet is only 25 and comes with sides and a salad so that s not a bad deal either I also had breakfast here this morning and was very satisfied with my scrambled eggs and bacon I would definitely recommend this place I know it s my first review but it s legit 
8cGIm7In8KywX_2POIlLRA CMU My review was filtered and I guess this one will be too This place has terrible some of the worst in a town filled with bad service I ve ever had And the food is not good Look at all the filtered reviews before eating here 
8GMiSgniyh_i58Sb25lGjA CMU This was short and sweet but I scouted this place out ahead of time for a visit from out of town The best compliment I can think to pay this place is that I wish we had gone here first We ate somewhere else which was good and tried to get beers at the Blind Pig with little success After going here and having a few 4 oz pours among three of us I REALLY wish we had skipped everything else and ate had beers here If the beer was any indication of the food we missed out Very good 
8mulE40TLvc6XV_mbgIa6Q CMU Here Price Quality Brunch on Sunday is the best I ve been to in the longest Only upset feeling from trying their desserts is for the people who DIDN T try the desserts 
8riBBhqsdLB34jlM4XcYbw CMU This is a great place to just chill whether it with friends or if you just failed an exam and you need a drank lol They have great drink deals and good food too I recommend trying the Irish nachos They have different specials everyday too 
9bSxlVs4VHWqIvK3uk9I0g CMU Go Mega it s worth it When the fries are done right they re some of the best in town and FREE with any sandwich every Sunday The one fella has been there forever I believe his name is Jim and he s an awful nice guy My only lament is the loss of truly beer battered chicken fingers sometime around the time they expanded Now they re just the frozen in a bag variety and not particularly notable 
9dvmADjZgqKCHlozyFdl0A CMU A M A Z I N G I m originally from NY and was visiting the area This place blew my mind it was so good We chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses complete with a cheese course and dessert I paired it with the wines too The wine list was definitely impressive Lots of interesting wines at very fair prices They are considered a wine bar so I was hoping for a good list But I was impressed with the prices there were many bottles on the list for under 30 which is always great to me It s easy to fill a list with great expensive bottles but it is indeed very difficult to pick a variety of great wines at reasonable prices The wines paired perfectly with each dish I was so happy About the food I was just so impressed The octopus over german potato salad was unlike anything I ve ever had and just so delicious Yes it does sound strange but it was so well done and the octopus was cooked just perfectly it was so tender I was so thrilled the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses We had a big scallop seared and served over corn salsa which was almost sweet but just delicious We also had braised rabbit which again was tender and also quite flavorful sitting in a pool of broth with some tomatoes and homemade pasta The rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender The cheese course was fun And I loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert To be honest I was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes Sure it is a more expensive dinner out but for the quality and caliber of the dishes it is a steal This is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences Easily 5 stars for Bacaro 
9gOBcI9KTlleYCY3pqG01A CMU They call this an Irish pub but there s nothing Irish about it in my opinion Honestly people don t care about the atmosphere do they They just come for the booze They serve the typical junk food and it is very crowded during the weekends They have a few specials too so do check those out 
9NcOriJ81ZCyIsVc0hxJsQ CMU I wish I could give Bacaro five stars To be fair there s a lot to like about it The quality of the ingredients is high The ambience is great too The servers are among the most professional in the C U area The food is genuinely sophisticated However Bacaro s commitment to local seasonal ingredients while being one of its strengths is also one of its greatest weaknesses The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing Of three visits I ve eaten some bad ok and great meals Visit 1 Had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint gazpacho The fish was fresh and of excellent quality This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty What could have been a complex herbaceous broth wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep Visit 2 Valentine s Day prix fixe Three courses all of which were delicious The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon Delicious and fresh My main was halibut again with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet good flavors that were well executed Visit 3 Pork loin with mustard spaetzle The spaetzle were delicious I could eat that spaetzle every day The pork however was DRY Really really dry I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork It was that dry So in closing out of three expensive visits the food has been good maybe 1 5 times with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal valentine s day and the side of one of my mains the spaetzle If the food was consistent Bacaro would be an easy 5 stars Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently executed menu 
9O8VPK6s-tfN5xEmKXGpEQ CMU This is my favorite bar on campus It is a solid pub where they serve cheap and delicious beer The food is decent but not that great That said the specials on Tuesday and Wednesday offer a pretty good value 5 for 1 2 lb burger fries What could really improve this place is better music The jukebox is too susceptible to people with bad music tastes Also the tables can be kind of sticky but thats par with the course 
9R-MFF5T6BnhbqDWBlUxZw CMU I worked here about three hundred years ago and I thought it was the greatest bar ever at the time However it is not However it is still better than just about every other bar on campus circa 2002 The burgers are phenemonal as is the BBQ chicken 
9TbOI-9d1GvibtEaGM0AiA CMU It had been a couple years since I last went to The Bread Company and since today was a beautiful day to sit outside and eat a sandwich my boyfriend and I decided to give it a go I got a half portobello sandwich half strawberry salad a delightful combination and everything tasted fresh I m gonna have to figure out how to make that sandwich on my own My boyfriend s salmon burger was pretty good but served on bread and not a bun which was kind of odd I also had the English Orange iced tea which was refreshing and a little sweet without being cloying Our waitress had a major stick up her ass though which is why I m downgrading them a star Bread Co why must you hire rude people More often than not the people working here are gruff and disdainful of the customers I get it you re too cool to smile I m not asking for a hug at the end of the meal all I m looking for is service without a scowl 
9vc2wKha-f4u_DiF_ZtqyQ CMU Waiter has no voice left and is still the nicest waiter ever Derek Nice atmosphere Pricey for sure 
9vpwSrzRUicKQGXcgo48Kw CMU When I was in college I never suggested Murphy s but always ended up there because friends worked there Decent food semi cheap good strong drinks if you know the bartenders and decent specials After 12 there are definitely lines Thursday Saturday nights it s usually one in one out If you get a booth it s a good place to chill out play card games indulge in some greasy ness and hang with friends The music is pretty loud for a laid back bar so you will leave with a hoarse voice but oh well An added bonus is they have photo hunt 
9X12P8EItruNiyhLuRm64Q CMU I ve eaten here twice for dinner over the last five years and was very pleased on both occasions We had pizzas both times They are wonderful They very much resemble the style we ve had in Rome very thin crisp crust light on the creative toppings The portobello artichoke roasted peppers and fontina one was especially memorable Service was very good prompt friendly and quick Our waitresses were very pleasant The prices may seem a little high so if you want a cheap thick crust gloppy stuffed pizza go elsewhere 
9Yf5EIq5Ofh90NUsBCfhJg CMU I went here with some friends last Wednesday night and I really liked it My friend and I split the stuffed chicken breast with loaded mashed potatoes and a wedge salad The wedge salad was really good although it s tough to mess up a salad The loaded mashed potatoes were fantastic The stuffed chicken breast could have been a little better I was not pleased with the overwhelming burnt flavor of the onions and I think the grill could have been cleaned a little better because there was a lot of it on the chicken breast The chicken was not dried out at all and it really was not that bad I will order it again to see if there is any improvement We had the layered chocolate cake for desert and that was a very good choice Very moist and flavorful It was really good It s still a loud environment perhaps leftover from Fridays I wish we didn t have to yell to have a conversation That being said I think this will be a great place to have drinks in better weather conditions Looks like a great patio with flat screen TVs and heaters 
A20Y7CFjk-dvw7rHcZcQuA CMU Checked out Silvercreek for lunch it was very tasty My boyfriend and I tried a couple sandwiches the BLT topped with goat cheese and guac and the cuban Both were delicious and moderately priced only about 7 7 50 each cheaper than some of the other cafes in downtown urbana or champaign Service was great the restaurant was not too busy would definitely go back again for lunch 
AbyWvDc7gi5krR5dO57Huw CMU A solid two stars yes First of all I ll say the taste of the food is pretty good The quality of the food and drink was above average The popcorn presented when we arrived was nicely flavored with spices but came in a rather small tin We began with two cocktails which were delicious but for the area were either too small or overpriced Thus began the battle of the perceptions in regards to overpriced versus tiny portions We did not have appetizers because in my mind they were a little pricey Deviled eggs for 1 00 each Ok I get it these are local eggs But half of an egg with a little mayo and some flavoring mixed into the yolk for 1 00 Nope still expensive Fries for 4 00 Nope not for this guy Besides Illinois isn t know for their potato harvests 9 00 for a mixed greens salad How about make that salad plural and give us a couple of them for that price Moving on I wanted to try the famous Tavern Burger However at 7 45 p m in a restaurant which wasn t packed out they were out for the evening Really Hmmm how strange You mean the cheapest choice for dinner the one item which was mentioned in the newspaper and was considered your house specialty and worth mentioning again your CHEAPEST dinner choice was out so early How very strange I guess that meant I would have to choose a more expensive option And incidentally our server told us you made it fresh every day So why didn t you just whip up a little more of the mix Or does the bison truck come very morning We chose the Trout and the Pork Loin First the portion sizes were tiny For the price of the trout we expected at least half of a small trout for 18 00 What we got was about 1 3 to 1 2 of a side of a small trout As for the pork we received what amounted to about a 3 oz portion Now I understand it s local But and I m saying this as a consumer and a cook pork is not expensive There is no grocery store in Champaign where you can go and find any cut of pork out pricing Beef And the accompaniments the turnips chicory and cornbread were nice tasty and well presented were cool and not substantial The pork for the price should have been at least twice the size and even this would have made the price extravagant We shared a bottle of white wine from the menu the wine selection being very good by the way and also had dessert I had the Ice Cream Sandwich which should have been slightly warmed so as to not have been served rock hard and my guest had the Pot de Cr me Both were delicious Overall I believe our bill totaled more than 140 00 Can you believe it 140 00 for two cocktails one bottle of white wine which retailed for about 13 00 two main dishes and two desserts Fine for Haute Cuisine not fine for a tavern We found the service to be just about perfect as our server was attentive and respectful of both our needs and our privacy The atmosphere is great in this place The food is good but not great With the expanding options in the area especially the great options across the street there is little to nothing to draw me back to this establishment 
Ac-1qH6GkckfIwYsowvTwQ CMU A nice addition to Downtown Champaign 
ajP2c11UKQsRBy8gV2qy8g CMU Murphy s is a great bar to go to if you just want to chill I ve been to a couple fun happy hours here but how can a happy hour not be fun and I ve had some of their deliciously fried greasey appetizers too There are plenty of booths and tables to sit and play some cards drinking may or may not accompany said card games Overall it wouldn t be my first choice bar on the weekends but maybe on a weekday The crowd is less Greek which doesn t really matter to me but it s nice to point out 
aKT2rcIgcmrPvMLSFzERBg CMU My boyfriend took me to Bacaro for an amazingly romantic dinner date I was impressed with the atmosphere the knowledgable waitstaff and flavorful I would definitely return 
akupp9AvmH2eeMM3IhtVLw CMU Bevier Cafe has some great deals for good quality food I love their food the lasagna is great But the dessert is just okay I m a sweet freak but even I have to say that the dessert is too sweet but not enough flavor Other than that the food is delicious and nice for a quick bite 
amz0iyupcRbldS11Y1NhaA CMU I ate there for lunch first time diner Our waitress was very nice and guided us through the process I tried chicken the first time through and it was good But the second trip I opted for noodles and shrimp which was delicious The bread was tasty although I m sure unhealthy I would suggest making small bowls and going back multiple times to try different things 
aObE7KceQ3qB3i-phyJ5Hw CMU Well balanced coffee not inexpensive but good value for money for the coffee It s a truck so you are not getting a coffeehouse You are getting a good cup of coffee Love the place Was thrilled to see they had Cheese Crackers sandwiches 
AOFSRsOYMIgo3UGVobTd3Q CMU A couple of friends and I decided to take a spur of the moment trip to Urbana to meet our parent campus and get to know the university It was a sunday and we wanted to catch the NFL games so naturally we went up to a bar Murphy s was our 3rd choice after the other 2 bars were either closed or not showing any games The place was empty not surprising coming from a college town where all they care about is Saturday Football except for a couple of old guys talking to themselves They had a lot of TVs and only one game on when we asked them to switch it they couldn t because they didn t own the football package strike one Despite the place being deserted our server never took our order and we had to go up to the bar to have them take it There is some controversy about this as some bars will have you do that in the early evening but I ve been to bars in the middle of nowhere at the same time where this wasn t the case Either way that was a bit annoying so strike two Strike three came along when after ordering we had to pick up our own food at the kitchen At that point we gave up on good expectations and simply sat down to watch the game The good news is their food is amazing My friend and I are no fans of fries either but man they were awesome And their bean burger was gigantic and extremely good according to my friend while I had the steak sandwich and that was absolutely perfect In any case chances are the place is legit on Saturday Game Day but it s up to you if you want to try it out 
AP3DowRFyn-4x6f5IOlDFA CMU Two ratings from the perspective of a grad student Week nights Three stars Good prices and decent for a campus bar food Weekends One star Full of undergrads stay away I only come here for office happy hours during the week since it is close 
ARQcNSUvXUS84fz4xysUNg CMU Its pretty cool to get ice cream at a drive thru but you had better be ready with your order when you pull up or they treat you like an asshole Yes I know how it works but when there are 60 ways to get any of their 30 items sometimes I need a little time to sort out exactly what I want to give you money to serve me 
ATo-nfLBc-2AgufD1QoXLQ CMU I ate here for my Graduation dinner The service was pretty good and the food was decent They have a pretty extensive menu and the atmosphere is great The outside and surrrounding property at this place is awesome I got some great pictures here with my family 
AtQmuyPN3NMypIrq7aftBQ CMU I only gave it five stars because I can only give five stars I was in town for 24 hours it probably will not return to Champaign again I wish I could take this restaurant with me on the road It was a pleasure to have this restaurant available in the middle of Illinois The scallops and pork were delicious The grilled octopus salad is a must Portions are not huge but adequate In my party one person have the ribeye It was fantastic The other person had the grilled salmon and it was equally good All in all this restaurant must not be missed 
AtwIjbLkhYUFwfnPiUcKhQ CMU I had the fish tacos hubby had a bacon cheeseburger and the kids had corn dogs The fish tacos were very tasty 
aUpaVVYwYEp-XpAOWLqW0g CMU I really was not expecting to give a brewpub 5 stars but here goes We went on a Monday night and the restaurant was FULL which was A good to see for a new business and B surprising The decor is surprisingly upscale really cool use of natural stone and wood HUGE shame they didn t open with their patio ready to go but when I inquired they said it was in the plans to open the patio soon The beers I tried 5 yup 5 were decent not world class but decent My favorite purely for summer drinkability was the Champaign Blonde but I am admittedly not into dark beers at all and there are PLENTY of dark ones and heavier Begian style ales which I didn t try The menu looked surprisingly interesting I was expecting burgers and pretzels and between us we tried the pickled cucumber salad the tuna carpaccio the strawberry salad and the warm salmon and potato salad All four dishes were winners although the small plates ARE really small which is exactly what we wanted The entrees are MASSIVE for the price and look like they are high quality meals but I m glad we saw how big they were before we ordered one Service was excellent from beginning to end The desserts also looks amazing but I was too full to try As a gay couple it was nice to feel comfortable and that there was a real mix of clientele I was scared it was going to be exclusively Olive Garden goers but there were some hipsters some queens and some students as well as your typical casual dining crowd Can t wait for the patio to open but believe me there will be a serious wait time on those tables be prepared 
AvhtZdIFeKhJeA4CjAJ5PA CMU I don t understand why the lunch and dinner here are so different Is there a different owner for each meal Lunch is self service no frills sandwiches and soups In a word plain Dinner is table service and can be good But they emphasize a gimmicky fondue service and the main dishes can be hit and miss The pizzas are solid Meat can be over or undercooked Order seafood watch out Why is it called the Bread Company They do appear to make their own bread but it isn t that good Seems misleading Kind of like their specials list It doesn t change 
ayUMcqATmISr1ZoRFMI7hQ CMU This is really a 4 5 star rating Came for lunch and loved it The restaurant is beautiful the service is fun helpful knowledgeable and attentive There is also a great outdoor seating area The food was really great especially the BLT There is an interesting and fairly extensive selection of beers My only complaint is that it is a limited lunch menu 
b13WG8fZR8zSFJw4GET7-w CMU atmosphere is nice but hard to enjoy when too busy because the tables are close Appetizers are average and though cleaner and slightly better aray of options than flat top the price is too steep for dinner can spend 40 00 for two at a local restaurant and have much better quality Go for lunch to save 
B2k7-EpZygWfK2mlix-omw CMU I ve been here a few times I like it for lunch Their beer is alright The flatbread y pizza with lemon and arugula was delicious I have it on good authority that their portobello sandwich is better than The Bread Company I think the dinner both the crowds and the food are a little pretentious My BF thinks that this is a great place for women who shop at Chicos to meet up with each other and discuss the braided leather belts they bought for their husbands Which is to say he thinks they overdo atmosphere to keep the rif raff out In my experience I will sacrifice dim lighting for a chile that is actually spicy Oh midwestern restaurants Are you using bell peppers to make Chile Rellenos My littlest brother really liked it though He devoured some friend bacon appetizer 
B3KGy_sgjEekEUcUfxSXOg CMU Hmmm what to say what to say I came here for dinner the other Sunday night place was quiet but very nice in terms ambiance The menu was very nice The service was excellent The food would have been good even excellent except the chef was very heavy with the salt every dish was salty excessively so Not enough to send it back but one more grain of salt and I would have refused to eat it My companion suffered the same fate The wine list was either very expensive they did not have it or Slovenian not sure what s up with that We ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked I d give the place one more try just to see if perhaps this was an off night To the other raves comparing this place to the top restaurants in NY or Chicago I would say oh please It was good showed promise of things possibly greater but comparing it to a dozen places I could name off the top of my head in either city Bacaro was good but at these prices it should have been better 
B4ApL9fBpgzah1TSH8V-tg CMU Went for dinner and sat on the patio which was wonderful because there was a band playing on the corner Our food was very good but the best part was the coffee and dessert Our waiter recommended the sour cherry bread pudding and it was awesome Our waiter was great too Despite them being extremely busy he was very attentive and very helpful 
bBB0XTNkIc1SB4qmoctE-g CMU I ll confess that after nine years I never took the time to sit down in Bacaro for a meal before last night I always preferred Radio Maria Escobar or some other place for a nice meal So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro I decided to Yelp it and I was and still am very suspicious of a few of the reviews Here was a place with lots of 1 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant I may be a cynic but it raises red flags So we set off to do our own independent research Three people on a Friday night The place is full we get one of a couple of available tables with no reservations The waitress was wonderful My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service and she was great She knew the menu she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked She kept her distance and watched us for cues never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait The wine list is huge the drink list is equally huge but both are very pricey by Champaign standards My wife s martini was a very full glass all the way up to the c section as we Assembly Hall fans would say We had a risotto special with fish for the table one mixed green salad and one fried pork belly starter The pork belly was 10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate humorous by its dinkyness But good like a chunk of fried bacon fat Then we had three entrees all were very good Mine was the grouper 28 and frankly I don t recall my companion s meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D Rhone between the three of us The Cote D Rhone was 28 bottle and the lowest price wine on the list Several other wines could be had in the high 30 s and then the rest of the list was north of 40 One apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for 192 before tip and she was worth the 40 tip we left so by the end of the day it approached 77 per person So if you start a Yelp review at a three this place gets one more star for having a great server one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside out including cloth hand towels in the loo Then I ll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market but if Yelp allowed half stars I d give Bacaro 4 5 
BCE-ZcCb709Ppujenj1GIg CMU Honestly I m a little surprised that Destihl s Yelp rating isn t higher Two of my friends and I wandered in on a weekday night while looking for a place to eat at in downtown Champaign The restaurant was relatively full for 7pm on Thursday so I d imagine there may be a wait on weekend nights Beers good I think we tried 4 The strawberry blonde ale on tap was a clear favorite for us Both their beer and dinner menus took awhile for us to look at I was expecting traditional pub style food but their offerings far exceeded that We started off with the deviled egg appetizer and the beer battered bacon appetizer Both were very good the beer battered bacon is a MUST Jalapeno bacon in a tempura like beer batter coating topped with a drizzle of maple chipotle glaze Yes please When it came to our table we slowly stopped talking and watched our plate of bacon descend in front of us Like it came down straight from heaven We didn t even realize we stopped talking and didn t remember what we were talking about until the bacon was gone My friends got the jambalaya and the prosciutto wrapped meatloaf I really only tried part of the super tasty andouille sausage corn muffin that came with the jambalaya as I was working on my full slab of beer braised ribs I gave one rib each to my friends to try though They were perfect Orders of magnitude better than Black Dog s ribs I m not sure whether or not that s a fair comparison since it s different cooking styles but the texture of Destihl s ribs was absolutely perfect tender falling off the bone but not annoyingly so The flavor was great also as it tasted lovely by itself and did not need to be hidden behind sauce although the chipotle espresso bbq sauce it came with was also very tasty My friends and I agreed that I won dinner since I ordered the best dish My only qualm was that my shoestring fries were a little soggy and not as crispy as I would have preferred But that s very minor We were all pretty full but could not pass up dessert Like the rest of their menus the dessert menu had a lot of tasty sounding options After some rock paper scissors we ended up ordering the stout ice cream sandwiches which is more like four round brownie patties a la mode But by all means if you really wanted to I guess you could try to eat it ice cream sandwich style The alcohol in the chocolate stout ice cream wasn t very strong Both the ice cream and the brownies were stellar My friends especially loved the brownies I was wondering what they did with the remaining brownie part after cutting out the rounds to you know save waste if need be and our waitress told us that the remainder is used for their chocolate martini Maybe I ll check that out next time Oh and also our waitress was very nice and friendly too Overall good service clean place nice decor everything was great After tips came out to 30 person but actually filling up me two guys does require a bit of food and drink I m already trying to think of when I will return to try the kobe burger 
BDRUP8r_3cQqrjw2QzVH2Q CMU I ma having a continued ridiculous love affair with Bevier Cafe You see I have a class from 11 12 in Bevier Hall and the cafe itself is exactly one floor below my classroom Did I mention I get out at noon When lunch is served Yeah you do the math It s a damn good thing that B C is relatively cheap 4 50 for a major entree or sandwich or I d be broke and panhandling in front of the place at this rate The Food Service students run a fantastic local cafe that helps them get hands on experience and gets me lunch time eatin on the cheap There s always a vegetable side some mouthwatering dessert and the space is cheery and pleasant if a bit utilitarian Bevier s well worth the visit That said it s basically cafeteria style in that you pick up a tray select your food options add on bread dessert drinks etc then pay for your meal They ll give you a number and a smiling food service student will bring you your food often eerily promptly Now my only request is that you don t crowd up the place when i come charging in all hungry like Cuz that s not cool But go check out the cafe with a fantastic array of food orders and a daily changing menu you re bound to be satisfied 
bgrKVVmhnXw5iL3b1r5kIw CMU I have yet to have a bad meal at Big Grove after six visits I visit Champaign frequently on business and I was continually disappointed with local food which tends to be chains or local places serving poor quality low cost processed food right off the truck which seems very ironic for a sophisticated college town surrounded by great farm land Now however that s changed thanks to Big Grove Tavern and the arrival of a real chef Big Grove is every bit as good as a great gastro pub in California Chicago or New York The roasted chicken is delicious the deviled eggs are amazing and the fish is sublime The deserts are stunning This food is creative and delicious It s a fun lively place with a casual atmosphere probably the coolest interior in town by far It s so strange that a few people who have reviewed this place on Yelp think that the fresh local and delicious food at Big Grove is expensive or not worth it It s amazingly well priced for the quality you get It s just plain good here all the way around and that s probably a shock to their system The portions and flavors are perfect and well balanced The waiters actually care and know the menu Warning If you are used to low end corporate food straight out of a box microwaved by a careless cook and sold at a bargain basement prices in big heaping mounds like most places in Champaign Urbana then this place is definitely not for you And if you love corporate chains and hate supporting your local economy and farms or you don t like the idea of the fresh and delicious food revolution finally reaching Champaign Urbana then please stay away Big Grove is a culinary breakthrough for CU and I hope it brings more foodie talent to the area I wish it continued success for years to come Who can argue with local fresh delicious and well priced food 
BKvJPOEMP5DkNsYPDS8Zlw CMU My favorite C U bar Nice place on campus but without a heavy Illini feel I first started going because I was underage and they didn t card way back when but kept going after I was legal because it s a good spot to eat and talk They cook excellent burgers and fries and the teriyaki chicken sandwich is divine Many beers on tap and knowledgable bartenders 
BmWhL35Wi_-ncl-OIH7dRg CMU I was very impressed with the quality of service and the food at Silvercreek Headed there for the first time for a friend s birthday with a large group of people Since I try to eat vegan and I know it can be a pain to sort that out in a large party I called ahead to ask if there were any vegan items on the menu The hostess was incredibly helpful pointing me toward a couple of salads and a vegetarian entree that could easily be made vegan and reassuring me that if nothing on the menu caught my eye the chef would be more than happy to create something for me with the veggies and pasta they have available Service at the restaurant was equally good I went with the autumn salad Garden greens apricots pears grapes pecans hazelnut vinaigrette which was refreshing and delicious and the stuffed poblano peppers Black bean corn rice stuffing red onion cilantro chihuahua cheese paquillo pepper sauce without the cheese The peppers were TO DIE for The pepper sauce was insane creamy and delicious yet somehow dairy free I still wish I had gotten that recipe I d definitely recommend Silvercreek for any vegans or non vegans looking to get a high quality meal 
bPYIUg9jbkJ_lhf9X9R8ag CMU i love this place toooooooo they are sterile and yummy reminds me of a daily changing ikea cafeteria and i love ikea i love coming here for lunch and since i m at IGB these days i don t even have to leave my building it s awesome their menu changes but it s always decently priced for alot of food Great soups for a buck with any entree That s awesome enough for me 
br8DOzeeZnryVe-3PSy6SQ CMU For the price that this Central Illinois establishment charges one would expect basic restaurant treatment I waited for 15 minutes even though I had a reservation The host was a snooty inconsiderate person to which I told him relax this is Central Illinois there s nothing to be snooty about And most importantly the food was over priced did not taste good and the portions were small All in all not the greatest 
bwqGECWfUqIVxYy9Fq53bA CMU UPS reasonable price for a potentially HUGE portion awesome location busy and fun with friendly waitstaff and cooks cheap drinks for downtown GREAT quality ingredients and they use local farmers when possible which I love love love Oh and you get to watch the food being cooked DOWNS Red lights make my eyes bug out and um yup that s about it Other things Don t order an appetizer unless you can eat a LOT of food The wonton appetizer is flavorless I squeezed lime and added salt and pepper to the dip and it was much tastier 
c2INwkesnOXzyOHzZz4UJw CMU Meh for a college town this is doable for drinks and bar food Nothing special but I m wondering what the differences are in color for the bar tabs 
C5tGZ8Zi74P-mWqw2FVCzQ CMU The positive The Aztec chocolate martini comes with a brownie garnish And it s spicy The waiters and bartenders I ve talked to have been incredibly friendly The food s better than you d expect actually The salad was good which is maybe not what you d expect from a place that labels itself a brew pub The pizza s a little boring but that s probably just the vegetarian ones I m limited to They serve continuously they have a large cocktail list they take my American Express it s everything a burgeoning yuppie alcoholic could want in a brew pub Except that s not really me so here s what I don t like The atmosphere As I read through the descriptions they say oh the atmosphere is great and I say are you at the same restaurant It s what a corporate design team thinks of as good atmosphere Large airy and completely devoid of personality It matches Jim Gould s across the street very well actually The whole place really just reeks of chain and I don t think that bothers most people at all but if I want to go in by myself and have a late lunch I feel very awkward I m happy to go in with friends and have cocktails and split a pound of cake They actually inform me that it is an 11 pound cake split 10 ways so slightly more than a pound Worth checking out if for no other reason than you too have probably been watching them work on this place for a couple years You can t NOT go 
c6kfnxkg5XRAkqh61NyQiw CMU We ve been to Destihl maybe six times now for brunch lunch and dinner Most of the food is very good better conceived and made than a lot of other area restaurants offer Portions are fairly generous not so much with brunch items and the price fits the quality of ingredients and preparation The staffing is good service is timely and the decor is charming The craft beers made on site are wonderful Try a series of 4 ouncers to build your own tasting The flavor profiles given on the brew menu seem so far to have been accurate For appetizers I recommend the shrimp ceviche technically a small plate and the stone oven pretzels you get two with cheese and spicy honey mustard dips I ve tried one soup the corn and chicken chowder which was very good nice SW pepper flavor without overwhelming the chicken We ve had sandwiches and entrees from burgers to steak and it s all been really delicious The food is in the American Contemporary Casual style better than Houlihan s at the i Hotel in our opinion The only bad experience we ve had with the food has been the cedar plank brie dessert It was badly prepared the brie wasn t even room temperature and either the recipe was off or the honey chili sauce was made incorrectly because it was completely unbalanced and unpalatable The smoke flavor reacted poorly with what was on the plank too We took the brie home a big piece and cut off the rind to eat the middle later but it still tasted of rank sauce and smoke We did not go back to the restaurant for a couple of months because of just how bad this was I wrote the general manager and he was good about it offering to review the recipe and preparation with the lead chef Since returning to Destihl we ve had good experiences again the place is consistent a fun place to socialize and a nice addition to CU s restaurant scene 
c8paqofYQlK0jTOY2IzW6w CMU All right so I ve now been to both locations of Destihl and I have to say they re both pretty good not stellar but a slightly above average brewpub I tried their Hawaii five ale which was okay it was a fruit beer that was supposed to remind me of being on a beach in Hawaii Well anything is possible it was a tarter beer but still a very light ale They didn t have their dunkelweizen here which was disappointing I got hungry waiting for my friend so I ordered the Ancho chips and dip The chips were just okay but the vinegar and the dressings were really quite good The habanero vinegar wasn t overpoweringly hot but had a nice kick and the ranch was more than just a ranch dressing I had the bison burger because I haven t had bison meat in a while and it was just as good The burger though was all right the bison slightly sweeter and less greasy than ground beef was good The dressing on it though took away from the flavor of the meat but the fries were actually quite tasty Overall it s still an okay place 
CA1b3Y3INzIHszW8miEgWg CMU The beverages are good The food is average Everything tastes a bit bland 
CaKjJDcuIcvdgknG_iIzVw CMU I think it s a pretty good brunch I would give it four stars if it wasn t as pricey 18 for a brunch buffet is pretty steep especially since they don t continually serve food in fresh portions By the time we got there the meats and pastas were on the dry side The desserts are yummy omelet was very good and the variety you can t beat I would go earlier and not as often 
cFcmCPdlKc-p3KP4AlRuvQ CMU Higher end restaurant You should probably dress up Pre nights are held here I d only recommend going here only for happy hour appetizer specials and drinks Off campus in Urbana 
cgkOmpfgEbcqyp8RrIuEzw CMU Went here for an anniversary a while back with the idea that it was one of the nicer places in town I did have high expectations and was a bit disappointed I do like the rustic ambiance but the menu has little to no imagination and the wine list is quite small I would suggest the lobster Mac n cheese though 
cJweJTUatGamlVxfEgB8Iw CMU Pretty good food Pretty good price Sandwiches are a little small but the sides are cheap The service is really fast My girlfriend says the portions are good for girls but not for guys 
cMxGiOnePFQRnY5cxhlq_g CMU My only complaint was the waitress was a complete moron I am very forgiving of servers too being a former one myself She had no idea what was good on the menu and just kept saying Im a vegetarian With that being said in Champaign I haven t had a better meal I had the veal and it was wonderful I can t recall much else but in a town without much choices other than the usual college fare this ranks up there 
Cr1OGI68dM91ALevdjHE3A CMU The food is excellent and the bread is the best in Urbana Dinner is delightful with excellent gourmet pizzas fondu tapas etc On Sunday they have an excellent and low priced brunch The dinner prices are reasonable for the quality of the food Their sangria is also the best I ve ever tasted The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the service which at times is very slow 
D-cpIMX-LHHCfrp1oR3fwQ CMU Went here for din din with my broey and his wifepoo since they live in the area Food was fantastic Service was spot on our waitress was very attentive and took great care of us We had a flight of the many beers they offer the menu is extensive and it s hard to decide But one thing is 1000 worth getting Beer Battered Asparagus That s it Who cares if you have stinky pee from eating asparagus totally worth it 
d4yReMMcdMyvfwK-ThipGA CMU This is a review of the Sunday brunch which is AWWWWESOME I usually try to get a group to go to brunch every couple of months and we always come here There is so much on the buffet ranging from a waffle station omelette station salads veggies pasta salmon shrimp potatoes a carving station and an absolutely wonderful array of desserts to choose from I walk out of here feeling stuffed for days While the cost is not cheap I think it s around 19 including a beverage it is well well worth it I have tried the other top Sunday brunch place in Urbana and Silvercreek blows them away 
d6jookVxskbGIron0mDQ1Q CMU We really wanted to like this place We are local we eat and shop local we want to support local business So we had a bad meal the Ruben was terrible I did not know corned beef could be so bad and the bread was worse Anyway I thought to myself that even in my own place we make mistakes and once in a while the best customer ends up with a poor meal So we told our waitress why we did not like the food we had eaten maybe a 1 4 of the food served if not an 1 8th Anyway she said Ok and left That was it It was Ok with her we were served a poor meal Food is not good Servers are not well trained or managed Decor was nice for a quick service restaurant Highly over priced for the quality of the food served With so many other wonderful local choices Black Dog s BBQ Crane Ally Timpone s Pizza Rick s Bakery Cheese Crackers Sandwiches and Chocolates I have no reason to ever return 
DG8_DN8UExCtcpAKCZYqHg CMU My husband and I went here for the first time for our 25th wedding anniversary dinner We decided to go to Bacaro on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend thinking it would be nice to avoid the crowds on a Friday or Saturday night It is a beautiful modern looking restaurant When you walk in there are two rooms the first room behind the hostess stand has more room and tables are further apart The second room to the right behind the hostess stand has the long bar in it and tables are very close together down the left side of the room one long banquette sofa on one side of the tables The 3 or 4 tables in front of the window in this room were all taken already We had high hopes for the restaurant given the reviews we d read heard and that it has been open for quite a long time would seem to be a tried and true restaurant My hobby since high school 20 years ago has been finding going to good restaurants at home and travelling But first strike happened right off the bat with the hostess Apparently they were not seating in the first room she showed us two tables one not cleaned off in the middle of the seating on the left and the other in the very back corner next to an already occupied table Since it was a special night we really didn t want to be shoved in a corner so we asked for the middle table Wonder why she wouldn t have cleaned off the table first and then asked us which one we would like The tables are uncomfortably close together a group of 3 was to our right No one was at the two tables next to us Second strike instead of trying to give people space that was available the hostess set a couple right next to us instead of a table over We found out later that the next room did end up being used and we could have had a table with much more room privacy It was awkward all evening being that close to two other tables Third strike it was apparent very quickly that the restaurant had only two waiters handling the whole restaurant I don t know if someone didn t show up or if it was poor planning Maybe they thought it would be a quiet night and that two would do it We could tell our waitress was harried from the moment she arrived at our table and as I watched her throughout the evening she never stopping running from the kitchen throughout the room I m sure she was one tired girl by the end of the evening Fourth strike we don t drink and ordered ice teas No sugar offered and she was so busy we hated to even bother her Finally at some point we managed to sneak in the ask But why did we have to ask Fifth strike three of the items I was interesting in choosing from for my entree had mint in them I am not a big fan of mint so when the waitress came to take our order I needed to know if I could have the kitchen hold the mint on whatever I ordered She said she could check but then waited to take our order which I really couldn t give until I knew the answer Awkward moment So after hem hawing a moment she finally headed to the kitchen to ask I felt bad because I knew she was harried and didn t need this and I didn t want to make the chef s mad i e soup nazi but at the same time if I m going to pay close to 100 for a dinner for two surely I can ask Later the lady at the table next to me also had a special request for the kitchen which made me feel better Fortunately they were able to accept my request The dinner started off with an amuse bouche of a tiny square of frittata It was cute one of those fun things you get at nice restaurants but just okay I wished I had ordered the heirloom tomatoes as a starter but got flustered because of the above we both ended up ordering a salad w goat s cheese and peaches The peaches were heavenly deliciously ripe sweet and juicy my husband ate every last bite of his salad but mine had too many stemmed pieces of lettuce so I didn t do as well Sixth strike I had ordered the shrimp risotto and my husband had ordered chicken I noticed on the menu that it was 28 and thought hmm Mine was fine not blow me away good which was too bad because risotto I had recently at Silvercreek was WAY better but husband s chicken well you know that credit card commercial on tv where the couple goes out for a nice dinner and they get so little food they go out for sandwiches afterward That s the kind of dinner my husband had at Bacaro It arrived on a large white plate with nothing on it but a sliced chicken breast a chicken leg and essentially a chopped garnish of picked corn bacon etc And NOTHING else He was stil hungry after he ate it He was already asking what would be for breakfast that night when we went to bed because he was still hungry I read someone else s review on Yelp that also said 28 for chicken yelp says I m out of space will have to finish in another post 
DIf4va7ztN-OcbspNg12WQ CMU With its scarred wood tables friendly staff blaring sports games and dim lighting Murphy s is a local institution It s also where history graduate students tend to congregate once a week huzzah The beer food specials are generally fantastic and the grimy feel of the bar is palatable after a drink or two One caveat they have the nastiest nastiest bathroom It s hideous Ugh 
DMbiHEJaRjCUIehlp8UgJQ CMU Best burger and fries in town hands down 
dMDJbeoZCkk0110nkk-fDA CMU Utterly fantastic food The chef is a genious on par with any of the best restaurants in town but at a lower price than some of the more expensive competition Not as nice of an atmosphere as some of the fine dining restaruants like Jim Gould s and Silvercreek but every bit as tasty Destihl is going to have a great impact on downtown Also while I m not a beer person the people I ate with said the beer is an excellent local micro brew Perhaps not amazing but just as much as any reasonable person could hope for Also they do have a meeting conference room with a large table and an LCD TV 
DnLcswwXbWA5-Z-G_gfItg CMU Bacaro is very hit or miss there have been times I have loved my food and other times where the food has been average but has been expensive Overall it is a consistently good restaurant in terms of service However there are certain dishes that are more tasty than others I would definitely recommend trying Bacaro at least twice in an attempt to determine the types of dishes you like and don t like 
dPutz6TGhw71PbaD-gXfcA CMU Great place It came to one point where the waiter started recognizing me and my boyfriend and didn t give us menus It is kind of like a Flattop but much better The salmon is so tender and juicy it s amazing In addition their prices are pretty great On Sundays it is all day lunch price which is a great deal for multiple trips to the food bar 
drp4-x5g1jVCcisHBDNa_Q CMU This is another Mongolian Grill located near downtown that has a lot of good things going for it The things that were great were the selection of fresh vegetables and protein including salmon and shrimp The things I didn t care for were that I thought it was pricey but maybe I have grown accustomed to the student discount at Flattop Grill I went about 5 PM on a Friday night and it didn t start getting crowded until we left Service was very good but almost to attentive as we were at the counter creating our bowls I also thought it was interesting that none of the employees had recommendations on selections of sauces Also the person I went with asked for some simply soy sauce once we had creating our bowls and they had none It wasn t a major downfall as I found a sauce that was tasty Outside the stir fry you can also turn your stir fry into a soup or salad which I didn t do The bread that comes with was just OK in my opinion 
dSCbHWjQvcaOWb_E0KjTWA CMU I checked out these reviews before I went to Murphy s and was getting excited for the best burgers on campus HA It was tiny and my fries were more like hard sticks of oil While the atmosphere was cute the food left much to be desired 
e-aTsgDOfEBJDP-WU43JhQ CMU I have come here countless times over a 20 year span from when it was a little campus bar to its current ever expanding state Can t beat Wednesday night Bacon Mega Cheeseburger special night Usually good fries and the standard drinks A campus tradition with all kinds of stuff carved into the booths You can t graduate from UI without having gone there at least once preferably more 
E-k0z0lQu-H3LHTnj6Rpaw CMU The food at TBC is fine if you like moderately soggy vegetables and bland sandwiches They have vegetarian options that are okay more diverse than many places but the few times I ve been there the salads needed a little work It is a ok to tear the lettuce up a bit so people don t have to slobber it all over their faces I really hate a clunky salad The pear panini was satisfying and but the IKEA tables outside make me nostalgic for my own yard and my own cooking thus reinforcing my tagline Vegetarian with a touch of snobbery I don t rate restaurants on their administrative prowess but if I did I wouldn t give any to the TBC The waitstaff and management made it nearly impossible to process a reimbursement through the University of Illinois You would think given their proximity to campus that they would train people adequately with respect to how to handle the idiosyncrasies of receipt processing through the University Instead I am wasting my work and personal time chasing down the original receipt for a charge entered incorrectly by a waitress And the day manager can t help me Um I just recommend not going here at all if there is a chance you will need to then make your lifework sleuthing receipts Oh how fulfilling I ve heard other people say that it is always a nightmare to expense TBC meals The U of I area restaurants need to take a page from the book of vendors in other college towns and get their act together 
E0p4WS0LPOmrx1iatu3r4Q CMU Thanks to Big Grove we have a fine dining establishment that bases their menu on fresh and local ingredients I went there with my husband for our anniversary but I can easily see going back for a more casual meal or even for drinks and bar snacks Every table starts with slightly sweet popcorn and we were promptly visited by our friendly and helpful wait staff We had the chicken liver pate bistro filet house made sausage and the tater tots Everything we tasted was delicious I can t wait to go back and work my way through the menu 
E1FOIEKt83mfagTSU1S_Gw CMU I ve lived here for three years and eaten at probably every restaurant in Champaign and Bacaro is by far the best Bacaro has the best most professional servers the food albeit expensive is of the finest quality and the wine selection is unmatched in southern Illinois I ve eaten here at least 50 times and only had a handful of dishes that were not amazing and on that rare occasion the staff and chef were quick to make it right If you have a special occasion Bacaro is the only place in town you can completely trust to make the experience perfect The environment is very lively yet classy Make friends with your server and he or she will treat you like royalty every time you come in Thad the owner will bend over backwards to make sure you leave his restaurant happy and telling everyone about it Watch out though he may even get you drunk on fancy wine If you re new to Champaign and have the money you ll certainly want to become a regular here 
e4SboA9VEGz-59Ufm9H2DQ CMU Tried Prairie Fire for lunch today While there wasn t anything bad about this place there wasn t anything spectacular either I had the burger on a pretzel bun The pretzel bun was tasty and I would enjoy it again The burger was okay they didn t ask how I wanted it done so I expected it medium which it was but I would have preferred them asking what temp I wanted The chips were good but I would suggest adding cajun spice or something to make them more appealing The fries are not good The Garden Burger is actually tasty but nothing that would make me go back We might try it for dinner sometime Service was okay but they could be better 
e8-IRFiYaAdHSoX7geqetA CMU If all of the profs on campus hide out in a certain place you know it has to be good I always hear mixed reviews about this place from my friends but I m going to go ahead and give it a 4 This is my new favorite lunch place on campus for when you have time The sandwiches may be 1 2 more but are killer compared to other on campus options The grilled sandwiches may be a little buttery on the crust for some but it s perfect for me Last time that I went I got the grilled turkey sandwich which comes with caramelized onions and cheese Dinner options include fondue and pretty good pizza They also have some good bottles of wine on the list I ve ordered a bottle twice and been happy with what I got You might have to talk to one of the chefs if you want wine opinions since our server didn t seem to know much Really good atmosphere and decor it s casual fancy enough for pretty much anything and it s right next to Krannert if you need an after show dinner 
EadvOWGgFYsu2tW8a4FeKA CMU This place is solid It s cheap especially for campus The menu varies day to day which keeps things interesting You probably won t love every dish they make but there s little displays so you have a pretty good idea what you re getting The prices have increased a little from what other reviews say to 5 an entree for lunch and 0 75 for sides But I think it is usually worth that Some things I ve had here Pastrami on marbled rye was quite tasty Maybe not quite as flavorful as the Beef Stand but cheaper and closer for me Fried okra is the best I ve had in town Yum FSHN chips sandwich I was a little disappointed in this one there seemed to be less fish than breading Beer battered cod and chips was pretty good Mushroom and turkey panini also pretty good and satisfying on a cold day Manhattan clam chowder I liked this a lot it had a tasty broth and many chunks of fish I ll have to try the soups more often Overall since there are multiple dishes it seems like there s usually at least one thing worth trying I ve never had the salads or desserts but they look pretty good Service has been good every time I went though obviously this depends a bit on the students working I ve been pretty happy with the food I kinda like the cafeteria style set up and the price is right I ll be coming back here to try out more of the menu Great for a day when you forgot your lunch or just need a break and some tasty grub Since I found it it has become one of my regular lunch spots And you can look the menu up online before you even walk over http beviercafe illinois edu index cfm 
EfNZmhTNtFMrZaiPplUsWw CMU I went here for lunch with a large group I thought the menu selections were unique and gourmet We ordered the Fried Asparagus and they were lightly battered and fried to perfection Delicious My friend is Gluten Free and they have a menu just for GF items she had some type of pizza that looked and tasted delicious We didn t have any alcohol it was a work lunch so I can t speak to that 
EgpDLxgIOy6pXi1HrpPpOg CMU Tried it for the first time last night Had really good service It s a really nice atmosphere The food was fresh and there were a lot more meat options than I had expected Salmon crab shrimp They ve changed their dinner options to one bowl and unlimited I got the unlimited Tried a noodle soup with shrimp and warrior sauce It turned out so good and then got noodles with chicken with a combination of the peanut and chilling sauce Definitely going back I want to try their appetizers They looked so good on the menu 
EJFZg9MF0JptMbcWdJ6zmQ CMU If you have to drink on campus and you re over 18 I guess you have to drink at Murphy s Bad rude wait staff ok bar food and god awful teeny crowd after 7PM on pretty much any night I haven t been there since the addition so I have no idea if that took care of some of the overcrowding problems I sincerely doubt it did anything about the disgusting sticky floors 
eMCUWYTv9YvEDNhkDJD59w CMU Four girls squeezed into a booth Cue a movie waiter My friend named our waiter as someone you would see in a comedy movie or sitcom talkative funny ish and always popping up at random times for small chat Needless to say our server was very attentive e g good at recommending not recommending dishes clearing the table He skated the annoying line very closely never crossed it though so hurrah Food got thumbs up from us Med pizza really delicious and big for 9 Bison burger fries were a hit jambalaya and dopple chop it was good but pricey at 20 for what is received Drink wise Belgian pale ale ugh no a bit of an off taste torched cherry caiprissima too much lime juice for me but my friend loved it and don juan nice Overall a good experience But not a place I would have cravings for or feel the need to re visit It felt like a safe night out dinner Plus you can wear what you d like I saw fashions of all kinds without much judgment 
EPDlrMsTJeGn-UfMHdYGQQ CMU Come here regularly for lunch but never knew it was such a nice place for dinner The original plan had been Timpone s but apparently despite their website and store sign saying they open at 5 PM they somehow decided they wouldn t open till 5 30 and since I was too hungry to wait around for 30 minutes the excruciatingly loud construction out front did not help either I settled for Bread Company They re usually a soup and sandwich place during lunch but for dinner they completely switch up their menu filet mignon duck breast tapas and fondue On CAMPUS The food was absolutely delicious if slightly pricey 15 20 for an modestly portioned entree but if paying 20 some will get me amazing bread salad ahi tuna steak bread pudding and a mint iced tea all without leaving campus well then I m sold P 
eT3m0zEJN1lh02c4ZMIJxQ CMU I went to Silvercreek for lunch today with my dad and I feel like it s undervalued for lunch I had pesto rock shrimp pasta 8 25 and the most expensive lunch item and though I wish the menu had mentioned it was a light pesto cream sauce it was delicious and the garlic bread was awesome My dad had their burger of the day and he loved it too Our waitress was a little spacey but that ll happen Our entire meal including drinks and tip was still under 25 you can get a bill higher than that for lunch at places with far inferior quality of food 
Etp_XbboaShLaanySaGPyQ CMU The cookies here are amazing Especially the White Chocolate Pecan They are so rich and delectable I also had the South Western Fiesta Turkey and Corn Salad and the daily special which was Chicken Gumbo It all cost about 11 which is more than I was expecting to pay but I was very full The Salad was great And I NEVER like salads I generally go out of my way to pay extra for an alternative but I noticed that the salad today looked pretty good and I was glad I made that choice It was chock full of fresh vegetables juicy chicken and great taste The salads here are wayy bigger than the entrees I was not impressed with the Gumbo I can t put a finger on it but I have to say that the overall flavor was not appealing 
ETqmHWvVPScRKp--sRd25w CMU Warm popcorn in galvanized micro buckets greeted us with a wonderful crunch and delightful nibble while our beers arrived the deviled eggs were a true highlight Service was wonderful and there was an understated elegance and relaxation in the staff and the atmosphere Tiny smelt breaded and fried with lemon mayo were a hit the wonderfully seasoned pork belly with grits melted like chocolate as it entered my mouth However the special pork shank and beans seemed a bit of a miss and the mac and cheese although quite tasty was so large and rich and hot that it was difficult to enjoy maybe it could be a small appetizer side The chef at Big Grove definitely puts out quality tasty food that re imagines the standard Midwestern menu I applaud that However some of the details were slightly troubling out of draw item burger at 7 00 PM slight gaffe on menu These beers one dish that didn t quite work 3 5 
ETxEwpUHUK3HtZyF0Sbrmg CMU I still have dreams of Wednesday lunch Bacon Mega Cheeseburger and Fries for 4 I would give my left arm for a Murphy Burger on some days 
EXlFXL_whsh2-PHFaTgTYQ CMU This is my favorite of all the campus bars hands down Every Thursday night during the school year a club I m in takes over the basement pool tables darts and all to hang out in I can t even count all the great memories I ve made there Unfortunately on Friday and Saturday nights the lines build up pretty fast so it s best to get in before it gets packed In terms of food drink great fries great specials on drinks 2 Woodchuck Thursdays 
Ey7C0PfQrbQVI8RYloZVbA CMU I love the Destihl in Bloomington Normal so I had to give this one a try A co worker and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night The place was not overly busy but had plenty of business I really liked the decor of the place and the booth setup was neat Our waitress was very helpful and friendly I was happy to see that they have the same menu as the one in Bloomington Normal with only their beer selection being different We started with the Beer Battered Asparagus which was delicious I was tempted to get my usual the White Cheddar Stuffed Poblano Peppers but decided to change it up a bit I went with the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout It had wonderful flavor My co worker got my usual and she loved them too We decided to go for dessert as well I ordered the Creme Brulee I was not very impressed by this It was a bit on the runny side and I am used to creme brulee being smooth and creamy Overall great food and service Love this place 
F2UjTUgvjJI5O2Z8ovb-eg CMU I popped in here once for lunch last summer on the recommendation of my nutrition professor Our chat on carbs and training for races and triathlons led to you HAVE to go to the Bread Company Though this overly subtle carb stop doesn t have a sign anymore on its exterior it can be identified by the variety of wine bottles lining the window sills There s a variety of sandwiches for the lunch hour but I hit the Bread Company tonight and my do they swank it up for dinner Dim lights plentiful menu of pasta pizza sandwich options and extensive specials list including tapas Who knew I had the roast beef sandwich served atop roasted potatoes and a light salad I think all of the sammies are served up open faced so open your mouth and get ready for a carbolicious meal 
f60iOKW4cBqjV-fYFiSPlg CMU Big Grove is fine but that s all it is Unfortunately it just doesn t make sense to pay 15 for just a good hamburger If it were less expensive maybe more in line with Blackdog or Dublin O Neils prices it may have gotten 4 stars whereas those other restaurants get 5 stars and 4 stars respectively We started off with some deviled eggs that were good and a fresh baked pretzel that had an unappealing mustard sauce I ll take Gulden s over that mustard sauce any day I ordered the burger and my girlfriend ordered a chicken salad sandwich The burger was actually pretty good cooked medium with an egg and some onion maramalade on it The fries were decent but nothing to write about The chicken salad was just a terrible sandwich Maybe one small scoop of flavorless chicken salad on hard toast for 9 Get that thing off the menu Seriously People who order that sandwich will not come back The sweet potato chips on the side were pretty tasty though Overall not as great as I had hear though maybe the chicken salad ruined the experience You want a burger go to Blackdog or Farrens for a comparable one that costs half the price Want chicken salad better than this go to your local gas station and buy a pre made chicken salad All that said I ll give it another try 
fc4ZyKvdn3lwGuHSGJ2g3w CMU We have been to Silvercreek several times for lunch dinner and special occasions booked events in the greenhouse I ve always noted good service and the food is very good especially the house made breads This past weekend we tried the brunch for the first time and were delighted It is quite an extravagant lunch with MANY options and they were constantly refilling the trays so everything was fresh The waffles were fantastic light and fluffy the salads were fresh and the hot items were flavorful I was struck as a vegetarian with how many green vegetable options I had Brussels sprouts broccoli zucchini with cherry tomatoes spinach salad cucumber salad For meat eaters there were all sorts of coldcuts fish and seafood fried chicken beef and ham And save room for dessert there are almost as many dessert items available as there are main course so many cakes Along with tarts candy apple crisp bread pudding which wasn t very good the only thing I didn t like at all trifle and fruit This is the perfect place to bring visiting family or have a nice brunch out with friends Service for us was good though I did have a bit of a wait once for a water refill The only thing that was kind of surprising was the treatment of the line where the buffet is set up it s not ideal but it seems to work so so 
fDquTL_dSh-V-Ui7CcplmQ CMU Despite the lack of love for Destihl on Yelp I have to say I am besotted besotted bis tid Adjective 1 Strongly infatuated he became besotted with his best friend s sister 2 Intoxicated drunk Now I am currently the first definition of besotted with Destihl I LOVED my visit I went with Mr Husband and a Very Close Friend VCF before seeing a movie at the Art Theater Upon leaving I may have been the second definition of besotted Just kidding I only had one beer I swear my Yelp reviews make me sound like an alcoholic sometimes We went on a Monday evening around 6 We were seated right away Mr Husband and I had never been there and we were surprised how big the restaurant actually is it doesn t look that big from the outside Our waiter came over right away and gave us a nice little menu introduction I don t know why they ve made a restaurant based on the things I personally like but they did I wanted EVERYTHING on the menu Seriously I haven t had such a hard time deciding on what to order for quite some time VCF and I decided to split a small plate and an appetizer so we got the House Olives and the Bacon Egg Cheese deviled eggs For my meal I got the beer cheddar soup and the spinach salad VCF got the bison burger and Mr Husband got a special item a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries Food Very good but to be honest it could have been better If Yelp let me give 4 5 stars I would ve Everything was solid but there were a couple things that might just push it over the top For instance the house olives small plate It was agreed that it could be improved by serving the olives pre chopped not whole sort of a mix between an olive salad and a tapenade The deviled eggs were good but the yolk was just a bit stiffer than I would ve liked The beer cheddar soup was yum but the scallions would have been a little better more finely sliced The spinach salad was good but the maple in the maple jalapeno bacon dressing was a little too sweet and overpowered the other good stuff grilled portabella mushroom hell yes Another reason I m torn I love that they use ingredients from local places when possible and have put an emphasis on sustainable farming I m all for buying locally and supporting small farms and businesses On the other hand the way it s flaunted just strikes me as a tad pretentious Personal bias but still Service Another ALMOST 5 stars My only issue with our waiter was that he was TOO attentive Really friendly very knowledgeable about the menu gave good recommendations was able to tell us what HIS favorites are it drives me crazy when waiters have no idea what s good on the menu However he came by every 5 minutes or so I always have mixed feelings about that I like a server who is there when I need a water refill or a new fork etc but coming by too often just breaks up the conversation Ambiance Very cool Very big city I like it I also like that it s BIG Ample room between tables We chose a booth and it was perfect The noise level is ideal quiet enough to talk at a normal level loud enough that it doesn t feel like everyone in the area can hear what you re saying Dessert I can t tell you the last time I ordered dessert after dinner That NEVER happens I actually can tell you it was at my mom in law s birthday dinner in early October But VCF knows how to sweet talk me into sweets heh and our waiter was VERY convincing when telling us about the stout ice cream sandwiches which feature a housemade chocolate ice cream made with their own stout served on chocolate brownies Oh Mah Gah SO GOOD The stout ice cream was phenomenal The dessert consists of two sandwiches so you get four brownies and two scoops of ice cream This would be great to 5 out of 5 stars for the dessert Price Another 5 out of 5 stars I was expecting that I d have one entree and a beer We ended up with a ton of food For 38 77 before tip I saved my receipt we got A soda A 12 oz beer the Malius Apple Blonde Ale so good House Olives app Spinach salad Soup Bacon cheeseburger special 1 2 of the stout ice cream sandwiches So while I can t yet give Destihl a best of the best rating I m definitely a fan and certainly willing to give it another few tries I don t want to deter anyone from going here because my visit was truly enjoyable I m already planning to permanently take Jim Gould out of my date night lineup and replace it with Destihl I just want to acknowledge that there is some room for improvement I think with a tiny bit of tweaking Destihl could easily be one of the top restaurants in C U 
fG-FBcCIRak6-LLugVePGw CMU Destihl is an upscale pub style restaurant with a low key atmosphere The menu is quite large and has a lot of variety from small tapas style plates to salads pizzas burgers steaks entrees and even some thai fusion style dishes Because of the variety I think this is a great place to bring a group or a date if you re not sure what type of food they prefer Also the food ranges from The beer is all brewed at Destihl and is decent but I ve never been blown away by any of their brews I have been here several times and my favorite dish so far was the Cedar Plank Salmon On my most recent trip I ordered the Kobe Burger and when I ran out of sauce the server asked if I would like more I am not a dessert person but I LOVE their dessert menu So do yourself a favor and save room for dessert Be warned if you sit in the bar area be prepared to wait I have actually left a few times when I haven t been given water or a menu 15 minutes after arriving If you sit in the main dining room however the service is superb 
FIEB1bxvWlzax8KQ5_Qdgw CMU Our dining experience was generally poor There were few people in the restaurant and yet it took a very long time to take our drink orders get our food and bring our check Service was relatively slow given the buffet style setting I was part of a group of four and we all selected fried rice for our rice option however when our dishes were served we all found chunks of white rice in our bowls The roti bread felt stiff and dry and several of our bowls had bits of ingredients that weren t personally added Overall these issues make the dining experience unpleasant in general However in addition the food is over priced at 16 bowl plus 2 if you want to take your leftovers home I never thought I d say this but if you re in the mood for make your own stir fry Go to Flat Top in Campustown 
fjm78gEDLo29pdVEVqu_lA CMU The first time I went to Destihl I sat in the dining room things were okay The next time and every time since I have sat at the bar things were remarkable I enjoy having the direct interaction with the team of wonderfully skilled bartenders Their attention to detail and good cheer make the bar a must for anyone I take out in Champaign The roasted peanuts covered in delectable spices and drizzled with fresh lime juice make the perfect accoutrement to the always great fresh beer the bbq burger is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had 
FMQreKNQo8Cf6H4kZf1raQ CMU Good food nice quality and variety of ingredients love the sauce choices Also we went on a Monday and all beers were 1 OFF Not sure if this is a normal Monday thing but I like it Hats off to the owner there was a mishap and my food was messed up but the owner and chef were both very apologetic had my new and correct bowl cooked up as soon as I was done re making it and took half the price off of the meal for me Glad they made up for the mistake 
FoxOmzZQfOdXiOooYGkt-A CMU Over a year passed since I had last stopped by Houlihan s A friend recommended coming here for happy hour Based on my prior experiences I knew to keep my expectations low Instead I had a great time I came back a few days later and had another pleasant meal As far as chain restaurants go Houlihan s ranks well above average I ve skimmed the other reviews and I can t be sure if I ve just been lucky but I certainly didn t suffer the problems of other customers e g bland food poor service Lunch options are generously portioned and reasonably priced Complimentary soup or salad is served with entrees sandwiches wraps and pizzas I ve tried the baked potato soup and chicken tortilla soup and have trouble picking a favorite both are savory and very thick hearty If you re concerned about skimpy salads each of the signature salads come with a healthy proportion of greens to toppings candied pecans Gorgonzola cheese chicken etc The tapas style menu really makes this a fun spot for happy hour There are a LOT of options here more than 40 ranging in size from small to medium to entree size You ll find something even if you re a picky eater and Houlihan s takes special consideration if you mention being gluten intolerant vegetarian vegan etc I love being able to pick out a few things to share with friends but I can also see this as a great option if you have a light appetite and want truly modest portions of rich mashed potatoes or filling pasta Or if you have a diverse appetite and just want to eat bites of a lot of different things You can get small appetizer sized portions of their mac and cheese yum grilled skewers asparagus salad and white bean hummus DELISH I eat hummus as an appetizer at many places and while they vary in success I found Houlihan s hummus with grilled pita to be plate lickingly GOOD surprising especially for a chain The other essential element for happy hour are drinks and Houlihan s is stocked with a full bar along with a menu of suggested cocktails Some of these drinks are more sophisticated compared to the corn syrupy messes you get served at most chain restaurants For women watching their weight Houlihan s also serves a number of fruity drinks from the Skinny Girl brand great for minimizing the damage that restaurants can do to your diet 
fR_KiKrmCoYKamAGJIcq5g CMU Tranquil calm and romantic Wine bar is pretty decent and deserts taste good 
fvVL6ue1w2BwQOeCCrOcBA CMU This is usually where I m at if I go out to the bars it seems to have the least amount of crappy people you know what I m talking about if you ve been to any big state party school and not too expensive drinks Can get very very crowded and absolutely NOTHING Irish about it Irish nachos seemed to be waffle fries with nachos topping on them what the fuck like However they were delicious Their burgers made me real sick once but I got over it If I m going to a campus bar Murphy s is my first choice Plus they have lots of seating for us lazies 
Fw8OFe7JQ2KjFWEmlmnDDA CMU I went here for Lunch not too long ago and I was impressed They have a better layout than Flat Top but otherwise It s very similar Would definitely go there again 
fWRHULVPFOwKQT17-pXffg CMU I love this place The menu changes daily and now the cafe is using foods from local farms and businesses Prairie Fruits Farm Pekara bakery UI meat sciences dept As mentioned previously you can get a great balanced lunch for under 5 or get stuffed silly for maybe 7 they have 2 and under desserts that look tasty Some of the menu items sound a little strange but be daring because these kids know what they re doing I tried a cold salad with potatoes apples bacon candied walnuts and chicken yum Today I had indian stew with lentils veggies carrot bell pepper onion salmon and tilapia super yum It came with verrrry tasty fried pitas love it They always have lots of options for discriminating palates and take cards 
FxbErIVzV_o0ujWL3rnaVw CMU This is the best bar on Green Street I know that s not saying much but let me explain The drinks are cheap and really strong The music is ok there s an internet jukebox in the corner so it s generally a crapshoot The staff is very accommodating and courteous The patrons tend to be less pretentious than other green street bars and are just there to have a good time drinking There is no dress code but anything more than a polo shirt would be over dressed for guys 
GCZz0hCTCuo894JEzVVb-A CMU Well it s an institution here at the U of I You can get cheap brewskis and cheap burgers and neither are bad It s usually crowded Thursdays so I try to keep away 
gI78Rn-DKhAqf7H_macDSA CMU I enjoyed my trip to 301 Mongolia enough for a 4 star review For create your own stir fry the vegetables were fresh the meat was good and I liked the sauces very much The reason for 3 stars The price Lunch is 9 99 not bad but we went for dinner 15 99 definitely was steep esp since there was a 2 takeout charge For 11 99 or 12 99 even it was a quality meal I just wish there was a way to not have a 40 dinner bill for two meals and no drinks or appetizers 
Gikh-v8AKsT5fXDkGK20FQ CMU This truck is top notch sitting on Matthews nearly all day I walk by it nearly every day and have stopped a few times to get an excellent cup of joe They have used beans from Columbia Street Roastery in addition to some that were a Ethiopian blend The guy working the truck is great very passionate about coffee He is always friendly and will take a moment to explain any questions you may have The only issue I have is I wish they had some seating like some of the other trucks I wouldn t mind sitting outside on a nice day enjoying my cup of coffee Overall tasty coffee if you are passing by but not a place to lounge around They serve quality coffee and also have a small assortment of sides and sandwiches It is definitely worth a try as Espresso can become boring 
gmqXlAyZxFc2w3cndc13dw CMU One of my favourite restaurants in the area the 20 Sunday Brunch Buffet are totally worth it and do try the desserts The dinner is delicious as well Usually I don t rave about soups but their tomato basil soup was the best I ve ever had My husband who also doesn t necessarily like soups though it was delicious as well Silvercreek is worth the price and it is a good idea to make reservatiosn 
gNj2sZPD-vzVKh2FAk-mtA CMU Definitely a lot better than flattop grill on campus The quality of the meats are also an upgrade The sauce choices make for an adventure The lunch specials add value for those looking for a deal The desserts are pretty good make sure you try the chocolate filled wontons or the lemon ginger cheese cake The service can get slow sometimes this is the only negative 
GOHeO9dh0k1L1Xtyqu1Ihg CMU I don t LOVE this place but I wouldn t hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is craving a good place to eat stir fry Flat top Grill would be a direct competitor yet this place is much better They had a fresh array of vegetables sauces and meats seafood which is a HUGE plus They have Calarmari and Salmon for seafood lovers chicken beef and pork so theres something for everyone there is no vegetarian protein option The Servers recommend eating small portions so you can go up and try as many combinations as possible Also It is easier for them to cook with smaller portions as well Just remember to set your portions This place might be pricey for some but I believe its reasonably priced If you want the most out of your money I would suggest going there for lunch since it is only 9 95 for unlimited bowls My friend works at 301 so I got a great experience We started off with the Mongolian Nachos which I was quite impressed with it The chips were fried with wonton batter i believe and topped with a mixture of sour cream green onions tomatoes chicken I would definiltey give this a thumbs up and worth the try Once I got the bowls I went up and added all my ingredients but when i got to the sauces i was overwhelmed with all the choices Even using the small cups to try out the sauces didn t make my decision making any easier so I asked the chef for his suggestions and i was VERY happy with my stir fry I used sesame soy hunan and warrior The warrior gave it a little spice so don t put too much if you don t like spicy He suggested also the coconut curry peanut sauce warrior sauce and 301 BBQ sauce for more of a pad thai mixture which I didn t get to try We ended the day with the Chocolate wontons for dessert which I m sure would ve tasted 10X better if I wasn t so full It came out with caramel strawberry dipping sauces along with whipped cream so it was hard to turn them down Overall 301 was a great experience and would recommend to anyone unless you aren t craving for it TRY IT OUT 
Gs1skJzT6nPhLsYahHEiTg CMU Hey they are now serving local dishes every day There are many local farmers raising delicious top quality animals and heirloom produce which you can now eat for 5 
gWvxrsApSepM827qRadgxg CMU When our department has to entertain guest speakers or job candidates The Bread Company always becomes the default dinner lunch location Embarrassingly I ve heard some job candidates comment that they were taken here for 3 different meals during their visit My department is probably at fault for their lack of imagination when choosing restaurants but The Bread Company offers some benefits that elevate it to a top pick for business casual university diners 1 Location For people who have short lunch periods and need to be within walking distance of campus this restaurant s location is unbeatable And since it s next door to an Espresso Royale you can grab a coffee after your meal if desired 2 Atmosphere Most college restaurants resemble a McDonald s Playroom for adolescents neon walls and heavy duty plastic furniture with underlying scents of urine and vomit While The Bread Company does have a hint of grunge it also invokes a strong sense of urban artistic chic There are real paintings on the wall not poster prints At night they bring out white tablecloth and mood lighting 3 Price I think the prices are reasonable depending on who you ask This place IS pricey when compared to most campus restaurants where students are always trying to squeeze their dollars Lunch generally runs around 7 to 10 which is not unreasonable when entertaining guests And still comparable cheaper than what you can get at Timpone s the other nice restaurant in the area All of the food is fairly conservative with obvious combinations of flavors brie portobello turkey pesto etc I think this is also a reason that it ranks highly among options for guests you will find nothing offensive here in terms of food but also nothing exciting The presentation tends to be elegant and you can tell that most of the ingredients are of good quality For lunch I always go with the egg salad which is creamy well seasoned and always satiates my craving for egg goodness In the early evening sometimes I stop by for a beer and appetizer with friends The cheese selection is quite good you ll find Stilton Gouda Manchego etc and the beers are all microbrews if you re into that kind of thing Dinner selections include fondue pastas pizzas and some specialties but the prices are on par with more interesting restaurants in downtown Champaign Urbana In terms of baked goods I am quite fond of ordering my sandwiches here with sourdough or rye bread Yum At most places with a baking reputation I always find myself enticed by the sweet buns and cookies but I almost never find myself tempted by the ones at The Bread Company Their treats always look colorless and hardened as if they were made by an angry grandma Overall I d recommend this to people who like simple light food If you are cheap and don t care about indie street cred you could probably get the same food at Panera 
H2EGjK8mmmAeyVs-7adr6Q CMU This place was a bit of a disappointment for me I was really excited to try it since I heard the chef was an apprentice of Iron Chef Mario Batali yes I love the Food network The service wasn t great and even though it seemed fancy the decor wasn t all that great either The food is expensive which I was expecting but the pasta that I got was pretty bad and for some reason tasted a lot like bacon which I wasn t expecting Don t get me wrong I love bacon but not when it doesn t have bacon in it and isn t supposed to taste like that at all I definitely wouldn t go back here but it was an interesting experience 
H2io0fOkbLB66Thxp55GqA CMU Bacaro has been through some subtle but incredibly effective changes I am happy to say it has taken back it s rightful spot as both my favorite and simply the best restaurant in town and one of the my favorite spots anywhere As I mentioned previously the decor and staff are superb but Chef Thad Morrow is now to be seen frequently in the dining room and is doing a much better job of maintaining food standards than than the previous Maitre D Food is now flawless and portion sizes have increased somewhat too which for most was a welcome change There is also a new Bar snack menu which combines comfort food with nouveau twists like spicy homemade pork crackling Bacaro could compete on a world stage and do very well 
H2lKhptJuMgiwyU1A4yPFg CMU 3 5 for food 4 5 for drinks Destihl seems to have all the right ingredients to become THE hot spot downtown but I didn t leave it feeling like I really want to come back Service was very slow but since it s the first weekend of operation I m not going to take any points off The decor was really nice cosy and even a little cosmopolitan I got the pesto chicken pasta which I thought was good but nothing to get excited about I tried the fried cheese appertiser and while good they also weren t anything to write home about Overall food was good but not great There are better restaurants elsewhere The drinks on the other hand were good AND also reasonably priced which I did not expect They had a big beer wine cocktail and martini menu I tried a couple of different beers and they were all really good for the most part They also had 4 oz portion which was a great way to try different beers and the 4 oz portion is surprisingly not priced proportionally any higher than its 12 oz counter part Destihl seems like the ideal place to get dinner before a night downtown Great ambient great location great drinks and good food Even though it s not anywhere near there yet I m sure that it has the potential to be the best place in a couple of months 
H9trcMaj7V6PezTHmwEwbw CMU I just went to Bacaro for my girlfriend s birthday and got some mixed feelings about it Here s what we ordered Grilled veal chop with red beets and pearl onions Grilled sirloin with red cabbage potatoes and braised oxtail in a red wine reduction Apple cake with creme fraiche ice cream Chocolate brownie with graham cracker ice cream and roasted marshmallows Persimmon and pistachio bread pudding The entree and wine were splendid although a bit on the salty side for the sirloin However the dessert left a lot to be desired in particular the persimmon and pistachio bread pudding It was just plain soggy and tasteless I recommend not ordering dessert here if you do plan on coming In regards to the waitress and hostess they were very helpful and courteous in contrast to many of the other reviewers who saw them as snooty and pretentious The atmosphere was pleasant and the ambient music was suitable for the occasion 
HBBX1NfSjw-NH3jq7ZWAsg CMU Murphy s Pub really is a great college bar It tends to have a rather diverse mix of people isn t usually overly loud and a great value The drink specials are quite good and the choices on tap are plentiful Food is good for bar food definitely get the Irish nachos sometime There really isn t anything Irish about them but they are delicious 
hDk4gILHVPGxI_mt-XNavw CMU I want to like this place I really do The food can be quite good I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the service which has been some of the worst I have received in Champaign Urbana More on this shortly I love select dishes on the menu but I feel like you have to know what to order The burgers are INCREDIBLE I never want to eat another burger that is not a mix of beef bison and pork Awesome And the fries with it are great As much as I enjoy the burgers there are times that you want some variety I know that it is trendy to include deviled eggs on a menu but this are nothing special However I feel like the pretzel makes up for this The pretzel is great and if you like your mustard with a HEAVY amount of spicy horseradish this is for you I also really enjoyed the pork belly but wish it was larger than just a starter All of that being said all of my recent experiences there have been a service disaster We have enjoyed going for the Friday outdoor concert series because we can sit outside and enjoy dinner a beer and the music In fact until the service problems began we would go every week religiously Earlier in the summer the service was not a problem However the past several times we have gone we have literally had to BEG to be waited upon Each of these times we have arrived been seated and then waited for 20 30 minutes before any server came to our table to even take a drink order We have had to ask the hostess or manager some times several times in the same meal to have one of the wait staff come to our table just to take an order The last straw was when the same friend was there for TWO DIFFERENT MEALS IN A ROW seated at an entirely different table and she too was talking with the management to try and get someone to take our order The paranoid person in me worries that this lack of service is because we came with a small child Our child is quite well behaved in a restaurant but we try to be courteous and go for very early dinners when we know she will not be a problem We always try to order the full meal drinks dinner dessert up front and ask that the bill be given to us when the drinks arrive so we can make a quick get away if necessary My point is that this is the one time that we actually get to go out and enjoy an adult meal and activity and I don t want it regularly spoiled by bad or nonexistent service regardless of whether or not it is because I have a child with me I have wasted this time for several weeks in a row at Big Grove and don t plan on doing so again for a long time There are plenty of other options in the area 
hjA50L0ejYxmzEjsrO2KJA CMU Good food Were facinated by the bar bits and starters so decided to go with a nosh dinner had smelts pickeled veggies pate parsnip and celery root soup deviled eggs chopped salad and mac cheese All the food was good and for a newly opened restaurant the service was amazingly together We even had a wine by the glass which was corked and they fixed it without problem The wine list was not deep but what they had was reasonably priced All in all if you were looking for a gastro pub in Champaign this fits the bill 
HjilOOdwqHWjnOwsXQK6_A CMU Decent drinks chill atmosphere Irish Nachos oh God yes lack of sketchy people grinding on you WIN 
HkxoJjyuVmQwDQcJwdhd2w CMU Decent food but not spectacular The grilled watermelon salad sounded better than it actually was it was drenched with vinaigrette Anyway I had the scallop dish which was cooked nicely but slightly bland I think the wine here is better had a really awesome special pinot grigio with literally peaches floating around It was so great I have to come back here to try more of their wines I think it s probably better to come here just for wine than for dinner And like what everyone else said the service was great 
HmMUUrWfI8Y2gZnG7HHGSg CMU I had the 6 course tasting flight tonight at Bacaro and it was incredible My friend and I ate and drank wine for 3 hours and I felt completely taken care of but not intruded upon by our totally awesome knowledgeable helpful waiter the entire time 100 thousand props to said waiter who didn t give the check to my male dining companion just because there were two of us and my male dining companion was male I can t agree with the other reviewers about the portions I was FULL by the end of the third course and still had half a meal to go I think if I had even just ordered the linguini that was our 3rd course I still would have been full This is definitely a special occasion kind of restaurant but I will certainly go back if I ever have a special enough occasion again 
hnEFQ3vckeI32L6wNVsJFw CMU I am trying to think of what to add that hasn t been said I think this is one of the outstanding restaurants in Champaign Urbana I have had many meals there most were superb but this is reality and once in a while I have been disappointed as can be seen in some reviews Overall they rock This is not the typical american italian restaurant Perhaps it is more helpful to think of the Italian philosophy to place importance on food that is local fresh and in season As this would indicate the menu changes frequently This is not an all you can eat for cheap place Portions are human sized and thus smaller than what we have become used to having to carry out in a bag or leave on the plate Prices reflect the cost of quality ingredients and a skilled staff There s a nice wine list that favors Italian varieties The staff can make good recommendations One more thing that is not well known they are now open for lunch Tuesday Friday And why do I compliment highly acknowledging it is far above others in the region yet gave 4 5 stars I have to save a star there are better restaurants in the world 
HP0QN4W_8qB3O1Wy5HhX1w CMU Went here for dinner with a few colleagues There was spacious seating so it was a great place for groups Had the Dijon chicken with asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes I was kind of put off by the dark color of the sauce but the whole entree was pretty good chicken was flavorful and tender too For dessert I had the baked apples which was good but nothing unique Our waitress was very attentive but her attentiveness seemed to taper off as the night went on 
HPcbrMVlQyWK9VHroDRgUQ CMU This is my choice for a beer and greasy pub grub This is the only place around that has 1554 on tap so I may be partial The food isn t anything to fawn over but is good and cheap enough to wash down with a beer 
HPjSEb2x-PjUocZWbBbPlQ CMU Dad s day needs a step up on the C U restaurant ladder don t you think We made a reservation at Silvercreek and were so glad to have this beautiful WARM and welcoming spot to retire to after another bitter loss on the field The lunch menu is not quite as diverse as the dinner menu but we all loved our entrees We started with the corn chowder which was filling and nuanced My husband had the special pork tenderloin and my daughter and I had the vegetable ravioli rich and delicious Plus the best bread basket in town I was a tad diaspointed in the chocolate cake beautiful but the taste was dull That cake looked so much better than it tasted Had the dessert been better this would be a five I have been there multiple times and have long felt this is the weak link in an otherwise great restaurant When the football team disappoints the food will not I L L I N I 
HpqCRe8aUe6LE9rj3S_jWw CMU I ve been to the Bread Company at least 6 times over the past three years all separated by months The only reason I continue to go back has got to be because I forget about how sub standard their food is And today I decided to finally put my disappointment on the internet This review was spurred by a visit today to get coffee and a pastry I ordered an americano that was obviously made with poor quality espresso and perhaps by someone with little knowledge of what an americano should be It was too watery but maybe that is my taste I also had what they dared to call a chocolate croissant It could have been made days ago Instead of being light and fluffy it was dense and doughy and filled with chocolate chips that were never fully melted so they maintained their chip structure I was less than impressed But this seems to be the way things go at the Bread Company As I mentioned earlier I have been going to the Bread Company for quite a few years having been at the U of I as a student since 2008 and their menu has yet to change At all This sort of stagnancy is worrisome and really speaks to the lack of effort that the chef and or owner put into this business On a recent dinner visit I got the chocolate fondue which came with possibly pre made cinnamon bread slices strawberries and a plethora of apples and pears I suppose the apples and pears were in season it was November when I went but I don t see how apples work with chocolate I ve had their pizza many times and I cannot deny that they do a good crust but I just don t get the pizza that comes with a mountain of salad on top It is just too much and overwhelms the pizza that really should be the star of the dish Overall the Bread Company is uninspired and very tired This is reflected in their dusty unchanging interior their menus and the often impolite lackluster performances of the staff 
hQ6Js9srvSJuLq1KJ_7L4g CMU I agree with the first review I get the feeling it is a step up from Friday s but is a bit more trendy and refined I was impressed nonetheless The lighting was intimate and a great start to the evening of debauchery ahead I had the herb grilled chicken Healthy delicious As a desert my date and I split a creme brulee and a white chocolate banana cream pie HEAVEN on my Houlihan s table 
HU2L_JvqApqa6COIHx_v0w CMU Murphy s has always been my favorite bar on campus and somewhere I have gone consistently as my first bar choice It s a very chill bar but at the same time can be crazy fun with some great music and good company The jukebox there is always a fun way to get the night going and they always have a huge selection of songs to choose from Also it s the place to be these days on Thursday nights as the lines can get insanely long and have up to 30 40 min wait times depending on the night So my advice to you would be to arrive around 9pm 9 30pm to avoid any lines cause as soon as 10 o clock rolls around you ll be waiting a little bit to get in The specials are always nice with the 7 killians on Thursday and 2 Pints for Bluemoon how could you go wrong Also with the new area that opened up the wait for drinks has gone down to much shorter Love the new space and the addition of the air hockey table in the basement as well In addition the food is delicious Best burgers and fries on campustown The double cheeseburger deal on Wednesdays i think might have to check on this is amaziiinnnng Overall this bar is chill and fun at the same time It s not as chill as Legends granted Legends may have more seating but I don t think you ll get the same experience when comparing the bars 
i-0Yz644F4_cNLK3K-Z_tQ CMU Destihl ness is the move They ve only been open a few weeks but I m predicting that this place is going to become an institution here in Champaign Urbana They re not quite there yet BUT this four stars is partially based on potential I don t know if that s acceptable for Yelp but whatever I will admit I got a little gluttonous this evening Ideally I wouldn t have eaten as much as I did but it was what it was I started off with some of the home brews I did the the little 4 oz guys and out of the four I tried I liked three enough to drink again the Belgian ale was a bit too hoppy for my liking At 1 25 each or 5 for the 4 I don t mind one I didn t like Next I went with the beer cheese soup WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT It was amazingly good Also at my table were some cheese curds and I will dare say that these curds were the finest curds I have ever eaten and I ve had them in Wisconsin too For my entree I went with the bison burger which was flavorful although I will echo the review who noted that their meat was overcooked and I appreciated that fries were included The fries were awesome shoestring style and were not oversalted but weren t seasoned improperly either just right For dessert it was baked apples with butter pecan ice cream It was wildly decadent and irresponsibly delicious The service is not awful but you can tell that the servers are still getting their feet wet No worries though The food was totes worth the wait I ll be back no doubt and I m pretty sure I ll be updating with 5 stars 
i2XH8-9TGB5kRFVGh2pdUQ CMU Where to start OK I always thought that Silvercreek was a good place to go if you were A Old B White and C middle class and want to feel good about your middle classness Which is why I never went because I A Feel old B am really white and C am horribly middle class I don t like to go places where I all I see is clones of myself but we went to Silvercreek for the first time 10 days ago and have already been back another time since First things first the decor will suit anyone s parents but isn t so stuffy and lame that you want to rip the crocheted crap off the walls and scream The service is good although knowledge of the wine list could be better from both servers so far The menu is really interesting with a lot of options and some cool creative twists on some meals which would otherwise be your typical American bistro fare Prices are worth it HUGE portions generally speaking but the pork chop especially is Massive and the Hangar steak notsomuch I fully intend on going back frequently 
i2XzSB47B7CKWjexHuCiVg CMU This is delicious I had never been to a Houlihans before and it is great At lunch I get the mini burgers and salad combo and it is great a little pricey If it was 7 95 or so I think that it would be a better deal but the food is really good At dinner time they have a menu that included mac and cheese for 6 and it is GREAT This is a place worth going 
iE9VSMZ7oRblPfjI5b3IlA CMU The food here is just plain terrible Quantity is all they aim at while forgoing quality I actually think this one and great impasta are by far the worst restaurants in town As an Italian I can tell you this food has nothing what so ever to do with Italian cuisine If I could I would give them negative stars 
IKu8zTOOIrsZCb5RT-i72g CMU Sarah is a lovely server and the vegan menu is awesome This is the only nice place in town with an explicitly vegan menu other than a skuzzy basement place My vegan meal and my husband s Swiss inspired pizza were great better than ever and the vegan carrot cake s delight surprised my husband with it s moist scrumptiousness The chef was honestly satisfied as he heard reports of our satisfaction I have always liked The Bread Company but tonight I declared it my favorite Yes to Bread Company 
ILdCBT9CkkILAWJ0d8FCNA CMU great food and tons of choices although i was overwhelmed with the sauce selection better to eat at lunch time it s cheaper and it s unlimited tip if you are going for seconds after handing off your 1st bowl to be cooked go sit down and ask for another bowl and then go make that one and that way your eating the 1st bowl while your 2nd bowl is about to be or is being made i learned my lesson the previous 2 times iv e dined there when it took 15 to 20 minutes to make my 2nd bowl lunch time it s 10 95 at night it s 13 95 
iLjQAI2N8XJ09xkd61tUlw CMU So when it comes to stir fry in Urbana Champaign it was always flattop grill Now flattop grill is no longer the monopoly in town and 301 Mongolia are its number 1 rivals I went to 301 Mongolia last weekend and I have to say it is my new number 1 stir fry place in town The meat are much more fresh less frozen and there is better variety in comparison to flattop The sauces are much more interesting and fresh since they are homemade and you get a deeper bowl which is much less messier Now I know the dinner price might be a bit too much since it is 20 dollars but a fair argument is that it is unlimited amount of food that you can eat the restaurant ambience is very nice too I m giving this place 4 stars because of the little pricy dinner bowl Other than that im definitely going again some time soon 
ItyUgQ6O95Nzi9aKvkJBuw CMU I don t think I ll be going back to Espresso Royale soon Sometime in November this coffee truck started appearing on Matthews Ave Curious I checked it out Prices seemed reasonable and I had just been lamenting the lack of good small coffee places in town The Candide coffee truck has been a pleasant surprise I ve been a few times now When they first opened they had cheap lattes and free samples as a promotion The latte was very good I could taste the milk and it was nice and frothy The mocha sample was pretty good but mochas are a little sweet for me The energy drink had a nice citrus flavor Since then I have also tried their regular coffee and some of the pastries The regular coffee today was an Ethiopian single origin More importantly I took a sip and really liked it It had a nutty flavor and tasted good which was a great surprise While I like coffee I am more used to guzzling down machine coffee or burnt tasting coffee just for the necessary caffeine I actually enjoyed the flavor of this one and the price wasn t bad about 2 for a small I got a pumpkin chocolate muffin as well which was tasty and went well with the coffee One of the people I work with got a peppermint mocha here and it comes with bits of peppermint candy sprinkled on top Nice touch I ve seen sandwiches offered from Cheese and Crackers there as well haven t ordered them at the truck but I know those sandwiches are good and will check it out next time I forget my lunch The service is really good the guy serving is friendly They take credit cards too which is nice for a food truck So in conclusion check it out I ll be going back 
J0Ka3hGuFosefVa0ucJH8g CMU I wanted to come back and let ya ll know that Destihl has recently become vegan friendly The marinated cucumbers and beer battered asparagus are both vegan as is and Destihl has added an 8 oz veggie burger to their menu that can be made vegan if the mayo s left off I believe there are a few other items that are vegan the peanuts and the chips are sans ranch dip but I haven t confirmed them with the chef so I ll leave you to figure that out on your own 
j33rabfysSEn5MKn72KA7Q CMU With an emphasis on locally sourced foods and a chef from California we were hoping the local food movement could come to Central Illinois as successfully as it has in Northern California excellent innovative and well prepared food that supports local farmers and ranchers while often exceeding the expectations of diners Alas it is not to be In spite of many available tables we were seated in a dark and cavernous all in black alcove Although elsewhere it was the bright light of day we were barely able to make out the menu in the darkness We ordered wine by the glass to start they waved the bottle over the glass and delivered a very small quantity for a full price pour Actually I like the option of small glass but only if they offer the option of paying accordingly I ve had larger pours at free wine tastings around town Illinois is beer country and as they are going local perhaps we would have been better to order a local brew We waited a long time for our food allowing our meager splash of wine to warm in the glass so as to save the few swallows to have with our meal At long last when it arrived the spouse s was pleasant enough but mine was not at all as described I had ordered the chicken salad on wheat bread with greens one of the few sandwiches that did not say it was served with chips All flavors were erased by a thick layer of Dijon mustard and it was served on very dried out toast with chips on the side The greens were a piece of lettuce inserted between the mass of mustard and the dried out bread The person at the next table ordered the same dish and had the same impression asking the waitress where the greens were and commenting on the dried out toast It was supposed to have tarragon and other interesting ingredients but every flavor was eclipsed by the strong Dijon mustard Don t know if it was the worst lunch I had since moving here last summer but it was clearly the most expensive bad lunch I have had approaching 50 for two sandwiches one nearly inedible and a smidgeon of wine This was very expensive for mixed quality not a good value Pluses I like that they are trying to source from local farms although I missed having a fish or seafood option on the menu The staff was very friendly Minuses Expensive very small portions descriptions on menu not accurate food quality uneven some bad seating locations I gave it two stars for the effort to source locally and the friendliness of the staff I a willing to give them a try again in a couple of months to see if they iron out the kinks but only if I am feeling extravagant 
ja7U_V_n3fu1mSmDh2d63w CMU Two key points 1 Lunch cheaper laid back 2 French fries with garlic aioli fatty deliciousness You must ask for the aioli They have a decent lunch though I really just go for the french fries Other lunch food worthwhile tomato bisque chicken salad wrap and grilled cheese I was never in a burger mood when there but I see a lot of people ordering it Service here often becomes great fodder for conversation afterward I mean there was a waitress who was super perky and nodded vigorously whenever I asked for something to then come back happily each time completely forgetting that I asked for anything at all I forced a friend to steal sugar from tables because of her And another waiter who ran around in a rush as if someone was holding a gun to him and ordering him to drop those checks off stat 
jB_zNXM5RBywzDuBnz0uoQ CMU I was really expecting much better things from this restaurant Based on the good reviews and seemingly more upscale menu I thought this would be a nicer restaurant with good decor and great food Well not so much My friend and I showed up around 7 30 on a Friday night and the place was only about half full That should have been our first hint The restaurant has a rather strange look what with the exposed brick and ceiling beams combined with the country style tables carpet and booths Overall it just looked a little dated and old especially the booths that were in a bit of disrepair The dinner menu isn t huge and has a handful of selections for seafood steaks and pasta I opted for the potato crusted whitefish It came with a cream sauce asparagus mushrooms and carrots It came out nicely presented but when I lifted up the outer potato crust and got a glimpse of the actual fish I was so annoyed I m not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that piece of fish was 2x2 inches Maybe you re not supposed to notice that with all the potato lumped on top of it but at 18 that was absolutely ridiculous My friend said her lobster mac and cheese was good but so rich she could only eat half And BTW it was corkscrew pasta not macaroni Sadly I didn t order a salad because those actually looked pretty good And there was also a good looking maple banana cake but I refused to spend any more money there so I can t attest to the desserts Overall this place is way way overpriced and I would never go back 
JKWF-frNoPCNVs6T_yYEYQ CMU Nothing really special Its a college bar in a college town The typical bar food but fries come free with any sandwich on Sundays I think I find it odd that your order from a window and your number is called I mean the place isn t exactly set up like Panera Nevertheless I was okay with my fish sandwich 
JnGAO_znA_1-5HddA7H3DA CMU A lot better than the nursing home kitchen that used to be in this spot The table popcorn would make Sacagawea proud My turkey sandwich had no idea as it sat upon my plate that it would soon become the best fucking turkey sandwich to ever grace my sweet filthy mouth I will be back The water glasses are kindergarden sized which isn t a problem if your staff is well trained to keep them full Our server was on top of it but no water glass could be filled without an excuse me or I m sorry I just need to grab there thanks or would you like more water Just fill my goddamn glass until it s over fucking flowing and don t interrupt my lunch conversation Of course I want more water It s still pretty affordable is it not Be generous And even if I didn t need additional water I would sooner watch you silently pour water into my glass until the fucking floor was wet than engage in a pro con discussion about whether to refill my fucking cup Just fill it up like Kevin McAllister s uncle told the flight attendant 
jOSnv8s0uiCtvfyBk-CjWw CMU In my opinion a good brewpub has great beer with good food to accompany the beer Maybe it iwas the fact that we checked it out 4 days after it opened but of the 5 beer styles we got 4 of them were off One was clearly oxidized badly one was infected to lacto and tasted very funy and the other two mildly oxidized We hoped the manager would come visit with us but no luck The bartender indicated that depending on the time of day the beer tastes different from the yeast First time I have heard of that Food was decent but I have had better pub grub Maybe the beer just ruined my taste buds Positive The pizza is HUGE enough for two to share or one very hungry person Hopefully they figure things out Have been frequently brewpubs throughout the US in the last 12 years and can honestly say it was the oxidized beer and infect beer were the worse I have ever had Even my earliest botched homebrews were not that off Gave it two stars since it was the first week it was open and the possibilities it was growing pains 
juCyfAE-oqygHO749u9_Cg CMU By far best restaurant in CU 
JvNmjXrNgbCSk3NF78OL_A CMU This is probably the best restaurant in Urbana First of all they bake their own bread and fresh pastries are available for breakfast everyday My favorite is the cheese gruyere croissant because it is so flaky It literally melts in my mouth My coworker called it high class junk food but I call this good stuff Sometimes when I felt lazy to go to lunch I would just buy a loaf of bread and eat that with a cup of coffee The zufte or zoft which is a Swiss specialty bread is amazing It is fresh and out of the oven by 11am during school days I have not seen other places in the area that sell zufte but the bread is really worth trying Oh if you have cravings for day old bread they sell them at half price They also have a wonderful selection for dinner Daily specials change quite often but they have their regular dinner menu I usually go with the daily special This place also has fondue both cheese and chocolate I had both and I have to say that they are pretty stingy with their cheese and chocolate I had barely enough to cover the fruit or bread Do expect 12 17 for entrees and about 10 for fondue By the way they sell cheeses too in the day They have pretty good service but the people do not seem to smile a lot during the day especially the owner They should be happy because of the wonderful smell of fresh bread The decor is a little European and has a fireplace at the corner which makes the place extra cozy in the evening Anyhows this place is highly recommended I am sure you ll love it 
JZOg4cEB_eIv8T6CXBgbFQ CMU Houlihan s is kind of a pseudo fine dining version of a TGI Friday s The menu is similar to what I would expect from TGI Friday s but the decor is a lot more trendy right down to the super obnoxious aluminum menus Although the menu items are fairly pedestrian they have little twists chevre on the bruschetta instead of the more expected mozzarella for example and there is a big focus on presentation This makes for wonderful looking food but the taste doesn t quite hit the mark Some of the cool looking little food sculptures are also very difficult to eat My bruschetta came with a little minced olive tower that looked like a cross between a wine cork and something out of the cat box which was none to appetizing Most of the food I had tasted OK but the fried asparagus stands out as being notably bad One of my pet peeves is tough asparagus and the stuff here was enough to make me go postal It was over breaded over cooked and the asparagus was actually chewy Gross I couldn t bite through the asparagus so when I tried to eat it the asparagus slid out of the breading leaving a pile of greasy panko straws on the plate The horseradish dipping sauce was good but lacked zing At 10 for a dozen bad pieces of asparagus this should definitely be skipped As is usually the case with chains the menu descriptions made the food sound divine but the taste did not live up to it It s not bad mind you it s just forgettable This was particularly the case with the mini desserts which are actually full sized desserts one is plenty for two people Thinking they were much smaller than they turned out to be we got a 6 trio of pecan pie banana cream pie and chocolate cake All were very cold as if they had just been removed from a long stay in the fridge All were also very bland and had terrible texture The pies were both runny and the chocolate cake was dry and made Hostess cupcakes look gourmet Like everything else they looked fabulous and were also very reasonably priced but don t let that fool you They re really not worth it So overall I give Houlihan s a resounding meh It s not bad but I certainly didn t find it to be particularly good I m giving three stars because the service was better than I would expect from a newer place so close to campus and they definitely deserve credit for having such a well trained and capable staff 
k5UlGtCokfSE2XdWbdKMCA CMU My husband and I along with two other couples decided to celebrate the end of the semester tonight by going out After much debate we ended up at The Bread Company As a former music major this was one of my usual haunts but the rest of them hadn t been there quite as frequently Lunch by the way is excellent they have excellent sandwiches and salads The specialty of course is the fondue which is magnifique My only gripe is that portion sizes tend to vary widely from time to time as does the selection of vegetables that comes with your meal The combination of cheeses though is great and the bread and potatoes are wonderful Tonight though I had one of their specials which was good but was actually my third choice of menu items They were out of the fettucine with salmon AND out of the chicken pizza Now I don t pretend to understand the inner workings of the restaurant business but it really irritates me when they run out of something To me that just smacks of poor planning Do they not have a kitchen Can they not make more If not then can they not provide accurate estimates of how much of each food item to make so they won t run out I don t know but it just seems like when you go someplace you should be able to look at the menu with confidence Anyway the beef fondue I had was very good and one of my dinner companions adored her trout She said it was the most moist fish she had eaten in quite some time and she is a fish lover Her husband a reasonably picky eater devoured his pancetta pizza with no complaints as did another friend with his salmon I thought the portion sizes of some of the meals were pretty small especially given the price Still it s good food and worth the money especially when you consider it s not that expensive Service was pretty good although a little slow particularly since they weren t that busy tonight My guess is she just had a hard day We love the Bread Company and will continue to visit but probably just for the fondue We know they ll have it and we know it s good Thanks for a fun evening 
kADOYFARIVLMlJ32sDt8jw CMU Houlihans constantly underwhelms me and by constantly I mean the two times I ve gone there I think that for the quality taste of food it s way over priced I have had the SW chicken wrap which mentions jalepenos but I found it incredibly bland My dad liked his sandwich but it was like ham and cheese with mixed greens it s not that hard The decor is cool I just think the prices are a little bit ridiculous for the quality of food in Champaign 
KaDZ8_t9Q545T85Zf2gdEg CMU This is our favorite restaurant in Champaign Urbana A little pricey but worth every penny Incredible wine selection and a staff that loves to help you find that perfect food and wine pairing 
KKiHGFeB8SUlUaMEn2BWAA CMU Something has got to be done about the abominable service at The Bread Company It s such a shame because their food is not bad but the service is so badly below standard I decided I am simply never coming back here There is one particular worker with tattoos on his arm who is very insolent towards customers raising his voice at them for asking questions For months I ve ordered a grilled sandwich to pick up for lunch time and the result is totally random If the owner tall bald guy is there when you call chances are you ll get a good sandwich with the potatoes and salad on the side but if he s not there watch out there s no telling what you ll get Sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich sometimes they don t Sometimes they slice the sandwich sometimes they don t Sometimes the sandwich is available since the grill is on and other times it s not even available since they turn off the grill in the middle of the day to save money randomly Today for example I went to pick up my grilled sandwich to go and was surprised to see that on this occasion there were no potatoes and salad included even though two weeks ago I ordered around the same time and they were included So I asked the short haired lady in front of me behind the register are there potatoes and salad pointing at the sandwich and she stared directly at my eyes without answering So I repeated the question and she stood there completely quiet staring at me without answering when the tattooed arm punk butted in our conversation cocked his head at me and yelled didn t we go over this already Don t bother coming here Unless the owner fires some of the incompetent and insolent flunkies buzzing behind the counter soon this place needs to go out of business ASAP 
KraE3toCYy6uGUtobuLajA CMU i really wanted silvercreek to be better than it actually was especially because it is one of the only fancy sit down places walking distance from my apartment i went on a monday night the week after valentines day my friend and i wanted to start with the mushroom puff pastry appetizer but the valentines crowd had apparently wiped them out so we opted for the potato pancakes which looked fantabulous but one bite covered in white wine cream sauce had us puckering up so bad the sauce was so sour that we could barely finish the first bite both of us ordered pasta dishes as our entrees he the lasagna i the gnocchi the lasagna was ok really nothing special at all the gnocchi was in a subpar tomato sauce and the gnocchi was overcooked to this dry powdered mashed potatoes type consistency it couldn t choke more than a few dumplings down the dessert however was delicious warm chocolate brioche bread pudding topped with vanilla ice cream super win i will be back if only because i have to check out this friday happy hour that is so well spoken of perhaps the steaks and chops or the chicken and fish are a better choice we shall see 
Ku8c3USYh6nzlMb_bAEL4g CMU A fine mid day watering hole Good beer specials including 1 50 pints of Point on Fridays The teriyaki chicken sandwich is average a little too heavy on the teriyaki but the bacon cheeseburger on Friday is excellent The fries are thin and decent but need salt and ketchup Good soups in winter including a deceptively good beer cheese soup Check it out 
LcSlrqtBnt-J6sz_JSXjaA CMU The problem with this concept is that the food is only as good as YOU make it If I were king of this castle I would have some pre established recommendations for those of us not well versed in sauces and combinations They also don t mix any of the rices with your stir fry but they may do it if you ask Also someone in my party had shrimp in their dish that were part of someone else s dish sloppy Overall though I would go there again because I found a combination that I liked The server s were great the decor was great and I liked the background music If you are a vegetarian and like a mostly noodle dish I recommend the lo mein noodles with carrots mushrooms baby corn and broccoli My sauce was 2 parts teriyaki one part garlic water one part ginger water and 1 2 part of pineapple sweet and sour 
lCwgmQZT7H9f8tgCePtt-Q CMU J pointed out 301 Mongolia to me on our way in to Destihl the night before and I must admit I was pretty excited to try it out as we both love Flat Top Grill So when she informed me that s where we were going for dinner the next night woohoo When we arrived around 7pm on a weekday I was impressed by the look of the place Personally I loved the muted red color of the globe lights and the open feeling of the restaurant The hostess and our server were friendly Practically empty customer wise I perused the food options as we were seated and liked the variety of veggies sauces and proteins So far so good We ordered drinks and an app the Mongolian Nachos I liked my Martini another smooth sipping winner J s Margarita packed quite a liquor whallop and I hated te nachos even with some help from sauces from the stir fry bar it was dull city On to the main event and I ll compare my finds at 301 to Flat Top for those of you who ve tried FT 301 had more basic veggie choices no premixed stir fry veggie bins and a whole bin of bean sprouts yah my fav stir fry veg There appears to be an equal amount of sauce choices at both locations but the sauce flavors at 301 were not as robustly seasoned 301 had many more protein choices than FT but no vegetarian options that I could see FT kicks butt on veg protein options I was able to make my 301 stir fry into a soup but there was not enough broth and the flavor just wasn t there and I swear I put 6 ladles of sauces into my stir fry 301 had more herb and spice shakers too 301 s roti bread was good and they ll give you extra same as FT but FT s roti is just amazing If I m craving stir fry in Champaign I ll stick with Flat Top 
LIBo3nUgyTCsaxsX-U8Mtg CMU Ohhhh the murphyburger how I loved thee Best damn burger in town The mushroom cheeseburger was my favorite and the fries oh so good Extra pickles please I went back to campus a few years ago and found they had expanded it s a little disconcerting but at least the food is still the same Go Murphy s 
lJTbuHcdbqD_a8LPrgJs-A CMU Wow I wouldn t be surprised if this became one of my favorite lunch spots on campus I went today and really liked it I got one of their grilled sandwiches turkey pesto and it came with gruyere cheese and grilled red onions delicious It s not extremely cheap I paid around 7 50 but the cold sandwiches go for 5 50 or so so there definitely are cheaper options to eat around there but the food is good so it s worth it in my opinion On top of that I like the place and the atmosphere They also sell bread as you might guess and have wine by the glass I can t wait to check it out for dinner 
LoafxkzNAeqF-7mzTAeWSQ CMU This is one of the best places to eat in the CU The line for lunch is out the door and a little pricey but it s very good At dinner the restaurant becomes full service and the lunch items go up in price but there is a much larger menu I never had much issue with the staff like other reviewers have mentioned but I also haven t been in there for a while If their lunch prices were a little less I would give them 5 stars The dinner prices are 12 18 but seem fair for what you get 
lqsFvSbUqVPiN2BAdwZ9Dg CMU This place is amazing I ve only been their twice since each meal costs half a months rent It s totally worth it though Also the waiters are great with the wine parings I ve had some of the best wine experiences of my life here 
LSSuZmP_uA44s2WUTc2F9g CMU Went for lunch last week maybe the chef has changed since the soft opening as I found nothing overwhelming about the menu and would agree with one reviewer who described it as expensive and limited I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was described as coming with mixed greens since I d rather have that than sweet potato chips and there was no salad when I got my sandwich When I asked the waitress she said my salad was on my sandwich which did have a piece of lettuce on the bottom Besides that my sandwich was very dry and tasteless My lunch mate wanted a cup of chili and was told emphatically they only had bowls but when it arrived it was the smallest cup of chili I have seen and for 7 The cornbread was bigger than the cup Another person in the party had the burger The 12 burger When it arrived it looked like a slider I do think he said it was good but there are far better burger for a better price than 12 Our bill for lunch for 4 was 70 Way too expensive for lunch Even a NYC lunch but the food was not worth it at all On the way out a couple diners seated next to us said they couldn t wait to get on their Facebook accounts to let people know how bad this place is And we agree I give this place 6 months Save your money and go to destihl or any other burger joint for better food 
lt6VQWKkWfj7JE1EdeGVOw CMU I don t see what all the fuss is about I lived in Chicago for many years so maybe I m spoiled I don t mind paying 27 for a steak but the steak I had was average at best and one of my friends had a rabbit dish that was just okay Third friend had a seafood risotto that was the best of the three entrees The entree selections were very limited and tried too hard to be different or unusual Waiter was nice but new I would guess because he seemed nervous Not rushing back any time soon 
Lx76Vx5HG1AXnT5hi3IRbA CMU This was on graduation weekend and mother s day so I am cutting them a little slack since they were busy We were able to get reservations for my wife s mom and decided it would be a great idea to take her out on mother s day When we first got there it was pretty packed it took five minutes before anyone at the counter acknowledge us They sat us down in a booth and an older waitress asked what we would like to drink we ordered three cocktails and she asked us if we were in a hurry No we are not but thanks for asking The drinks took ten minutes to come out apparently we should have said we were in a hurry For the starters I got the Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio for myself and Shrimp Cocktail for my wife and her mom both came out fast and were decent taste wise overall The waitress to me seemed a little spacy and not quite there we had numerous other waiters waitresses stop by in between for refills and checking up on us since she wasn t For entrees we all ordered the Cider Brined Double Cut Pork Chops wait times were roughly 25 30mins We were anxious to eat it as they were very thick chops until my wife cut her pork chop open The center of it was medium rare borderline rare Mine was a tad undercooked and also her moms the waitress even commented and took it all back They recooked it correctly and ten minutes later we received it back the meal was above average and we enjoyed it Now I normally would let this slip but the manager proceeded to stop by our table and explain that is how they cook them at Silvercreek and well sorry I guess the waitress isn t aware of this because she was the one to first point it out If this is the case it should be stated on the menu totally unacceptable and unprofessional behavior as it wasn t really a legitimate apology The manager there needs etiquette training you do not act snooty like that to customers The desert we decided on was Caramel creme burlee and I have to say it was perfect It made up a little bit for the disappointing experience but hardly a reason to return only for that Overall my experience was mostly negative with the service and how things operate there they try to come off as upper scale but it falls flat The location they are located it is a little bizarre as right next door you have some sort of vehicle repair shop and things look a bit run down For what we paid around 150ish and we did tip More then we should have we did not get our moneys worth I can t recommend Silvercreek for the service location and price You will find better places to eat in the area 
LxmAs9yrNqiOav4Wlu_F-g CMU Food is ok not a big fan but I know my friends like it a ton Grilled cheese is pretty decent 
m17R6nYAQg_dENDL9wE43Q CMU The Bread Company is a restaurant with many different faces By day they have a varieties of soups and sandwiches as well as baked goods Sandwiches are on luscious slices of thick bread and the soups come with crunchy salads I especially like the grilled sandwiches which are laced with creamy butter and lightly browned meat Portions are quite large and one sandwich could probably be shared easily among two adults Sometimes I forget this and end up making two meals out of one sandwich During lunch hours this place is quite crowded but by late afternoon it becomes serene Soft green light floods in from the skylight and during the winter you can sit the fire with a baguette and a glass of wine As regards to the review that mentioned rudeness about adding protein to things I ve heard that happen many times during lunch and now they let you have your meat but charge a lot for it They have this bizarre policy because they don t want people making their own sandwiches with the bread that comes with the entree Nice one At night it becomes more formal with candlelight fondue and more upscale entrees The balsamic potatoes that come with the entrees are perfect I like the fondue but it s a little too much for me even the small pot can be shared by two Last time I was there I tried the tapas and the yellowfin tuna and the lamb were delicious but I was less than enthusiastic about the duck mousse which had a bland sickly sweet flavor The greens that came with the tapas were also pretty inexcusable When I go to a good restaurant I expect more than just some shredded romaine especially when field greens are still in season The new small desserts are also not so great The chocolate mousse was good but the bread pudding was just some bread soaked in eggs and sugar 
m1No68agZoXec-DfLXswtQ CMU Tried Big Grove Tavern last night for the first time two around fifty year old couples We wanted to sit outside lovely evening but BGT has very few tables outside I guess they must not have bought Jim Gould s furniture because JG had a large area of outside dining So they put two tables together for us but didn t have enough chairs so they brought one out from inside it wasn t the correct height so made for awkward sitting I read about the popcorn they bring out as free munchies Last night s was rosemary I was worried because that can be a really strong spice but it was good couldn t really taste the rosemary It was funny though BGT serves it in tiny pails which the waitress kept replacing over and over as there wasn t much in each tiny pail Might as well go to bigger buckets and save yourself some effort I would describe the menu as eclectic pricey and limited For people with big budgets high end taste I guess it will work But for middle class Americans like myself I don t know how people can afford it go there very many times per year Our bill for two entrees one side two iced teas no dessert appetizer salad soup alcohol was close to 50 with tip We were just wanting to have a decent dinner before a movie and not go to a chain restaurant On the positive side the food was very good My husband had the free range roasted chicken and I had the mac and cheese w an asparagus side Very well made very high quality But you knew there d be a but my husband s chicken dish was described on the menu as free range roasted chicken w herb dumplings asparagus mushrooms fingerling potatoes roast chicken jus For 18 there was ONE fingerling potato cut in half ONE asparagus cut in half and three dumplings He was still hungry after he ate it Since this restaurant does not offer bread cornbread is available for purchase of course there was nothing else to fill up on Had we ordered salads our bill would have approached 75 for a mid week meal My mac cheese and asparagus were also very good excellently prepared asparagus grilled just right and sprinkled w I believe sea salt and pepper But I was trying not to spend too much if I had ordered a salad and some cornbread my bill alone would have been close to 25 BGT and Bacaro and Carmon s Bistro with all three you receive so little food for the price you pay I want to love them all because the quality of the food is sooooo good but we just can t afford it The biggest faux pas of the evening though which I was surprised to not see mentioned in the other reviews of BGT on this site was pitchin for the kitchen Has anyone else ever heard of this We have not and we eat out a lot here and in other cities Not only was pitchin for the kitchen mentioned at the bottom of the menu but our waitress had to point it out to us as well What So awkward One of our companion diners said it put a sour note on the dining experience for her It came off as the restaurant doesn t pay its kitchen staff enough that they ask for tips We are already paying the current 20 for wait staff tip and now kitchen staff is going to ask too Un freaking believable I doubt we ll be back any time soon Silvercreek is just as good and you can enjoy their homemade bread free And also actually be full when you finish dinner 
m4ke1JxaO-uR0qorv-U_Qw CMU We went with our kids which may not have been the best idea since they are young However the waitstaff and food were phenomeal so we were able to enjoy a great meal as a family 
m4WfhOns3GGjrXU8pPNT3Q CMU Ordered the Steak sandwich medium The waitress brought out a big chuck of meat sandwiched between a french roll When I bit into my sandwich it was bloody red Nowhere near medium On top of that it was smothered with caramelized onions which were very strong and took away from the taste of the steak The service was average Nothing great Overall I would never consider going back I can find a better steak sandwich for a lot less at a number of different area restaurants Coincidentally I spoke to a friend about my experience weeks later when Destihl came up in conversation only to find out that she had the exact situation happen to her when she visited Destihl Her steak sandwich was extremely undercooked as well Must be a common trend with this place Just another common chain restaurant as far as I m concerned 
MB_nbd6qgtpMJYsSO9gCVg CMU I have gone multiple times and my parents pretty much live here The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable on what they have and they are super friendly I love trying new things and I am never disappointed My dad has helped them with a batch of beer they have made Reese s vodka just for my mom and honestly whenever I go with them to eat it s like I walk onto the set of Cheers Everybody knows their name But you don t have to be a regular to feel like you re getting special treatment I love that they bring you samples of their beer or tell you what just became available after aging I love the location I love the feel I just wish I had more money so I could visit them more often 
Mdhftu6QMajN634_xxl0_g CMU I want to give them 4 stars but their menu needs some work They have put a great deal of thought into the atmosphere and aesthetic of the restaurant but not enough into what the customer wants to eat I have visited three times and each time I go I come away a little more disappointed The unique menu loses its appeal when the food is more satisfying to look at on the plate than it is to taste The ice cream sandwich dessert was perhaps the toughest dessert I have ever ordered at any restaurant Their one vegetarian friendly option was mac and cheese which gets tiresome to vegetarians With the volume of alternative diets being practiced especially in a college town I assumed a trendy place like this one would cater more to the non traditional eater Their new twists on traditional food abandons the American fare loving customer as well as the non traditionalists 
mdYf2sdLlQFcv3Ys49oYSQ CMU The menu was confusing but overall the food was excellent My only complaint with Bacaro is the service Our waitress was attentive but a complete airhead She couldn t effectively answer questions and constantly interrupted conversation by rearranging items on the table 
mE2bZyYkH6x75AsgZZtu2g CMU You won t go wrong with anything on the menu All of the food here is incredible Things you can t miss Beer Battered Asparagus Flat Iron Steak Quesadilla with Blue Cheese Mediterranean Pizza and Stuffed Poblano Pepper Leave room for the S mores 
mG5mC0pmDpsEdhqkzt0BSw CMU The Bread Company is one of my favorite restaurants and is one of the things I miss most about U of I I ate here frequently as a student and as an alumna I make sure to stop in every time I return to campus The atmosphere of the restaurant makes me feel like I m taken away from the stress of every day life They have a fireplace in the corner and white lights strung up to make it feel romantic but it is modernized with the art that they have on the walls My husband and I usually share an order of cheese fondue and a gourmet pizza The Bread Company offers a nice selection of wine and beer including wine by the carafe I can t forget to mention their selection of fresh baked cookies The sables and chocolate macaroons are delicious Great atmosphere delicious food and reasonable prices I love this place 
MJC2wZpFSdHePXefmrIrFA CMU Best campus bar Food can actually be quite good especially the Kobe burger The crispy but greasy fries have slowly grown on me The beer selection is way better than any other bar on campus They now have some Rogue ales which are fantastic Bar is homely but at least it doesn t have a disease festering feel like certain other campus bars Becomes increasingly less acceptable during weekends to the point where it actually is unsanitary and you can t hear anyone talking over the noise The Jukebox churns out more and more horrifying music as people become intoxicated If you go here stick with weekdays On weekdays it s actually a pretty nice place to hang out with friends 
mrouhzpE2qN67x0UF6DOeg CMU I ve been Houlihans several times and I am definitely a fan While the service has definitely been dopey at times our food has always been very good The apps entre s and even the salads have all been great I really recommend giving this place more than one chance to shine The only downfall I feel this place has is the prices but it s in a hotel when s the last time you got anything for a normal price in a hotel It s like buying hot tamales at the theater 
mruDmy3QqQn1tDVSjnRgkg CMU I LOVE this place My boyfriend and I used to go there on dates when we went to school there and we d order the cheese fondue and a bottle of wine It s a great date place and the ambiance is better than many places in the Champaign Urbana area Plus the prices are very reasonable I ll be going back whenever we re down there 
MsQ1AJHRhcGBiTFHvkvbPA CMU My family and I absolutely LOVE Destihl It has become the go to place whenever my parents visit I am in law school The first time we went there I was pleasantly surprised to see how many options were available for myself because I am an ovo lacto vegetarian Usually I have to settle for something bland or uninteresting but Destihl has lots of imaginative and delicious options We started with the beer battered asparagus which was pretty tasty I ordered the stuffed pablano which was absolutely amazing It was spicy and had a really interesting mix of flavors My mom got the Thai fried chicken and my dad got the ribeye which they both loved My boyfriend got the bison burger which he thought was good but not as amazing as our dishes The second time we went was for lunch I got the lunch combo with the portabella and brie sandwich and the beer and cheddar soup The sandwich was yummy but the soup was really very delicious Definitely comfort food and really hit the spot My mom got the Thai fried chicken again and my dad got the Thai steak which he said was even better than the ribeye My boyfriend ordered the Dijon chicken which he really enjoyed You should probably make a reservation for dinner but likely do not need one for lunch They also serve brunch on the weekends until 2 00 and those items looked pretty delicious as well We have had great servers at Destihl and the restaurant has a nice ambiance Plus they don t have a corkage fee The first time we went we brought our own bottle of wine and there was no charge All in all we have had really great meals here and will definitely be returning 
musQ-SYx_IgNwSTHsiGh5A CMU Great new option in downtown Champaign Everything about this place has a light touch both casual and selective The welcome snack is a daily fresh made popcorn with a rotating seasoning Ours was crazy good but we had to ask the server to place the flavor cumin orange zest Apparently the chef regularly changes it The tap and bottle list is craft beer lover s friend Not trying to outdo a number of taps contest but all the right choices were there Especially loved the slightly sarcastic These Beers bottom of section of the menu for those who want a Bud Light instead Tater tots are like nothing you ve seen homemade and tasty with an apple sauce The smoked bacon practically jumped off the deviled eggs The menu feels relatively small when you re used to the pages and pages on your typical chain And I wouldn t mind if they expanded it a bit but there were so many good looking items I think it will take several visits without any boredom That most of the ingredients are locally bought makes it worth it Service was exactly what you expect from a place like this a whole step above any chain restaurant Constant attention knowledgeable about the food funny and warm but never over intrusive Perfect Nice job Big Grove Tavern We ll be back 
mZwjTUIEgqyniX1Wc904Gw CMU I know the whole local concept is hip right now but Big Grove does it right Plus the interior is cool with open space and interesting visual detail the branches on the ceiling And our waiter was on his game with recommendations and satisfying our motley crew s numerous requests Our group started with deviled eggs all around I tried to take a couple bites but dang it was good I would have ordered another but our food came pretty quickly after Deviled egg doggy bag anyone or just me I had the turkey sandwich which had so much flavor for a turkey sandwich Loved the bread the cheese the spreads Also ordered at our table was the Tavern Burger which looked like a big juicy meatball and the chicken sandwich Their menu looks different now which means rotating sandwich toppings and mains never gets boring Their salads bar snacks and starters all look amazing this time around too I plan to make this a regular lunch spot when I m in the area Maybe dinner too so I can try one of their fun sounding cocktails 
n132VXAD7lTJs_KSDDlf4w CMU Perfect for a burger fry and beer You can t go wrong Fries are great 
N1lqCk8s38mcJ6i3QRVz_A CMU The best bar on campus Hands down Their food is always tempting typical pub food but I usually come for the the beer and friends The location is great and the atmosphere is better than the other campus bars My one complaint is that they lack the depth and sophistication of the selections at other bars downtown I don t mind my Blue Moon but somedays I want something a little more interesting than the usual suspects If you are going to be around for awhile learn about when the specials occur Mug nights half off bacon cheeseburgers etc If you want to carry a casual meeting this is a good location for lunch The late afternoon and evening hours will be a little louder 
N3hynUKUQDjPiKnjS_J8tQ CMU On Wednesday July 11th a group of seven of us went for dinner After a week of oppressive heat we were happy to be able to enjoy the weather and sit outside It was great We started with the tater tots and deviled eggs for appetizers I loved the tater tots They re not your typical frozen tots They had some kind of apple puree sauce on the plate Initially I was skeptical potato and apple together It was delicious though Holy cow I really enjoyed that I wish more than 4 came in an order though The deviled eggs were nice also I really got a lot of the sweet pea flavor It sounds odd but it was great and added a freshness to the egg For dinner several of us got the burger Ohhhh my gosh It was great Cooked to the perfect temperature It was a combo of bison pork and beef The red onion marmalade on top was awesome It added a sweetness and a lot of great flavor A couple other people had the fried egg on top and they enjoyed it The bun wasn t store bought and tasted homemade very similar to what my husband bakes It was nice to have a bun that doesn t disintegrate The hand cut fries that came with the burger were the best fries I have had in years Another friend INHALED the white fish I didn t taste it but he said it was great Someone else got the pork belly and kohlrabi gratin She said it was great and was really happy with her choice I wish I hadn t been at the opposite end of the table so I could have stolen a bite It looked good For a cocktail I had the Tavern Infusion It was great and refreshing There was a good selection of beer and wine too I stuck with one cocktail and water though It was a nice touch when the owner came around to the tables and said hi and checked on us and other tables She seemed really nice Everyone at our table enjoyed the meal We will definitely be back again hopefully sooner than later 
N7MCq5pIbEtkWSSo9HCgLw CMU This is a simple and straight forward Mongolian barbecue And yes I really did Meh experienced better Same food same greasy plate and same mish mash of flavors How can you improve on a simple Mongolian barbecue Better ingredients better service and accommodate what the customer asks for especially when you are charging a premium for the same simple easy to make dish food A simple request like dont mix the egg in the rice but fry it separately like a simple omelette should be honored Instead we simply got what he decided to make and no explanation on what happened to our request Whats the point of having a additional requests space if you dont honor them when asked about it we got a oh we forgot about it and no offer to make a replacement The overall experience was as any other Mongolian bbq place be it in a mall or a food court only at a much higher price So what can draw a customer to this restaurant food if you havent experienced mongolian bbq its worth a visit service meh nothing to brag about overall worth a visit once in a while maybe for lunch 
n7PzDTnaz5ddBoaMyzgt5A CMU I ve been on campus since 2006 and Murphy s has yet to let me down From drink specials 2 Woodchucks on Thursdays I m in to great food I m looking at you Irish Nachos to the atmosphere you can count me in as a fan The expansion has made it much easier to walk around the bar on the weekend nights when everyone is cramming in Finding seating is less of a rat race but I d still say to arrive earlyish if you don t want to be standing The bathrooms can get a little sketchy but I pretty much expect that from a campus bar The jukebox has some interesting selections and the music is usually good overall It s my current favorite place to go and hang out with friends while not spending loads of money at the same time 
N8X6HcYs6o5d2DcGIwT8iw CMU Big fan of this place They ve expanded since I went to school here which is fantastic since the overall feel is less crowded The more people you can fit in the bar the shorter the line outside I haven t had food here in years but I know it s super cheap Drinks are cheap too decent draft beer selection for a campus bar and it s surprisingly not that hard to snag a table there are a whole bunch of them I ve had many an evening here dancing in that space in front of the jukeboxes And you should know that this is not a place where a lot of people dance it s mostly just people drinking probably shaking their heads and laughing at my friends and I dancing around like idiots to Bon Jovi But you know Murphy s just makes me feel comfortable enough to do that The jukebox blows on busy nights though even if you pay extra for play next like 10 other people already did that so you might not hear your songs at all And you ll probably have to sit through a lot of stupid crap that other people picked out before you get to any good music I guess it just depends on the crowd Either way we always stop at Murphy s when we come back to Champaign and I know we always will 
n8Z_oncr3kSljKFSIEzukg CMU Bevier Cafe made me so happy the day a friend introduced me to it that I returned two days later They publish the menu for the current week and the next week online and I m now addicted to looking at it every day If you look at the menu you ll see that they have a steady rotation of specials and also a list of standards Their entrees are pretty universally 4 50 and sides like peas with fennel and bacon are as little as 50 I highly recommend visiting on a day they re serving black bean burgers which are not just frozen Bocas but large well seasoned and freshly made really 4 50 Yesterday I had the portobello tacos also 4 50 My lunching companions have variously tried the soups sandwiches and pasta dishes all to acclaim The desserts look delicious though I haven t tried any of them and the fountain soda is reasonably priced and refillable The service is also very quick you order at the counter where you pick up a tray flatware etc they give you a number you pay and then you sit down and they bring you your food before you know it I am told that they sometimes run out of popular entrees but I ve always gone around noon and I haven t been disappointed Bevier is a student run venture within the College of Agricultural Consumer and Environmental Sciences at UIUC though they do have an actual chef bio on their website The decidedly weird thing about Bevier is that it s on the second floor of a building on campus so going to lunch is sort of like going to a lecture hall until you arrive at the actual cafe where things start to make sense again 
nD85FPGY2dGl08jV01xZ0A CMU Very good bar and an institution at the U of I They ve expanded so now there s more room to groove Great tasting burgers A bit on the small side but if you get them as a special it s worth it 
NeZGn5FH-mbLV8jgwFcxeQ CMU Another fun new restaurant we tried in Champaign My daughter who lives there is moving to Spain so we are letting her choose whenever we go down for football games and she has been picking some winners This is a sleek clean modern space There are beer vats as you enter which add a nice vibe of authenticity We were seated right away at a very comfortable table for the four of us We tried the deviled eggs app and some gingery egg rolls we all split them and liked them Both had a bit of a kick the egg roll sauce had the most kick and I found this out after I had drizzled it all over mine but I still enjoyed it immensely I just drank some extra water Everyone tried a cup of soup because hey soup is good food I gobbled up every bit of my beer cheese soup so light and flavorful I loved it With my swordfish tacos I had an amazing iced tea it was just a lovely flavorful tea with an orange slice The swordfish tacos were divine but if you are a bit of a spice wimp like me you might want the guac on the side that is where the heat was for sure I ended up just eating the fish out of the taco it was just too picante for me I adored the rice bean corn side dish Just delicious For dessert we all split a sour cherry bread pudding and I really liked it It came with ice cream and it was just smooth sweet and a bit of tangy with that nice cold creamy spot of the ice cream I am not a huge bread pudding fan but I think I could become one This was a very enjoyable meal The team had played lousy my daughter is moving I needed a culinary hug and this was it I would definitely come back but sadly it won t be with my youngest Why don t you meet us so I won t miss her 
nH0Zw8DuqO0lc_eymIqvUg CMU The minimal bare acceptable campus bar for graduate student inhabitation But only on weeknights When there are no sporting events And your car has run out of gas and can t get you out of campustown And you really need a drink because your advisor just called you to tell you you have to cancel your weekend plans to come over and shovel his sidewalk The leftover vomit is less tangible the smoky haze less all engulfing and the number of 14 year olds skanks less overwhelming than anywhere else on campus except firehaus but apparently no one goes to firehaus despite the fact that it is clean devoid of skanks and conveniently located 
nh_w2-44yiLupECYLEWIVQ CMU Slow service weak food im not sure the beers we ordered had any alcohol in them they tasted watered down The place looks promising but I was dissapointed 
nJA0WWXFUD2E11dsz6nsCg CMU In a word dissapointed I thought it would be much better The bread was boring my 25 00 Filet had no flavor My mashed potatos and zuchini were good My server did not want to be there There were flies and the grass outside needed mowing and the trash picked up I had a view of Reds Muffler Shop 
nKTRLCDGRVevxpM0bIxYBA CMU Bread Company is across the street from my office on campus and while I used to pick up a sandwich combo for lunch I ve since given up because the combo is so uneven And now with the combo prices hiked up higher than ever 10 for a half sandwich and cup of Campbell s soup I probably won t be back for lunch either The grilled cheese sandwich is substantial and generally yummy though hot sandwiches are served during a very small time frame but the salads and soups are serviceable to dire I m never very excited to eat their salads which consist of slightly wilting greens but the soups taste like they came from an industrial sized Campbell s soup can Murky chicken noodle broth and sparse chicken and noodle No thanks At lunch with a friend her very basic soup held vegetables suspiciously similar to that recognizably uniform shape and size of the bagged frozen sort It definitely does not seem as if the soups are freshly made at all The lunch hasn t ever made me want to come to dinner for fear of similarly cut corners 
nqw0Qb1LurnIYP0ypVn8Vg CMU I was only there once waiting for the bus after the Home Show at Assembly Hall I was there after lunch hour but before dinner on a Saturday so things were very quiet Sat at the bar was almost alone The Fish Tacos were the best I ve had inland I ll go back just for them The prices were a bit high like many in hotel places I guess they assume everyone is on an expense account 
nVFVv-UZT7kxY5lsmxyrFQ CMU Ok seriously this place serves some of the best tasting Guiness on tap that I ve had thus far And this coming from a beer lover who hits irish bars in Chicago It s really fresh My college buddies and I returned to this old college hotspot to reminisce on old times We used to come for Mug Night on Wednesdays so this place brings back great memories It s been 8 years since I ve been here so I was really surprised when the food and beer was actually better than I remembered First of all I already mentioned their beer on tap it s quality and fresh and low cost Secondly their burgers still rock in an awesome way I had their Turkey burger while my friends had the regular cheeseburgers Man oh man these burgers are juicy and seculent The turkey burger is well flavored and succulent We basically scarfed down our meals including the yummy fries Another good thing is that they also expanded this place it used to be way too crowded but they added a whole other section to this place They have a nice layout with table sizes that comfortably accomodate anywhere from 4 to parties in the teens I love their spacious bench seat tables If you re visiting U of I definitely hit up this place It s a cherished favorite 
nxauxpIV3Y6HuwZXjplxuw CMU We don t usually go to newly opened restaurants until they ve been open for a month but so glad we went The food was delicious Service was amazing Ambiance delightful Had a little of everything deviled egg fries chili with corn bread mac and cheese mac and cheese is a little pricey sorry but Boltinis mac and cheese has you beat on this one and of course dessert rhubarb crunch and sweet potato waffles the sea salted ice cream YUM Of course beer and a Glider before and during dinner Great job We will definitely be back and feel that this will go on our favorites list Another great downtown Champaign restaurant bar 
NzaJeZR5zcPhBcvEAgKeoA CMU Not only is the food amazing but the service splendid The server was knowledgeable and able to recommend items She could talk the talk I m not going to embarrass myself with trying to revisit the foods and their special ingredients but it was all delicious We had oysters sea bass pumpkin cake and pressed coffee with Frangelico We also had a wonderful bottle of wine The view from our table of two looked out over a busy and entertaining Walnut Street This is now our new favorite restaurant It was also very easy to make a reservation on the iPhone We had set out that night to go to Biaggi s I m glad that they were too busy to take our reservation for two That led us to Yelp to find another white table cloth Italian style restaurant Anybody can do Biaggi s Bacaro s really stands out 
OC16FeVOplR_HTejU9hTjg CMU Not bad not great I ve had the pot roast sandwich and the bison burger The pot roast was a surprisingly small portion The bun on my bison burger was a little stale Honestly my biggest pet peeve with Destihl is their attempt at trying to create elevated food that just come off as tacky For instance when I split their quesadilla appetizer they proudly touted it was deconstructed That meant the appetizer consisted of some tortillas with melted cheese and a side of so so grilled steak Give me a break I ve had some cleverly deconstructed items before and that was not the case here They do a similar thing with smores e g the marshmallows come pre melted Tacky might be a strong word but to serve things in ways that are poorly executed and actually make eating your meal less enjoyable and more complicated in an attempt to seem high end is pretty tacky 
oDDj969Ju12RKMcmiWwoxg CMU The place looks great and I love the beer The food looks great but it doesnt taste great it s usually overly salted like calm down with the salt shaker I like that they offer 2 mini beers so that you can try multiple That s a okay in my book one last thing what s up with the waiters ALL of them They ve all got the personalities of awkward engineers I actually was so certain our waiter was an awkward engineer that I asked him if he was a student at U of I Imagine my surprise when he said he studied library sciences WAAAAH Anyways moderate place for food good place for beer awkward but polite service 
OdsU-wOLtV62MSqAngtEOw CMU Destihl was something that was completely unexpected for me to find in downtown Champaign It was a MUCH bigger place than I anticipated and I would love to see it on a day when it was busy We were there about 3pm on a Monday I was immediately impressed with the vibe of the place very hip and something you would expect to find in any major city s downtown The beer list was posted on a board above the bar and was HUGE for a local microbrewery Where I expected to find 8 10 local beers supported by a smattering of other regional brews the list of beers brewed in house was closer to 20 25 As I had never been to Destihl I asked the bartender to select 4 beers for me to sample this is typical practice for me a good bartender will ask the right questions and figure out what you like He started by asking if I wanted darker or lighter beer and then asked me about some different flavor profiles After a few questions he came back with four delicious beers I tried the Roadblock British Red Ale Black Angel Stout Deadhead Double Red and Antiquity Rye Wine All were really awesome I was very pleased with the bartenders knowledge of the beer the fast friendly service and the atmosphere in general Next time I m in town this is DEFINITELY a place I plan to return and hopefully next time I ll get to order some food as well 
og3dbdTctfvOHhR0gt4Vvw CMU Murphy s has the best atmosphere patrons employees food beer selection space price drink specials and Mortal Kombat II on campus If we haven t already met then I m sure we will at Murphy s Definitely as good as it gets on campus 
oGUIHYMyV0uI8iNzdJIYaw CMU I have NEVER ever had a bad dish here The service was always so spot on but then again that might just be because they know me I am always impressed with the ideas Thad s crew thinks of and I am such a fan of ANYTHING the dessert Chef Allison makes that girl is incredible Sure it is pricey but it is mostly local products which makes me more than happy to fork over more They seem to be particular to detail which is a plus to me The wine is top notch too Honestly anyone who finds Bacaro pretentious must be insecure or needs to be more social Good Lord fine dining people You pay for what you get ALSO Thad has also mentioned to me how he likes his business to have less seating so its about quality and not quantity RESPECT that I think I need to save to go there again so worth it 
oI3qkCroP_Y1VLu4SUPrSQ CMU Expensive food but quite delicious and well presented Portions are a bit small but if you re going with appetizers and dessert the amount of food will leave you full and happy without being too stuffed to leave your chair The waitress made a great wine selection to go with our food The restaurant isn t very big the decor is modern A good place to go on a date if you re willing to spend the 
oIHaaWRCEi-m8_7qpZ1ZyA CMU Murphy s burger and fries A classic You can go for all your fancy burgers custom cooking whatever it is But I will always reminisce about the burgers at Murphy s It s no longer the tiny dive bar it was when I was in college but it still has a very relaxed feel Feel free to carve into the old wooden tables everyone over the past 15 years has 
OMdsM0azXE-hIT4uO5ztlA CMU Foodie euphoria You can presume the food is going to be incredible when they offer a sous vide entree on the menu I actually altered my business travel plans to come to Destihl based on Yelp reviews and am super glad I did I drove through Illinois on a day trip and passed the Destihl sister location in Normal early in the morning before they had opened so I decided to stay overnight in Champaign to visit the other Destihl location I ordered the Red Chili Pork entree and it was quite simply remarkable note I posted a tryptich Instagram photo of my dining experience here on Yelp I also sampled several of their beer offerings conveniently and affordably sold in 4 oz taster glasses All were more than satisfactory as compared to other microbreweries of which I have been to many The interior is also pleasant being situated in a newly constructed building There is outdoor seating which was in high demand on the warm early evening I was here in late June As one who travels a lot for work I can strongly recommend this restaurant 
or6IeWvsVYxk-p-sZyNLoA CMU Great Irish Pub right in the heart of campus This bar is almost always packed especially if there is a good game on The food is awesome too for bar food They have a great chicken sandwich with french fries Add a tastey Guiness to complete your meal 
OSE1B3Qby2Sm695yJCQs9A CMU I ate dinner at The Bread Company for the first time last night prior to attending a play at the Krannert Center I had read many reviews of the restaurant and entered with some trepidation My party had a reservation for ten people at 6 00pm and I was in the last group to arrive a little late The other guests were already enjoying a drink while waiting The service and food were both outstanding Our server Nick was prompt polite and knowledgeable Everyone s food looked so good I ordered a vegan pasta dish with vegetables which was excellent My wife had one of the unique pizzas and enjoyed it thoroughly I noticed that at the end of dinner all in our party had left nothing on their plates We were all full happy campers Only one member ordered dessert chocolate mousse He said it was great We were finished with a leisurely dinner and had our bill paid with more than enough time to stroll down the block to see our play The only negatives were bread that was a bit burnt due to what appeared to be a hot spot in the oven and the meals which were delivered to the table one or two at a time which seemed a bit odd However the overall experience was enjoyed by everyone making for an excellent prelude to the play I will definitely come here again 
OsFPGPrKQSkVSxIKTYWbvA CMU Out of the bars on campus I d have to say Murphy s is higher up on the list as they re a good place to stop by day or night During the day you can come here and they have these kickass big savory juicy burgers a different burger and fries special each day that are really yummy and filling so if you haven t already try making it out here at least once for lunch You go in and order at the bar and then walk to the back where they prepare your order to pick it up There s usually no cover here at night with the exception of special occasions such as Unofficial Mom s Dad s weekend etc and have good knowledgeable bartenders There s a wide selection of beers over 25 I believe and they make a kickass Amaretto Sour my fav next to Irish Car Bombs btw so you should buy me one if you see me out at the bars ever __ they re like a Starburst in a glass Like all the other bars this place gets quite crowded on weekends and as everyone else here has commented on the jukebox is loud and at 1 a song gets heavy use abuse Some of the stuff that comes out of that thing I don t know man P The specials here are also pretty sweet yay for logo glass night Overall it s just a great campus bar to frequent anytime 
oVGWp4BbD3gdecpk0GYf0g CMU Just writing an update since it s been 1 5 years since my last review of Bacaro I ll keep this short and sweet Bacaro is still deserving of 6 stars Mmmm 
pAPVXcKWXpfvju9egrxW-Q CMU This place is horrible The food is raunchy it comes out cold and the Restaurant was so cold inside I wore a winter jacket in the summer Avoid this place unless you are almost starving 
PeLOJZ7CMHoiY_O7Nij54g CMU I had and still have high hopes for the bread company I loooooooooove bakeries Love Bread happy I lived in Germany for a while so european style bakeries are even more happy The first time I came to TBC it was around 11am on a Tuesday and I wanted a quiet place to study I wanted to get a small zupfe roll because they were fresh out of the oven and a cup of coffee but that didn t cost 5 and I didn t have any cash there is a 5 card minimum I wound up getting an americano a whole zupfe loaf and a cookie The zupfe was delicious Hot from the oven braided yeasty and slightly sweet I pulled it apart and ate 1 3 of it right there The cookie was pretty greasy The americano was fine The second time I came it was after a big exam and I wanted a glass of wine At 11 30am TBC was happy to oblige My two friends ordered the portabella sandwich which I had a bite of and I have to say it was delicious Marinated chopped portabella mushrooms melted cheese some kind of sweet fruit spread I wish I d ordered it I had a glass of riesling which was fairly expensive for the quality and a bowl of chicken noodle soup I was hoping for a nice homemade soup with fat noodles and pieces of chicken but what I got was a crock of bright yellow soup that I know came from a Mrs Grass box I will continue to come and try more of TBC s offerings but definitely not the soups 
PERVkCeYC8U6PeyELQpn5w CMU Murphy s is the dive bar that we all kind of grew up on Sitting right in the middle of campustown it s a hard place to miss whether it s the big on wood exterior the fantastically long lines to get in every Thurs Fri Sat night or the plentiful logo mugs the average Illini will obtain it s just the place to be Few places outside of college campuses will you find 1 pints or 3 you call its 4 pitchers Much lower key than Legends Murphy s has the unique feel of being open to anyone willing to take a step out of their dorm rooms You can t call your bar hop night a barcrawl if you don t stop here The food is good the drinks cheap and the people are always merry in Murphy s I will miss every night I ve remembered or forgotten here 
pJ7a1DqW_efiRQWJdqKPGQ CMU Visited once Personally I thought it was overpriced for the quality and quantity of food received and the service was lackluster at best Five of us went after work for drinks we didn t expect to have dinner but we were all a little hungry so decided to get a light fare before some went out to a party later that evening I don t drink alcohol so I ordered lemonade 2 50 and it was just ok not very tangy and a cup of their potato soup and house salad with blue cheese each 3 95 I can t believe they don t have light French dressing this is criminal I was disappointed that the server couldn t keep the salad orders straight unfortunately two of us ordered salads with white dressings her s ranch mine blue cheese since there was no French dressing The other gal had to serve as taste tester to determine which salad had ranch and which had blue cheese dressing For 11 26 plus my decent tip since I m not usually bitchy unless the service is really really bad I don t think I will likely return to Houlihans on my own free will If however someone really wanted to meet me there I might go for the company and stop at McD s on my way home 
pLCEqT9DByPJnvTxk4A0-w CMU I went their for a weekend lunch and was disappointed in the selections available For lunch entrees there were only sandwiches and I was really trying to avoid bread I got a turkey one anyway and the amount of bread was huge The amount of turkey was small They served a huge amount of sweet potato chips with it The sandwich was good but not worth it s 11 price tag The service was really slow we waited 20 minutes for a check and finally had to ask the host for help The best thing about the lunch was the mini popcorn appetizer 
pljED5ZCtW_YTwFeALJCCQ CMU It s a treat Great prices and value Convenient location on campus The food is tasty and I love supporting the University of Illinois Food Science students 
PQeAQlJKYyd7jAhUB0dlAA CMU If you were to add up the amount of time I spent at Murphy s in college it would probably be close to the total time I spent in class Even today this haunt is still our campus favorite when down in CU for a football basketball hockey game Back in my day they didn t have the new addition but having the additional space makes it much easier to get a table and some space to move around without affecting the divey campus bar feel Wednesday is Logo Glass Night and I have several boxes of the great glasses I accumulated over the years Their beers on tap is great especially for a campus bar The food is pretty good pub grub but I believe there is a game day menu where only certain things are served which is kind of a bummer if you want Irish nachos on game day because it s not on the menu The jukebox is great every fricking song by The Black Keys can be found on there and there are loads of flat screens to catch whatever game is on If you get there early you won t even have to pay a cover 
pqFU0nt4EFC7lpIvwfcpLw CMU WOW I am really surprised by all of the good reviews of this place I have been here twice both times for lunch The first time I went with colleagues and two of us ordered soup It came out cold and had to be sent back We ordered the cheese curds to share nothing great and I had the Chimi Chicken Torta which was actually pretty bland The second time I went I ordered the Tomato and Bread salad with chicken By the name of the salad you would think it would have tomatoes on it right I had two little pieces of a tomato wilted greens and a couple little tiny balls of mozzarella Not acceptable I asked the waitress for more tomatoes and mozzarella and after looking annoyed she returned with more of each I don t know what others are having that s so great but I am very unimpressed with this place and will not be returning 
PqT0OU__3ZPFfuaJo8dQHA CMU I have dined at Big Grove twice now My first experience was good but my second experience was not so great I went there for dinner on a Saturday night and order the chili and the whitefish Both were very tasty and had that been my only experience with Big Grove I would probably have given it a four or five star rating Unfortunately I went there for lunch and had the chicken salad sandwich I wish I had read the other reviews about it before I ordered The chicken salad was absolutely flavorless and there wasn t much of it The bread was dry and tasteless Moreover the dish cost 9 00 I hope the owners are reading these reviews because the chicken salad sandwich is consistently getting bad reviews and needs to be revamped or taken off the menu altogether 
pTLRzRDsKnJZdZcnQoxc3w CMU I ve never visited Murphy s during prime douche time so its rating remains high I hope to never see it while extremely busy because I m 99 sure I d hate it I first went here the day after moving into town I was undernourished and exhausted Plus we had to buy lunch for our two moving helpers So imagine my elation upon arriving and finding that I could get a bacon cheeseburger and fries for 5 We bought four big ass lunches for 20 And it was actually good So satisfying was my first encounter with Murphy s During the summer they have a great drink special every day You buy a mug filled with beer for 4 or 6 damn all that beer wiped my memory clean and then get refills of Bells Oberon Sam Adams and a few others for 2 all night Now that is a sexy drink special The ladies bathroom has graffiti on the ceiling that says something about being in love with LBJ Lyndon B WAS a pretty man I guess 
pwIAZ0iNcyJnDrxSU2Fxgw CMU I love this place I ve gone to U of I for four years now and regularly frequent this place The sandwiches are always made fresh with great ingredients I highly recommend it As for dinner it s a little overpriced but the bakery lunch menu is the best you can find in the city 
q1VQgZjg-Iir24OXY65qBQ CMU When I first lived here the Bread Company was a sandwich shop along the lines of our local Blue Baker here in College Station In my absence it has morphed into a sort of European style cafe that comes very very close to pulling off the ambiance and level of attention such institutions tend to do The breads are great esp the Swiss style breads I believe an actual Swiss family owns and runs the place Wine list is good but sloppily organized That said some serious gems on this menu and the prices are shockingly almost retail We had the chef pair an extraordinary Spanish wine with our dinner the other night Food was excellent a nice cheese and charcuterie plate began our dinner well above anything among the high end restaurants where I live The lamb medallions I had were cooked perfectly medium rare and the mixed green salad was fresh and perfect Miss this place 
q8bGJu_GERu4vLNfXVKlvg CMU Irish Nachos Nuff said 
q9CnVPfmRU1tZccfTIDSvQ CMU I have been here for a Soft Opening dinner and their first official lunch I was not disappointed by either For dinner we tried 4 of the 6 starters and all I have to say is that the hash browns were excellent and I could probably eat the pickled veggies every day and never tire of them The Pate is a must try and the deviled eggs are just perfect We tried 4 of the soups salads and while I was not a fan of the seared pork belly others at the table thought it was very good but the cheesy grits on the bottom were amazing The cornbread was delightful almost as good as Black Dog and the chili just right I look forward to trying the other items The entrees were a great size and very well done I had the pan seared fish which was perfectly cooked and had a side of pickled veggies The cornbread stuffing on another plate was so good The chicken was very tasty The steak was cooked to a great temp We also had the mac and cheese they seem to understand that people like cheese and bacon because this dish did not disappoint I plan on going for dinner many times For lunch we were disappointed that the burger had already run out but we will have to go back earlier to try it The steak sandwich was very good but the star on that plate was the Sweet Potato Chips they were absolutely delicious The horseshoe was very good and I especially enjoyed the sauce I will be heading over there again for lunch very soon This place is a great addition to downtown Champaign and a great replacement to Jim Gould s The decor is very well suited to the atmosphere the place is trying to convey I love that they expanded the bar The prices are a bit high compared to some of the other places downtown but the food is of such a great quality that it is well worth the price My biggest disappointment is that I am always too full to try the desserts because they look very good 
qagxxEM9cYnySVeeRXE2Iw CMU As far as campus bars go this is as good as it gets A great place to gather with a small group of friends and drink some beer 
QC95iOMe-pFUdB_M1d5pZQ CMU If it s raining and you re on campus Bread Co is the best place ever o eat a pretentious sandwich while watching the precipitation assault the pavement from the safety of your cozy table The sandwiches are top notch and filling I ve had the turkey pesto and the portobello Both are delicious Double frosted brownies make you hate your lack of will power but are suitably delicious as well Service is a bit aloof but reliable Like all other elitist jerks out there look for me savoring my expensive sandwich while reading a pretentious theorist I ve got street cred to maintain 
QGMgiZ7zjWVpzQJD3xS6Yw CMU What a neat little place Amazing ambience Of course the place will really light up on a game day They have got a good menu A good selection of small plates 2 4 of these would be one meal with very reasonable prices A traditional selection of regular appetizers The drink selection is great They have pretty much everything on the menu but I dont know if they really have it behind the bar The happy hours are very attractive Not as much as other places but still great We went for a dinner one evening We were served by an apprentice waiter She did a good job and the person over seeing her was very courteous and respectful too They offered to correct our drink when we were not satisfied with the one we got The beer selection is satisfying The small plates are delicious and will leave you wanting more But thats what they are designed to be Delicious small portions The sliders are tasty The chicken is moist and tender Great going so far The entrees are a hit or miss I particularly did not like my Salmon It was tough chewy and smelled a little I do no like seafood when it smells of seafood Yeah fresh seafood does not smell at all and feels tender yet firm when you cut it chew This one was definitely a miss The grilled shrimp entree was good The shrimp did not suffer the same fate as the salmon Save room for desserts for sure Good selection of individual desserts priced reasonably Highly recommended for happy hours small plates appetizers desserts bar menu Inconsistent about entrees Looking forward to try their brunch Watch out for the happy hour listed on the site is no longer valid They have a different happy hour configuration now 
qKy5kVCP8txZ7dUKbMW63A CMU Aw Murphys this was the first place I went to when I turned 19 and could get into the bars Love this place totally low key bar where you just sit have a few beers and talk with friends Older crowd here too compared to like Kams or Clybourne is that still there They also have a juke box I don t know how many times we loaded Madonna songs On my 21st bday we stayed til close and they said on the PA it s closing time but we ll let the jukebox keep playing because it s not Madonna Food is pretty good too we d go when the bacon cheeseburgers were on special OMG so yummy and incredibly greasy They also have loaded waffle fries that are awesome 
qlguy_kdwTyg8wqERxtyIQ CMU FINALLY We were all being teased for so long about when it would actually open I went it s opening weekend and let me be clear when I say this rating is based on beers alone I didn t get a chance to try the food yet I ll start by saying that the atmosphere is really cool It reminds me of a Blind Pig Brewery meets Seven Saints or something like that They call themselves a gastro brewery instead of a gastro pub which I think fits the bill pretty well The place is divided up nicely with the bar being it s own area and a nicer looking restaurant on the other side I have to say though I was a bit surprised to hear that it s only open until 11 that doesn t seem wise for an area of town that s so reliant on the nightlife As far as the beer goes they had 18 on tap that were freshly made on the spot and they were pretty amazing I was surprised to hear that they didn t have anything but their own brews available and I worried about how my non fancy beer fans felt but then when I tasted their Champaign Blonde Ale it was EXACTLY like a Bud Light I think my favorite that I sampled was the Downstate Pale Ale and the Raspberry Wheat Ale was a bit too much for me But overall I think they covered their bases pretty well I definitely can t wait to come back and try the food which I hear is truuuuly delicious and give this place it s 5th and final star UPDATE So I went back and finally got to try the food I believe I ordered the Swordfish my boyfriend got the jambalaya and we both split some of the beer battered asparagus I ll say right away the asparagus was the best part which didn t surprise me because everyone raved about their appetizers but I never heard much about the main dishes My swordfish wasn t that great to be honest and I m pretty easy to please My boyfriend s jambalaya wasn t superb either but then again that s probably not the best thing to order at a place like this All in all everything was good and a nice change from what s available downtown but if I had one piece of advice it would be stick to the beer and small plates 
QLVlORmLkpSai3x7hSrzYA CMU Fondue dinner at the Bread Company is probably the top restaurant experience I miss from Urbana IL caveat this review is a bit out of date At the time you could get a very decent swiss cheese fondue with good bread some roasted garlic for an appetizer and two glasses of house red for just over 30 a princely sum for a starving college student but compared with the trendy 100 fondue restaurants in the SF Bay Area a steal The dinnertime atmosphere was also great quiet romantic dimly but warmly lit They also had fantastic checkerboard shortbread cookies I ve been hard pressed to find better anywhere else Lunch sandwiches and other baked goods were both decent but the five stars are for the fondue date memories 
qnAwJzvof5lyyp_gjLKpIA CMU Deep fried bacon is awesome Great selection of beers Service good Waiter waaay too social Buffalo was yummy Nice ambiance Ample parking Reasonable prices 
Qq0jlwliL8EoID_WU13bpQ CMU Silvercreek is one of my favorite places to go when I m in the mood to be pampered with great service and excellent food The restaurant s ambience is just about perfect with romantic lighting and a beautiful garden room that s just breathtaking more on that in a minute There are some complaints on here about the food but I think it s delicious I haven t had anything here I didn t like One of my favorites is a salad whose name escapes me at the moment made with field greens goat cheese toasted walnuts dried cherries and a champagne vinaigrette dressing It s simply divine I could be happy with just that However it just keeps getting better I think the chefs are pretty creative although the menu hasn t changed much in the three years I ve lived here The desserts are excellent as is the wine selection I ve heard that brunch is fabulous but we ve only been for lunch once and dinner a handful of times They put on quite a show for New Year s Eve with a special menu and a generally festive atmosphere It was New Year s Eve 2004 that my sweetie and I were sitting in that gorgeous garden room enjoying a night out on the town when all of a sudden a diamond ring was staring me in the face and my sweetie was down on one knee asking me to marry him Now Silvercreek isn t directly responsible for one of the happiest nights of my life but they certainly helped make it as perfect as it was and for that I thank them 
Qq_x-vLRyWgE2gxaKM8B3A CMU I ve been here a couple of times with a group of people at an off time The experiences I ve had were fine The service was good food is decent a little bit more than what I would like to spend for the amount that I get but is a solid change to add in your repertoire of restaurants for lunch 
Qwnhv_RFtbut0nWfrXAowA CMU A bar I spend a lot of time at There is a great selection of beers with 25 on draft plus a selection of bottles There are the normal ones but then more interesting drafts such as Bells Warsteiner Spaten Summit etc The burgers are great but the fries vary in quality when they re good they re really good but othertimes not so much There is soup and chili in the winter and the Irish Nachos are a U of I staple Usually is busy Wednesday thru Saturday with Thursday being the best specials 2 Import drafts and bottles 2 Bacardi Singles 4 Jim Svedka Doubles 6 75 Killians Honey Brown pitchers If you want a table on those nights you need to get their early Sometimes the jukebox leads to very questionable music 
qZNpjQhB5-bQ3mi1uFCKGg CMU Bacaro pronounced bah kah roh is a trendy little ultra modern wine bar The food is largely excellent though portions are modest Bartenders and waiters are generally quite knowledgable about the huge selection of wines they have which is a great plus And prices are rather reasonable though not great Perching yourself at the bar for half off wine and some dessert on Sunday night is a great way to enjoy the ambiance of this hip little place 
qzOvw7x7Bkc7wT7HCoSG6g CMU I actually think this place is decent for a nicer version of TGI Friday Service was good Food was nicely decorated and tasted good I got the filet mignon which was good but it wasn t worth 22 bucks my friends on the other hand got fish tacos and they all liked it 10 we got Bruschetta for appetizer which was really good Ambiance was cool Decent albeit expensive drink menu I mean it s a fine dining version of TGI what did you expect Overall I enjoyed my visit there I would go back there again 
q_WAdo6B4bEpOBeUl_9Vkg CMU This place is pretty bad The decor looks like the contractor went to Lowe s or Home Depot and bought all the fancy materials from the discontinued materials section and just a note here to the management really bathroom stall doors that go all the way to the floor Western civilization pivots on the ability to look down and see if there are feet under the door and thus realize that you have to wait a minute instead of jiggling the door handle like some pee filled serial killer The service was equally uninspired my least favorite combination of ingratiatingly peppy and incompetent and the food was mediocre when it got there It took so long to appear at the table that I was sort of hoping that the cook had sent out for it from another restaurant but no such luck And I only thought this might be the case because the menu says that the kitchen likes to get food from local sources This might be technically true they might like it but there s not much evidence that they actually do it I think I can honestly say that the last time I experienced this kind of ambience I was in an airport restaurant 
r17sYNWSU_f52Rc9q-FemQ CMU Not too crowded at 12am on a weekend Found a table whew and the waiter was very helpful He knew quite a bit about drinks their beers and the menu He was attentive and answered all our questions patiently Patience is a virtue to a bar customer because time is money for them and I get that The only thing I remember ordering was the deep fried bacon MMMMMMMM It had a bit of spice to it and they were great just taxing on the tummy 30 minutes after eating it Sooooo much grease but aren t things better that way Lots of interesting menu choices and in house brewed beers which I didn t have Hope you try them 
r8Q1HksYiRQrxNpBIT8a7g CMU This is one of those places that if people want to go have dinner lunch there I will go with them but it is not a place I will suggest The food is good but its mainly create your own stir fry so if it is not good then you didn t put the right food in your bowl The small plates are good but nothing is spectacular I find the prices to be decent for what you get The quality of the stir fry ingredients is very good and you can tell they keep an eye on it Good place if you like stir fry but definitely get the bread 
RAAksIod_Z724ThPxAyIMA CMU Excellent food nice atmosphere They seem to have upped their menu in the last year which is fine although makes for a higher bill at the end I m usually happy to bring the kids along the place has a very euro bistro feeling A minor gripe however is that the last few times we ve gone the service has been less than stellar It seems they like to hire hip girls who aren t so interested in helping a family have a nice meal 
rbK46lAe2o2thmUIJGAmUQ CMU Went here for lunch during the week while school was in session Busy but not overly so Seats were a little uncomfortable and not super baby friendly no room for strollers not sure they had highchairs Food was excellent and great portions Everything s a la carte so if you want something on the side make sure to ask buy it Great alternative to other sandwich options around campus and not too expensive Probably gets busiest around breaks in school day 
rDn7Up6ccN7eBSm2hB2iww CMU Thank god for this place That s really all I can say Well no I can say more But before I get to the meat of my review no pun intended let me say that Big Grove Tavern is exactly what this town needed When Jim Gould s closed I was sad to see it go but what has come in it s place is something really fantastic From the food to the interior to the crowd the energy Big Grove gives off is infectious and demonstrates that the confluence of intellect and small town charm in Champaign can really lead to something amazing Now on to the food Popcorn Come for free as a starter While I was hoping for bread I was even happier with this The popcorn really whets your appetite without being too filling I hear the flavor changes it was definitely some kind of lime think the hint of lime you find certain Mexican foods flavor when I was there Tavern Burger There are so many things I can say about the Tavern Burger First and most simply it s delicious The blend of bison was for me the most prominent of the three meats that make up the burger but overall I found it to be rich meaty and just the right amount of gamey given the bison The onion marmalade and petite crusty bun complimented the burger without overpowering the taste of the meat I opted to add the fried egg which led to messy experience given the soft yolk but a certainly more delicious one At this point if I did this right you are so convinced about the deliciousness of the burger you won t even care to hear about the fries But hey if you re still interested they re completely well executed crisp yet still potatoey Now onto my other comment on the Tavern Burger There was some review on here about how the burger is in limited quantities That s how you know it s fresh and locally sourced If I wanted something from a freezer I d head down by the mall and swallow some hormone laced bacon cheese blue cheese fried onion black forest ham ranch dressing heart attack in a bun If you want a burger that satisfies your burger craving while still being an appreciable entree and cut of meat come enjoy the Tavern Burger And if you ve missed it just come back and try again And frankly at 12 bucks it s not that bad The downtown Champaign restaurant scene generally errs on the more expensive side Given what Jim Gould s prices used to be like Big Grove is far more reasonable price wise in comparison In sum ignore the hate embrace the love Big Grove will have you leaving full happy and pleasantly surprised by what Champaign has to offer food wise 
rf7ZMrWVgRS6RT8taKrRpg CMU This was an unexpected fuel stop for a small group of us last weekend after discovering the long wait at the Courier Cafe just up the street The restaurant has a warm cozy feel to it equipped with a full fireplace and lodge esque interior The bread variety was quite delicious esp the olive and rye breads I ordered the jumbo shrimp appetizer the name escapes me which was incredibly spicy It was ok I also ordered the spinach salad which was quite good My fiancee ordered the pot roast entree which I sampled and it was actually very good My friend ordered the brie appetizer which was also quite tasty The only downside was the service which was slightly lacking The price is moderate but nothing completely unreasonable They also have a nice selection of domestic and import beverages which always makes me warm and fuzzy inside 
RfcsbpMXKJMprA0ZnwMt_g CMU It took about a year to finally eat dinner here though I would walk past it nearly everyday I ve been here many times since One of the best nicer places on campus Dinner menu includes salads soups pasta and pizzas It always seems like the sandwich grill shuts off right when I get there so after a couple attempts to order the sandwiches I stopped asking The bruschetta with goat cheese olive tomato basil and a light balsamic vinaigrette is delicious This topping is fresh and not muddled The bread which they bake themselves at this co does not get soggy which I like The pizza is my favorite Super thin with a delicious San Marzano tomato sauce Crust is crispy and cheese is not overwhelming I usually order the Roasted Garlic or the one with a mixed green salad with a very light lemony garlic vinaigrette on top It s delicious The salad is pretty huge and sits right on top of the pizza This is a fork and knife affair I ve tried a pasta dish once with fennel I don t remember the rest of the dish Personally I would skip the pasta but instead order the dishes involving a hot oven it is the Bread Company after all They usually have a special menu that changes on different occasions One time a friend and I shared a dish off this menu Fried goat cheese balls with sliced strawberries and special honey with crostini Amazing Sometimes there is live music piano or three piece jazz band Fireplace for the romantics Chairs are not the most comfortable but it s about the food 
rKU8P3DTlZQ2g1-tXWLXTQ CMU Okay first of all credit where credit is due There are some delicious appetizers on the menu and desserts are HUGE and great for splitting My husband and I have been here a few times and we both really like the potato croquettes mmm chimichurri and the marinated cucumber salad Both have a spicy bite definitely recommended The rest of the food is okay Pizzas are decent the salads seem to rely a lot on the dressings similarly so with the sandwiches Service is good and friendly although can come down a little on the overwhelmingly chatty side Still in a place as big as this one it s nice to not feel like you ve gotten lost or abandoned Unfortunately I can t recommend much else The design and marketing of Destihl gives off a very artisanal vibe particularly in their choice of craft beer but their beers are at best uneven and at worst anemic shadows of what they could be Most recently I was disappointed in the pumpkin porter which sounds like it should be layered and spicy and complex Mostly it was bitter and I could only taste the pumpkin if I really thought about it I ve felt similarly about all of their beers that I have tried although a few are okay the Hefeweizen the Tripel I want to be seduced by the delicious descriptions and oh they DO have a good writer but I just can t This place reads to me as a large chain that wants to be a small careful art and ingredient driven restaurant but it doesn t get there It s confusing 2 1 2 stars rounding down 
RmINZ2dL3nEZ1RlkIbtaHg CMU This place is one of the nicer places to go for a fancy meal The decor is quite nice the service can be a hit or miss I would NOT go for their Sunday brunch I think it s kind of expensive and they pretty serve the leftovers from Saturday night I really like their steaks Those are pretty good Nothing else really stood out in my mind I think I would rather go to Timpone s see my review and pay the same price The only thing you just don t get is the as nice decor 
RN_ZVRjMs0Su2uOIwjevvg CMU Boyfriend and I went here for a date night We enjoyed our time together the food and the music selection The atmosphere is sort of country southern french meets Italian restaurant dining We ordered the bruschetta a pizza and the filet mignon Everything was very good and flavorful I especially loved the filet mignon the seasoning was so delicious and the meat was tender and cooked pefectly Overall nice ambiance and good service Food was delicious but a little overpriced 
rVfahvlKAgAdJl2FWaFGug CMU I loved the food and beer selection I only wish there were more vegetarian options It won t keep me from going back but I won t go as often as I might if there more veggie friendly choices 
rwjSdZFOnn9uccCgGVJ0hA CMU Probably the best place to eat in town now A quasi Portland style menu with some unexpected combinations Cocktail prices are the bomb Cocktails are not large but I m not complaining Very good deviled egg 
Rx3a1DU_vj654vS5fhawOw CMU I was extremely disappointed with Sunday brunch today Oh and by the way today was Easter for Orthodox people so I was hoping for this to be a special occasion While I don t think that 18 a person is too much for a nice brunch every once in awhile i do expect to get what I pay for I don t want to be ignored by the hostess then treated rudely by both her and the waitress Additionally I expect the food to be restocked If you own a restaurant and advertise that brunch is offered until 2 30 the brunch should be stocked until that time If you want to stop stocking the brunch at 1 00 the advertise that the brunch ends at 1 00 The good foods were omelets and waffles smoked salmon and shrimp the two things I could get cooked fresh and the two things that are served best cold Everything else was cold crusty crap We were rushed by the waitress who couldn t be bothered to refill our drinks Busboys were texting no one would check us out when it was time to pay In fact the only nice people there were the bartender and the omelet chef I liked this place in the past and if I have another chance to come back I will so I guess the have a chance to gain some stars 
S2gmW8hDnOcmy5NXnF2X0g CMU terrible service the brunch fondue looked intriguing so we asked the waiter about the serving size the menu claimed it d accomodate 2 people but we wanted to make sure the waiter said you can add some vegetables and it should be ok so we agreed to that he rarely came back out to help us the entire time then when we got the bill he charged us for 2 fondues i went in and disputed the charge and he finally credited us for one of them however after keeping track of the credit card statement it appears that he never refunded the fondues this is still in dispute and i want to make sure you no one makes the mistake of going here ps panera s food is better than this and i don t even like panera 
sJpBhm7cYi20pNn7hFy6cQ CMU Everyone says the Bread Company sucks but I don t agree The food is great it s just their prices that suck I paid 9 for lunch there the other day I d much rather have a 5 potbelly sandwich Dinner is good here but overpriced IMO 
SoAWaRQZBCh1T-oIeM8vMw CMU An unexpected pleasure just south of the UIUC main campus I agree with some others that this is an upscale version of TGIF Burgers were good price was fair food was prepared correctly and service was okay I never pin my hopes too high on anything in this town except for the outstanding academics but as stated my positive experience here is noteworthy
