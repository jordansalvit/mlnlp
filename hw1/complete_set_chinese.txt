-Ivw9EPwdASuO8Fq5k4MgQ CMU I think this place is pretty tasty And I ve never really noticed problems with service Maybe I m just not looking hard enough for all of these faults that everyone else finds here 
-J81R-4gwrLGp5eMzPldOw CMU On my way home from work I always walk by this place and I always see people walking into here So I decided to give it a shot and see what s up I m not a health freak or a food guru nor am I picky about food but this place is just plain bad The 5 meal is pretty decent until they charge you an extra 2 for lo mein instead of rice But the biggest thing that bothers me is the huge puddle of oil that the food sits in Again I m not a health freak but eatting this food just made me feel guilty With every bite I think about getting a heart attack at 27 There s as much oil as there sauce and you see the thick oil floating above don t expect a fantastic dining area either it s dark and feels icky I ve had my fair share of cheap chinese food and this is probably the worst I ve tried 
-JwFk3RhcJ3qxn4n-XpqWw CMU dear lulu what s happened to you you used to be the refuge for my asian food fix but your food leaves something to be desired lately dr fu s noodles has way too much salt noodle bowls are only ok you re a noodle place after all no excuses for being less than stellar the bibimbop looks like a medley of canned products and tastes like it i really want to like you you do have a great menu selection terrific drinks very cool vibe great location and efficient waitstaff but something in the kitchen really needs to change please please i hate to say but it s not me it s you 
-rMKUVJBGz2uL5LfiPPBXg CMU Chinese food for white people You can tell they have some skill in cooking and the ingredients tasted fresh but it s extremely Americanized Chinese food The flavors taste seriously wrong to a Chinese palate If you re white and prefer lighter less oily psuedo Chinese fare it s one of the better places I ve tried 3 stars because I m Chinese 
-taDjdmp94Tz-l9miE4z_Q CMU Finally a good Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh Even the decor and ambiance seems authentic with the family style tables paper tablecloths and slightly sticky seats The food is top notch we ordered from the Chinese menu rather than the American menu and were thrilled with our dishes I had shredded pork in garlic sauce and my husband had some sort of duck with Devil s Tongue yams Oh actually I suppose I did order from the American menu I got a cup of hot and sour soup and loved it Perfect for a cold night The waiter was terrific he gave our 6 month old a fortune cookie wrapped in crinkly plastic which kept her entertained for quite awhile By the time we left around 6 30 on a weeknight there was a decent crowd and all seemed to be enjoying themselves We re looking forward to going again 
027XE8NLsC_NyqAIHMhGfQ CMU I ve eaten at Lulu s Noodles two times now and have mixed feelings about the food The restaurant itself has a very casual and atmosphere during lunch you order at the counter as most of its patrons are Pitt Carnegie Mellon students The restaurant is clean and spacious and the service is wonderful As it is a pan Asian restaurant don t expect its food to very authentic to any particular region I was very surprised as what was passed off as pho the first time I ate there It was certainly not anything like what you would get at an actual Vietnamese restaurant the broth was bland and I think they used the wrong kind of noodles and it didn t come with lime lemon I should have known better I did however LOVE their pad thai which was also not very authentic no tamarind paste etc It was good though because I was craving a carb fest So all in all I d give it three stars they have their own interpretations of classic Asian dishes and whether their interpretations of them are good or not is a crap shoot 
0BQM7Q-uC8wSL9JC_ZkRzA CMU Cheap Get the teriyaki chicken on the lunch menu but get it spicy It s decent Like the new sushi bar Decent chinese if you re around CMU and need a cheap lunch 
0bsTBG5BaYtyVzkxB0RzuA CMU American Chinese food is greasy and terrible everywhere and that s what we know and love about it However Chopstix has accomplished the amazing feat of actually making greasy fried food taste bland One day I came home craving Chinese and serendipitously found one of their menus stuffed in my mailbox along with some absurdly good coupons I placed a huge order and paid almost nothing for it I guess I got what I paid for because the food was barely edible The Cold Sesame Noodles were just plain noodles no sauce and I don t think the Fried Rice was actually fried but it was inexplicably neon yellow in color I couldn t even find the chicken in my General Tso s it was mostly breading and a sweet and sour sauce I learned my lesson Trust me don t get sucked in by their prices just say NO to Chopstix 
0dJpD_47XNkUTPvTHASfJg CMU Very yummy I got to try a huge variety of dishes with a big group of friends who knew what they were ordering All dishes were great My favorites were Beef in Hot Broth Shredded Pork w Seasoned Tofu Braised Pork Shoulder Mao s Pork and Double Cooked Pork Belly Off the appetizers one of the Bean Jelly Noodles was delicious and Honey Pork Ribs were also great I know I just listed a ton of dishes because they were all awesome I m actually not great at handling spicy foods but everything was very flavorful with the right amount of spice for me and I didn t have too many problems afterwards Of course you might want to steer clear if you have acid reflux but they do have some good non spicy dishes available like the Braised Pork Shoulder Honey Pork Ribs Finally the prices may seem a little steep but they offer many dishes in two sizes The larger one is HUGE and the smaller portion is fairly regular sized The appetizers are pretty big as well They also put out a complimentary little plate of either fried wonton skins or Chinese style boiled peanuts for you to snack on before your meal Definitely recommend ordering family style and sharing dishes 
0kwMdCCTXxfo3COcZ9tzmA CMU This place is ok and i haven t been here more than once But i ve given three stars for this place because my friend always goes there and collects fortune cookies for me I collect the fortunes so most of my papers were from Orient Express So do go here to get fortune cookies I ts close to CMU and its very cheap It s a good place to go to when you are really hungry and you want to save some money Saving is good after all Smriti 
0MRevFr0LghQNKyJ3PvHHg CMU Their food is just okay I ve tried several of their dishes and only like one My friend and I tried their almond and taro milk tea and they were terrible I don t think they used tea to make the milk TEA They taste like they mixed the taro almond powder with water 
0N8aOTds6tQkAAJDBOlRvg CMU been back a few times for dinner and it s quite good their spicy beef tendon is great 
1EB9Bn22baBV2qLRmxhoCw CMU Lulu s is a mediocre restaurant and it offers Japanese Chinese Korean and other Pan Asian cuisines Go to this restaurant if you want to take chances Sometimes the food comes out alright but there are other times when the food tastes like complete crap It also depends by the hours the food comes out slowly and unsatisfactory during lunch and dinner times However the food comes out faster and OK at random hours The only dish that I recommend is Thai Lemon Basil Beef with noodles Lulu s also serves bubble teas and my favorite ones are lychee flavored tea and mango smoothie with bubbles Although the food is okay I m not satisfied with the service The waitresses at Lulu s can be rude sometimes 
1fQhAokBe-sW9RN0ZhbYPQ CMU First tried the place around 3 00 on a Sunday afternoon As we walked in a middle aged woman sat at a table next to the cash register She asked us Here or to go We said here She jerked her head to the left vaguely indicating the entire restaurant and said Sit down We wondered why she was so mad at us for coming into her restaurant We sat ordered and like we do at LuLu s got out or phones and magazines prepared to wait for a while The food came out almost immediately It was hot fast and absolutely delicious Steamed veggie dumplings were a bit bland but the dipping sauce was superb Mayalysian Satay Chicken was not a peanut sauce but a spicy red sauce Really good My Tofu Eggplant Fish Hot Pot a piping hot clay bowl filled with all of those things plus veggies was so good I didn t want it to end Luckily the portion was so huge I had enough for lunch the next day The Ginger Smoothie was made with real ginger so it had that fabulous bite Seriously good The next time we try this place we ll likely get take out since the service was so weird I won t go into boring details you ll see for yourself when you go there I m just saying the service is bad enough to make us not want to suffer through it again but not bad enough to cancel out the deliciousness of the food we definitely want to have again If the service had been friendly we d definitely have given this place 4 or 5 stars 
1hQFDM_BU1EpVoVCgvJ-Xw CMU I ve been coming here for over ten years Lulu s is Lulu s and it will never change but fortunately their Fried Tofu big plate hot and sour soup and crab rangoon have never changed and neither has my love of very unhealthy fried food if you come here for dinner the service is terrible but you ll get your food eventually if you come here for lunch your food will come out very quick and extremely hot and it may or may not arrive around the same time your dining companion s food arrives it s cheap it s greasy the spicy peanut noodle bowl is DELISH So is the fried tofu egg roll hot and sour soup crab rangoon curry and pad thai 
1s0NtLIsRrdMJLwFw-H6xQ CMU The chef here won t ever be in the running for a Michelin Star or a James Beard Award but Orient Express has some extremely reliable strengths 1 The service is FAST Not necessarily stellar or friendly but fast They take your order and bring the food out extremely quickly 2 The food is cheap It s hard to feel ripped off especially given the amazing convenience 3 The experience is consistent They ll get you to your meeting class nap on time and the food is reliably just below average But sometimes that s just what hits the spot especially when it fits the schedule and budget as well If you re looking for a date night place fine dining or something absolutely unique or delicious look elsewhere But Orient Express certainly has its advantages 
1ZitAVPeXrdNrKuQYdOTbg CMU I live off this stuff I m a strong advocate of fast and cheap service and even more so when their portions are huge You obviously can t expect iron chef quality food that you can eat for 2 meals for 5 so take it for what it is and enjoy it 
2Ct7BnpEpPUqsJj6J7mxUQ CMU For a quick decent Chinese place in Shadyside check out China Palace You get what you expect it s fast and not too expensive I ve only had delivery but when I want Chinese food I ve never had any surprises At the end of the day you get what you pay for As for delivery in they area it s decent enough 
2js1f4it7yZAZeGY2nhU9w CMU Typical americanized Asian food that serves three stars As a broke college student within walking distance of Lulu s I continue to go there due to convenience and the sheer fact that it is exponentially better than college campus food The problem I have with Lulu s is not the food itself it is to be expected with the prices but it is with the service There is a definite inconsistency with the service and at times my friends and I are left waiting for someone to take our order for 20 minutes despite letting the hostess know how long we have been waiting Or chasing down a waitress for more water I don t know if they treat us like this because we are college students but I feel that service is one of their biggest weakness So come here if you want large portions for a fair price and don t expect too good of service But as long as I go to Carnegie Mellon and I am broke I will still go here 
2Lx26zkmMtAiUU--h25Srw CMU I really feel bad about giving a one star review First it s not about the service price decor or the food I m writing this review after going there twice The first time my husband and I went the dinner was good We thought this place has the potential to be our go to Chinese restaurant in Pgh Today I remembered that they have an early bird special 3 6pm m sat The won ton soup was not authentic more like chicken noodle soup but wasn t bad The entree was fine What really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco cigarette smell from the tea I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum The smell wouldn t leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine 2 3 minutes then brush as long as I could to get rid of the smell Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray first visit 3 stars second visit 5 stars 2 stars 
2sMMj16R0mDYXZWn917KbA CMU Lulu s noodles is in an extremely convenient location for students coming from CMU so it should be no surprise that most weekdays around lunch time the place is packed The few times I have been there I have found the food to be okay nothing to write home about The Pho was utterly terrible and the various noodle dishes only passable The biggest problem though has been with the service You place your order at the counter and they are supposed to bring it to you Several times I ve found myself forgotten and having to go back to ask where my food is All in all it will do in a pinch if you re a CMU student otherwise steer clear 
2TpXJcqf7ngYTm0TBRGdmw CMU Service 2 5 stars out of 5 Food 2 5 stars Price 4 stars easily under 10 person Atmosphere 1 stars unless you like shouting and being cold A number of people have said that this a great place for college students to get decent cheap food I completely concur My low marks come from the fact that I don t want food that is just decent or cheap I want it to be tasty and I m willing to pay for that Also it felt like a college cafeteria the stereo was loudly playing poppy dance hip hop and rock songs So I m getting a whole bunch of pop lyrics layered with everyone around me shouting over the music I could barely hear my wife right across the table There seemed to be a cool breeze blowing across my legs from somewhere Perhaps it was from the 8 inch hole in the wall behind us The food was greasy yet satisfying The white rice was a bit chewier than I like it At least the tea was tasty and stayed nice and hot 
2yr_PT9p_M1pZZmupRLwQQ CMU I was expecting a lot more from JT but realized that it is a restaurant that serves both chinese and korean but not in a fusion type of way It merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu The idea was cute They even have typical chinese lunch specials The deco needs upgrading and dusting some lighting or even natural light its like walking in a cave and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air I had a craving for comfort food and ordered Jajangmyeon and grilled calamari The tea and water was served as I sat down I went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people The calamari came out promptly and the Jajangmyeon took a little longer The portions were huge What took the longest and annoyed me the most I was the only one left at the restaurant was waiting for the check Why does waiting for the check take 45 minutes They never came the clear the table or walked by so that I could signal that I needed the check I should have just walked out The food was okay but I seriously needed to get in and out of there in a certain time frame that they didn t help with You may want to consider going when you have a 2 hour lunch break 
3a4Arz49wCDwCSOf-Yz2Dw CMU Really great option for cantonese food in Oakland I ve never ordered from the buffet it doesn t look too good but they make an a ok congee no donuts unfortunately reasonably good roast duck pork and the fish maw soup is also very nice It s near my work and I like coming here for a late lunch when it s not crowded The interior is kind of beat drop ceiling battered furniture etc but I really like the laid back atmosphere This is my favorite place for a secret 90 minute leisurely lunch on a weekday with friends and sharing a few dishes Just arrive after 1pm 
3fvlOaVNHerW1qPJEs5QdA CMU What was supposed to be Pad Thai ended up being some bland noodles drowned in a big mess of bean sprouts and tofu and may be oyser sauce Fishy more chum than Pad Thai Chicken Noodle dish was mushy and reeked of rancidity and fish stock as well Food order came in after no more than 2 minutes of placing the order I really was wondering if he mixed our order with someone else s Anyway gave the usual tip because waitress was pleasent but not going back 
3n1FQU5hcie08KXyP7JHJA CMU Noodles Company is a chain restaurant yes but as far as I m concerned it s a welcome addition to the available array of Oakland eateries It s kind of like Chipotle for noodles you pick from a menu that has menu noodle dishes that fall into American Asian or Mediterranean categories I have tried a couple different things here and so far everything has been pretty good The Penne Rosa is definitely my favorite The only downside is that the restaurant is ALWAYS packed and pretty loud but things move quickly even so If you re in Oakland and feel like you ve tried everything around stop here You won t be sorry 
3NfxR-Gq4AmtYrpG2seE7g CMU Nom Nom Nom Nom This place is delightful As a hardcore Thai fan I frequently shun Chinese food Mostly because I feel the bland ameri chinese is greasy and unsatisfying This place however blew me away with their authentic Sichuan food Who knew Chinese food was this good Damn those restaurants that try to placate the American palate The millions of dried red chillies that were scattered through a pan of flaming fish calling to me with their flavorful spicy and tender meat that had layers and layers of flavor This place is just around the corner from us so we ll definitely be keeping it as a go to Tip You ll have to ask for the Sichuan menu they won t automatically give it to you Also the servers will give you plenty of tips on what is good and what are the most popular dishes that people order 
4IjMN_Nm0XdUC00EJnV-FQ CMU Super fast delivery Only Chinese place that offer wings fries combo Best french fries I ve ever had except at fast food places Update I don t know why I said the stuff above Their food sucks 
4Nq697uAroSSS8DiqC2ujA CMU This is totally subjective but this is my favourite restaurant and I miss it dearly I would only ever get a few things my favourite being Family Style Tofu It s so good Crispy delicious brown savoury sauce mushrooms and carrots and broccoli I usually ate it in two sittings I don t think I can find it where I live now and I only hope I can eventually come up with a recipe to what has become my favourite food So I ve gotten that and I like the Vietnamese Rice Noodle Soup The lemon cakes are also good and a good value I think And yeah the lunch specials are good too with the chicken on a stick If I ever get back to Pittsburgh this is the first place I m going 
4q3Jg4xE5cUYQC2DgdQ4Rw CMU We ordered take out from this place and the only plus was that it came pretty quickly Other qualities of the food included being too salty and too much sauce Pretty cheap too we ordered online and we were able to order something free for every 10 you order but this is not good enough for me to go back to this place again 
4qkTRXAX1lvFUiE8Hu3M8w CMU If you re looking for greasy Chinese delivery look no further Two pad thais and two egg rolls came to less than 20 The pad thais were huge and left more than enough for next day lunch leftovers The egg rolls were pretty greasy but hit the spot Not the greatest food I ve ever eaten but sometimes a girl just needs some really greasy noodles Delivery available through Meals Delivered and Campus Food Campus Food is cheaper 
4S-AhmrVwZ9DwXi6Pb6z8Q CMU Chopstix has a full menu of chinese and japanese goodies including sushi They also have really low prices Alas maybe it was too good to be true While my sweet and sour chicken was standard the sushi I ordered was quite awful It was not fresh by a long shot It was a good deal but the sushi was a major let down 
58x0GLPffLa3ou2dftQdwA CMU I ve had General Tso Mehh I ve experienced so much better 
5ezcgooLgD2f3KYQKuWHzg CMU It s O K and that s about it The service is usually slow and it takes a while for them to even notice you are there Don t expect to get your water refiled promptly either However my main issue is the food it just is never quite right I hardly am satisfied with what I order either it s too bland or too salty or just not right I live close by and have come here a fair amount of time in the past three years so I have given Lulu s a fair try It s alright just don t expect greatness 
5Lypz9M9i5y7Wh8X8Cz-kQ CMU I probably would have rated this higher had I not discovered Little Asia and Rose Tea cafe However since I have I would say this place is okay only The Chinese food is decent and it is probably better suited for big groups than Rose Tea or Little Asia However the food is not as good as Rose Tea or Little Asia either The food can run on the bland side I only remember really liking their Spinach Soup with Thousand year old eggs They are interesting enough to serve dim sum any time you want but I have definitely had better dim sum Then again I might be spoiled by the Bay Area dim sum scene D 
5rMkMGbsmUlsSvOW04BNfg CMU Lu Lu s has very affordable and very tasty food that always leaves me stuffed The service is good but parking is a pain A nice bonus is that nearly all entr es can be made vegetarian 
6BIZib0byI4VTpT7akGOTA CMU Had dinner here on Friday night and I m so happy I finally got to try this place At first I was a bit confused by the two menus but our waiter nicely explained how one listed their Chinese American dishes and the other authentic Chinese My husband ordered from the American and I decided to go with the Chinese Kung pao chicken The orange chicken was the best I have ever had The Kung Pao was pretty good too The ginger gives it a very unique taste but it was way to spicy for me Right away my whole face was flushed and my nose was runny Our waiter was so nice and attentive I really enjoyed my dinner and will definitely be going back 
6cxBqEeNpJ1kQjZyPI-QYQ CMU I ve eaten here twice The first time the food wasn t particularly good The second time the food was average but not particularly exceptional Lulus still gets three stars though because it s inexpensive and the bubble tea bubble smoothies are delicious 
6e0sxT0dg7KZ_wR3vpistA CMU I got the lunch special it was terrible Vegetables were inconstantly cooked and bland Meat seemed low quality Stick to the noodles 
6gbAlE8Jc2LriJsNShrgxw CMU Let me first start off by saying I m so elated I found this place If you ve seen my other reviews it can be most notably recognized that I don t have a deep affinity for Asian cuisine in Pittsburgh Actually that s being nice Asian food here pretty much sucks Meh That being said China Star might be my favorite option for Chinese food if I m clamoring for flavors that I m very much acquainted with Some of it is greasy but that s to be expected with ALL Chinese food good or bad I m ok with that It s the flavors and options that pulled me in and keep me coming back Went here with Jhon a couple of times now We ve tried everything from the tea smoked duck spinach and tofu soup the spicy beef noodle soup braised pork belly stir fried chinese broccoli spicy fish in the hot broth chinese water spinach spicy chicken in flaming pan spicy frog in flaming pan beef tendon wontons in hot oil etc Yes we like to eat Don t judge The tea smoked duck is a MUST The smoky flavors that they were able to infuse in the duck paired with it s naturally supple and fatty texture give way to a super juicy and flavorful meat It doesn t need anything standing alone as the star of the show The best part is the crispy skin Nothing is better than crispy skin esp on a duck or pig Mmmmm Other things I ve reeaally enjoyed are the spinach and tofu soup and the spicy frog in flaming pan The soup is very light brothy and comforting It doesn t bog you down but I found it to be quite refreshing and fresh I could imagine feeling loads better if I ate this while sick The spicy frog probably isn t for those who aren t so adventurous I personally love frog and have ordered every time I see it on a menu after extensively eating it in Vietnam The meat was succulent and flavorful bathed in a sauce with tons of dried red chilies like most spicy sichuan food onions garlic and bamboo shoots I seriously couldn t stop eating it I even ate the chilies and bamboo shoots SO GOOD Jhon particularly enjoys the duck like I do but he also loves the spicy beef noodle soup We re both suckers for noodles I seriously love noodles The noodle soup has great flavors has a good spicy kick the beef is super tender like it s been braised for a while The only real deterrent is that I find it greasy I know I said I don t mind greasiness with Chinese food as it s pretty much expected but the one exception in my mind is soup Who wants to slurp on oily soup Not this girl Kind of reminded me of food I had in China Still really great flavors Just don t drink all of the soup This is definitely on my list of favorite Pittsburgh restaurants to frequent 
6HPJDkpfNk9dh3-4U2587g CMU Looks a little shady on the outside but they re got plenty going for them on the inside They have the traditional chinese food menu but also an extensive sushi menu AND sunday dim sum that is so great A real treat to live so near to this place 
6IwOdbYoD5Lp55S3PmNx2g CMU Okay I ll toss this place one extra star I guess I shouldn t let one bad repeatedly bad though server kill the whole place s reputation The reason I gave in They use legit style Tofu Oh mercy me I m gettin the vapors just thinkin about it I have to give them credit for that Also the reasonably priced lunch special really saved the day on a hungover Saturday morning BUT let us not think the entire picture has changed I d like to dock them half a star if I could because they charged me 2 for an egg roll Insaaaaaane It wasn t even that good 
6QbtGvPc1Vhfaz33pZ8xrg CMU Mmmmmm great Chinese food here My dad and I came here for dinner last night after finding out that Jimmy Tsangs had closed Rick had to teach a night class and Mom had a meeting to go to Besides I hadn t been here since my last review Yeah I know the chow here is Americanized Chinese food Who cares it s great stuff Now when eating Chinese you should never begin by diving in to your main course right away First you ve gotta have some soup and some egg rolls Dad and I both began with some r e a l l y good hot n sour soup Man that was good n bold Warmed my insides right away Now I know that vegetable spring rolls are supposedly better for you Yeah right what s a great Chinese dinner without some good old fashioned egg rolls I like to put a spoonful each of sweet n sour sauce duck sauce and hot Chinese mustard on my plate dipping my egg roll in a different one with each bite I love the names of some of their specialties here including the Triple Crown Three Afire Sizzling Trio and the Royal Match Feeling a little adventurous and why not the old man was paying I went for the Jaded Affair Yum scallops and shrimp marinated in white sauce Usually seafood isn t my first choice My dad went for the Kung Pao Chicken I ve got to give him credit how a guy his age can eat that and not reach for the Mylanta is beyond me 
6qPpKJovxZB9m_0tfwnJww CMU I agree with l s I ve always enjoyed Lulu s It brings back happy memories of high school field trips and the freedom to walk the single block from the Carnegie Museum to grab lunch Their Thai iced tea and bubble teas are both good The spring rolls come with delicious sauce on the side and all of the vegetarian entrees are appealing The portions are huge and inexpensive and the location is convenient for students Med Center employees and those visiting the museum or the nationality rooms Sure it s not high class cuisine but for what it is it s good filling and affordable 
70gfcitEOyV8VU-I2-jGyA CMU I really do dig this place for its yummy food and its very close to my work so it is pretty convenient I usually end up getting the General Tso s Chicken possibly because I m white but also possibly because it is just that good I m starting to think there is something in the sauce I ve eaten a few other things that have all been good and the lunch menu is pretty extensive and inexpensive They keep the free tea coming and the service has always been good The only thing that turns me off a little to this place is the atmosphere it is a little bit run down in the entry way and the dining area I ll definitely be going back again maybe for some more General Tsos or maybe after reading these reviews for the salt and pepper squid 
7gkP8azqbtSmrx7TEi9-Ug CMU This place is probably one of the more authentic tasting Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh Don t order your typical american chinese dishes like General Tso or that sweet and sour bs That is not real chinese food Get the salted squid and stir fried chinese brocilli the razor clams the seafood soup etc I basically ask for whatever popular dishes the chinese customers eat Closest thing to china town food in Pittsburgh The places isn t the nicest place though But then again most places that are fancy do not have authentic chinese food lol 
7m5r48ktbb1kdyik0Ogzkg CMU Food When you re seated at Sichuan you re given two menus We weren t told the difference between them but after asking our waiter explained that one is American Chinese and the other is authentic Chinese This isn t written on either menu so if you want to know the difference ask Both menus are expansive and have similar items and we ordered exclusively from the authentic Chinese menu There are countless appetizers soups common and uncommon varieties of meats and seafood and vegetarian options We started with the Spring roll which was more like a vegetarian egg roll with a fried crispy shell It wasn t bad but very average although it did come with a lot sauce for dipping We also ordered the Sichuan pickled vegetables which didn t taste very pickled but were spicy and tasty The portion was large but they were extremely salty leaving us thirsty and needing water which became a problem see below We asked the waiter to recommend specific vegetarian items we ordered one of his recommendations and experimented with another His recommendation was the baby bok choy and black mushrooms which was exactly that with a subtle sauce and rice I asked for the meal to be made spicy it wasn t listed as spicy and the waiter offered mild medium or hot I chose medium and the dish was somewhat spicy but the sauce was fairly bland and a plate full of bok choy and mushrooms gets old fast We also ordered the Chinese eggplant and requested tofu to be added which carried an additional 3 charge The eggplant dish was considerably more tasty than the other but without the tofu it may have been similarly boring Nothing we ordered was bad but the best dish was only slightly above average The menu may be better suited to adventurous carnivores due to the plethora of options or someone craving authentic Chinese food Price The prices are very reasonable as our bill came to just over 30 for two appetizers and two entrees even with the 3 tofu tax Appetizers range from 5 10 with entrees ranging from 8 25 and averaging around 14 15 vegetarian entrees cheaper as always They offer discounts to Pitt and CMU students and a 5 discount to all customers that pay with cash Drinks Sichuan Gourmet does not have a bar and there was no mention of BYOB We didn t see anyone drinking alcohol Atmosphere The dining room is large with tables of all sizes and large windows facing Murray Ave The restaurant was packed while we were there on an early Friday evening and it gets relatively loud as the tables are close together They are open relatively late so if you leave the Squirrel Hill bars or the Manor before too late you ll be able to get some affordable Chinese food as a nightcap Service We were seated after a brief wait and our waiter provided menus and water immediately Unfortunately it was the final time we would receive water the entire dinner He never replaced the water without prompting and even after we asked multiple times we had empty cups and nothing to quench our thirst after eating salty spicy food The waiter answered our menu questions to some extent but the host waiter and another employee had a very difficult time understanding our English and we had trouble understanding them We waited 20 minutes yes 20 minutes after finishing our meal before the waiter came back to clear our table and deliver the check This may be an isolated incident or a problem due to new staff with the change from China Star but other tables seemed to be having a similar issue authentic Chinese food fair prices poor service average food Would I go back again Maybe once they work out the kinks and improve their service but only if someone could recommend a specific dish to try 
7olf6EsixpQ0pphx3VJsHw CMU Hmm Why do people eat here I guess they get their 1 star for convenience Other than that shrug Though I never had their bubble tea 
7U9DXif0c4auqGipwO-7Yw CMU Though I wouldn t normally give this place 4 stars I give it for 4 stars in relation to the other eateries right next to CMU Craig St Area The prices are good and they have a decent lunch special Their noodle dishes are all good like their loi mein Shanghai style if you prefer the thicker noodles and chow fan I think this place is by far better than Lulu s The service isn t friendly but it is competent and quick unlike Lulu s service which is neither friendly competent nor quick 
7yHIXNfHhnlRJ1GBa_P-rQ CMU Man how I love china star I misses my time in Pittsburghs sooooo much 
7zS_w2_QU8e9L_tAwwxtvA CMU People who reviewed this place as being GOOD obviously retain the taste buds of a snake fyi snakes have no taste buds Came here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in Wanted to go to Pamela s but the line was too long so we walked a few doors down to China Palace I was REALLY wary because I did a quick Yelp search before we walked in but my dad insisted that it was probably not that bad Here s what we ordered Cheese wontons Um they literally just fried american cheese in the wontons Who does that It s supposed to be CREAM CHEESE And they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in Chicken Lo Mein Beef Lo Mein Shrimp and Broccoli w Sweet and Sour Soup The soup was the most disgusting texture of I don t know what Needless to say that was left untouched Let s just say not only did it take 30 40 minutes to get our food for food that was of LESSER quality than Chinese takeout the food itself was just utterly disappointing A complete travesty to Chinese cuisine It was bland yet greasy and MSG ridden if that makes any sense Not only that they also didn t have BEEF CHOW FUN ok so whoever claims this restaurant serves authentic Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they re talking about And the kicker It came out to about 32 tip for food that we DIDN T even finish half of We literally just got up mid meal when we overheard the table behind us complaining about how they found a dead fruit fly in their bowl of rice DO NOT GO HERE unless you re a snake that is 
8Ax5v-LhfsIGkFz3Ser96g CMU Sunday lunch at Lulu s after working in Oakland for two years and eating there only during weekdays at lunch who knew that Lulu s actually has sit down service during the daytime I didn t that s for sure so I was surprised to see a bit of a line forming near the entrance at 1 30 on a Sunday No problem as we were seated within a few minutes of our arrival Now you don t go to Lulu s for good service You don t go to Lulu s for the dining experience that other restaurants offer You probably don t go expecting an authentic menu You go for tasty food served quickly and hot Spicy basil noodles with chicken on this visit hit the spot just as they have on every other visit I ve made In fact I love it so much that I hate to order anything else from the menu because I m afraid to miss out on the vermicelli noodles steaming with carrots snow peas red and green peppers etc The sauce is sweet and salty and could be spicier but I m afraid to doctor up the plate with the red pepper sauce they have on each table for fear of ruining the dish The crowd is nice on a Sunday relaxed but not lethargic Our server was polite took our orders quickly and stopped once during our meal to make sure everything was ok A word about takeout I ve only ordered it once from Lulu s and it was a remarkable disappointment The food took forever to come out 30 minutes or so and the balance of noodles to sauce to veggies and chicken was off because it was prepared in the to go container rather than on a plate I learned my lesson and now I ll only dine in 
8Dh6QgJ-Y9se0DSGg06xfg CMU Fresh it doesn t make me sick neat little place to visit for college students 
8dZD6CMnt57E_sYs1WB4ig CMU Express is a good way to describe this The speed of service here is sometimes a bit faster than McDonald s Chipotle etc If you are in the mood for something light I would highly recommend the Curry Scallion Pancake I thought they were really good value for money until recently when they increased their prices They have a lunch menu where they give you an entree an appetizer Vegetarian Spring Roll or Chicken Teriyaki and rice for 7 99 Although the quality of food is not that great I would go back there especially when I have a test the next day and need to spend every minute cramming 
8eE2fZ9DBlIWpYUOYGRn9w CMU I ve been here twice I can t say that there is anything particularly amazing that stands out about this place but I ve never been unhappy with it The food is good and it s pretty awesome they have fresh seafood Last time I took some sushi to go and watched him make it at the front counter A small part of me was super happy when I saw him wash his hands first I know that s pretty standard but you never know I like it I ll go back 
8jI5bXVvIdUjulIHz_dKpQ CMU Awesome shrimp pad Thai quick delivery 
8RhycudPT10cUGuy_nwQmA CMU What more can you ask It is at a convenient location within walking distance from college campuses It is cheap with large portions and fast service Americanized Chinese food but as a broke college student it is great for a college budget Not exceptional yet not poor Food is pretty comparable with Lulu s 
8StLyHKvrh6JyhIVbG0B1Q CMU I m lowering my rating The service is the absolute worst I dont think I will return anytime soon regardless of how good the mango smoothie is The food is average and the service is even worse but I still eat there though not regularly The reason for the 4 stars is the smoothies Try the mango You will go back just for that 
8WgST-aaWz0apI5EtmbAhg CMU Most of you guys know that I m a How Lee devotee but upon the insistence of Jarrett H I finally tried China Star now known as Sichuan Gourmet Jarrett thank you The food here is fresh and delicious and they use less oil than How Lee Now don t get me wrong I still heart How Lee but it s nice to be able to mix it up a little bit I ve had the frogs legs multiple noodle dishes all good I m not a fan of some offerings dumplings spring roll and crab rangoon and ordering over the phone can be exacerbating I ve also had to convince them that despite being white I m OK with bone in meat spice and weird meats Once convinced the employees seem to be genuinely enthusiastic that I m trying more traditional Chinese dishes Ethnic food places not believing me about spice level and meat choice is another topic and tangent I shall not engage here All in all though I m happy to have another delicious Chinese restaurant in my rotation and can t wait to actually dine in there rather than carryout or delivery 
8_wBAYEbLl_xf81APF54MA CMU 4 1 2 is what I should give Oh so spicy oh so good The mushroom flaming pan is probably one of the tastiest vegetarian dishes I ve had period The flaming pan dishes are good especially the fish the mushrooms in that oh so tasty Service can sometimes take some time but there are days when they are quick too I did a take out order yesterday and that probably took a total of 10 mins Tried duck tongue probably won t try it again Wasn t very fond of it Anyway the place is a must go especially if you enjoy mouth burning spicy food 
9cIXZBQkihi8L1naDag9tg CMU No matter it s pork beef or any other meat all share a same taste However fried rice and noodles are good Not very cheap compared with Szechuan fast food 
9pvzDgj-kxtXXAXUd3Yh7w CMU This was my first Chinese food experience here in Pitt and I ve gotta say guys I wasn t impressed This was also the first time in my life I ve ordered from a Chinese restaurant where the lady taking the orders and the delivery guy were white Odd I suppose then I shouldn t have been surprised by the food My Moo Shu Chicken was mostly cabbage The pork dumplings were all dough and the dough was very thick and unappealing To end on a good note though the hot and sour soup was both hot and sour which you don t always find 
9RNeCvAFjYUnLVRv41KZ3A CMU My husband and 2 yr old daughter went there for a lunch We arrived at noon and the place was complete empty but we witnessed a transformation as it got full by the time we left The staff was helpful and prompt to bring a straw for my daughter to have her water We shared a palace duck which consists n boneless strips of duck with stir fried veggies broccoli baby corn bamboo the usual covered with sauce It was not memorable but definitely heartwarming and a good choice for a quick Sunday family lunch We also had fried pork dumplings for appetizer and egg drop soup which were average The general Tso chicken we spotted on another table seemed to be a popular choice and looked tasty next time we will try that one for sure 
a5h0eBaTv1FThDxWKbkQfA CMU This is pretty average A couple of friends and I stopped by right around closing time and the nice hostess was really nice about taking us in which we appreciated Other than that nice gesture all I can say is that their food was average and merits a 3 star review From what I can see their service was comparable Pretty good portions for the price paid 
A6TQBg5uZRF0UJyQV5Q2AQ CMU Fast Food fast service great food and overall a great place to grab lunch or dinner You can sit down with a bunch of friends and you can also sit down with a small group It is not too far off of Carnegie Mellon Campus and is conveniently placed along Forbes ave 
ABr52fB9crI-_RdQng7ERQ CMU Great prices average to terrible food You get what you pay for Avoid the Pho it s not even close to real Pho 
AfJwNOsrmlDjilyctIIf2Q CMU I m spoiled I live in Asian Central of Northern California and can drive in any direction to find good Asian cuisine However as a Pittsburgh native I know Pittsburgh doesn t share the same luxury Lulu s actually has decent food I usually get the chicken chow fun which always pleases my taste buds when I m across the country from home and I m fiending for some Asian food I ve also tried the Pad Thai which is good as well Big portions cheap and pretty good However the service is nothing special you won t see waiters rushing over to fill your water cup 
AM_TdjSIKCcE25iaJt3oFw CMU This is a noodle bar place not a Chinese restaurant At times the kitchen can get backed up especially late at night Some of the staff does not speak English very well but I don t speak Chinese either so fair enough Meals are fresh cooked always hot and good Spice is adjusted for the american palette but ask and they will spice it up I am a regular fan of LuLu s Pan Fried Noodles with Pork hot oil on the side Egg roll and Hot n Sour Soup Friend really likes there seaweed salad Wife is a regular consumer of Crab Rangoon and Udon soup with fish balls pasty dough fish concoction At lunch order at the counter pay get a table and wait Evenings sit down with waitress can be very busy at times big student population Go and enjoy just have a leisurely visit with someone special Largest obstacle street parking is hard to find 
anAPQZK1Ty1HspMYqBVXGw CMU This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town Great location great veggie options Every meal I have eaten there has been tasty Only 2 things that bother me the hot and sour soup is TOO hot I can t eat it And it s not easy to find a parking space Lots of driving around to find a spot But the restaurant is definitely worth checking out 
Ao74tfvkcwh9oYvbZTyJGQ CMU Listen if you re going for the buffet you have to expect that its not going to be gourmet or always fresh out the wok The foods not always as hot as it probably should be its going to be a bit dry and the hot sour soup is on the salty side for me to admit that says something oh and there s no cream cheese wontons The buffets saving grace is the sesame tofu I like the fact that its completely self serve no waiting for refills If you re in a rush or trying to kill a hangover its not so bad otherwise there are other establishments you may want to check out 
apt0Vz8rFWh-qhBVOMQvMA CMU I was really happy to find a dim sum place but their food is just expensive and bad Their decor is just old and dirty Their food made my daughter so sick We only had dim sum that day so it must have been their food Why would anyone eat sushi in this place We did not order their sushi The place looks dirty how can their sushi be fresh and clean It s raw At least with Chinese food it s cooked Chinese people from the area is just happy to have some Chinese food They can do so much better 
asHvLSzbeH4O3C6kMRmiLA CMU Cheap Chinese food and a lot of it That s all people are really looking for when they come here The food is mostly meat in sauce over rice which is 5 50 special during the day They have more expensive dishes around 8 Boba here is horrid Never get it I couldn t finish half of it Service is impossibly fast They make it within minutes of you ordering The waiters and waitresses aren t particularly nice to you they have a bit of a dismissive bored attitude but they don t ignore you 
ATb56GMcnKDNw1aYkHozWw CMU Cheap Fast Chinese food Food isn t that great but the price over takes it I love going here for quick food It is a good complement for my busy schedule from CMU 
AVzMN4KRKtvjxF5oo3MLjQ CMU I got yelled by the lady when I called to let them know I didn t receive the dumplings which I ordered along with other dishes How dare they They have decent food but that doesn t matter to me anymore I am never going back to this place ever again HOW DARE YOU YELL AT THE CUSTOMER ABOUT YOUR FAULT 
Ax1owSKsoUtfepSrQR9GsQ CMU This is my roommate from China s favorite Chinese restaurant in Oakland He says they prepare the food like his mother did but he also mentioned that he doesn t think his mother s cooking is that good There is a rumor that Szechuan favors Asian students which seems to be true according to my roommate who was able to order meals after hours Based on my experiences the food quality and preparation time were on par with the other American style Chinese restaurants on the corner of Oakland Ave and Forbes Szechuan is a little cheaper but the entree typically consists of a little less meat 
aY1vE7uBimtPTflwEXfQvA CMU The food is good The prices are good The service usually leaves something to be desired that s why I usually order take out I love hot sour soup but for some reason they are usually out when I try to order it usually around 6p Bottom line you get what you pay for 
B39rIE3sPJOvO_njyKF0Iw CMU I found this restaurant by accident on Yelp and had to try it The food was delicious We got our food quickly and the service was great Their menu is very diverse and you can get actual Chinese courses if you prefer I would definitely recommend trying this place out 
B5hkQWimbaGgTYf12Kg9zw CMU Couldn t imagine asking more out of an outdoor food kiosk Good Pink Rose bubble tea and the Bourbon Chicken was surprisingly fresh I m used to Chinese chicken tasting so overcooked that it becomes a mushy rubber but this still was recognizable as chicken and was stringy when pulled apart 
b83smME36EwWBBIdrPhDNA CMU I happen to stumble upon Jimmy Tsang s while up in Pittsburgh visiting I must say the food is REALLY good The service was great but I only had a drink there with my boyfriend and we got take out We liked it so much we got take out for my family 2 nights later The woman that runs the front is very nice sociable and likes to talk about each dish She has great suggestions for your taste Her husband is the chef they are both from Korea and he has been cooking as head chef in restaurants for over 20 years If you like Chinese food you will love this place It also has two cool bars inside I highly recommend this place The reason why I give it 4 stars is because we got take out not sure how table service is but I m sure it would be good with the nice people working there A must try I bet it would be a cool first date kind of place 
B9qhGcNrsl81DarqYC2m_g CMU This place stays true to what its menu says small price you pay large portion you get It is by no means spectacular Chinese food but it s great for a quick meal The guy who works the cashier is very friendly the service is quick and the selection is enormous The General Tso s Chicken and Yang Chow Fried Rice are my favorite dishes 
Bb0T0CcXVbrwz6xOcBElxQ CMU My pad thai was very sweet and had no discernible spice at all The chicken seemed to be of low quality I also ordered a side of fried rice which was bland and unappealing Finally the mango smoothie which has been good in the past tasted like ice cream this time I have never enjoyed the food on previous visits but everyone raves about Lulu s so I keep trying to give it a chance I am consistently let down so I don t think I ll be visiting Lulu s ever again 
bBkIVdlcX8HdGoFk1ADILw CMU I ve had General Tso Wow I hated it 
bbY5epBFxN7S2TybS3sePA CMU Good Chinese delivery Nothing to die for but solid food at good prices I ve had the cold sesame noodles which were good though not spicy at all The hot and sour soup has nice tofu in it but could be hotter and sourer Pork fried rice is good though the rice is kind of a strange yellow orange color This will probably be my go to Chinese delivery in Squirrel Hill 
BCktVmBUKAtch39Bn6W0wg CMU I love Lulu s when I attended Pitt my friends and I would practically eat here every week While these dishes may not be the most authentic versions you ll ever eat some of their noodle ones are very tasty and plentiful I can typically get two meals and a small snack out of a single order I recommend the Pad Thai and Singapore Rice Noodle but my all time favorite is the Pan Fried Noodle with Chicken Yum 
BjdDuO6kJrSOFps7tQoFfg CMU I always get their yellow chicken curry rice bowl It s SO good and they give you a ton do there s always leftovers And their bubble tea is awesome Lulu s is definitely a place you ll want to go back to again and again 
bkch2_V1BmN1vLV-rpSUMg CMU Best Chinese restaurant before Chuan Ba Wang on forbes ave was open I don t know why American people like to eat American Chinese food If u like Chinese food u should go to the restaurant which provide real food not just cheese or something U will never find cheese in the real Chinese food So if u like cheese please go to wendy s to order a burger 
bn1eF5CoXRqKFtLU_eSldg CMU Not really a fan of this place the food is just average It s basically just very Americanized Asian food There is nothing bad about it it s just that there is nothing great about it either Pass on the thai tea here not that good I find the food to be a bit bland portions are very good everything is about 10 bucks and you will have enough to fill yourself and take a bit home for later Being close to CMU it is very convenient only reason I use to go 
bNtMyp7Z7TigzQyZr8O-qw CMU This place is great if you want Asian food that is good and consistent I always get the szechuan chicken bowl tom kah soup and crab rangoon It s cheap and delicious 
bnZp-H-prU3Z5tNWr_MmBw CMU The lunch specials are OK but you get bored of them very fast There are more expensive dishes which are good but the price range is comparable to Little Asia and Eat Unique If you are considering something 9 OE that s what many people called is not the best place to go Try Little Asia Eat Unique LuLu or Quiznos However if you want it cheap and a lot of it OE is the best choice around S Craig 
BojXiu7j_XQALr_1CTnfJg CMU Of all the places I ever went to on a regular basis LuLu s Noodles is one of the places where I legitimately loved the food and wasn t just picking up a meal on a poor student budget I usually end up ordering ramen or a similar noodle soup after all noodles is in the company s name for a reason I have never had a bad experience here My food has always arrived in a timely fashion has been cooked properly and has featured only the best flavoring and seasoning possible An added bonus is that a Razzy Fresh yogurt shop is just down the street it s easy enough to pop in for dessert on the rare occasions that LuLu s enormous portions don t have me rolling to my car before I fall into a food coma I absolutely recommend LuLu s to all the food is delicious the portions fantastic considering the price and bound to satisfy anyone who has a craving for some noodles 
BqsHM5uIBl3ZJ9GGXzv16w CMU One of my two favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh I first came with my mom when I started at CMU and naturally we ordered Cantonese dish since we re Cantonese The dish was a tofu clay pot with seafood It was quite bland and I pegged this place as a bad place And then I rediscovered it And man am I glad I rediscovered it Stay away from the Cantonese dishes and all their food is fantastic I especially love their spicy boiled beef and their spicy chicken The spicy boiled beef is so flavorful and the meat is just absolutely tender I have yet to find another restaurant that can make the meat as tender as little Asia for Spicy boiled beef Spicy chicken is sweet tender chicken cooked with spicy green peppers I normally don t like chicken but this place makes it great I even eat the green peppers and I still think how delicious it is as the peppers run burning down my throat Their set meals for a lower price is cheaper but it doesn t pack the same flavor as ordering from the dinner menu Pick anything spicy from this place especially during those cold cold winter days and you ll fall in love with this place as much as I did Even now back in the bay area with their Asian food galore I still miss Little Asia 
BR5531T5W_7lwF8yyGOaCg CMU I went during hour before closing so your mileage may vary Cashier comped me a 10 discount I think students get this discount anytime bringing the buffet to 7 which includes drinks Everyone there except one table were Asian students The buffet itself was a selection of the most common Chinese dishes like Hunan Kung Pao chicken green beans hot and sour soup wonton soup The food was all OK nothing to distinguished Looking at the reviews I probably should have ordered off the menu but I was hungry and its hard to beat the service time of a buffet 
brTJd446YudjHPEk9DgEbQ CMU I know most people don t get what the fuss is about But this place just continues to be one of my favorite places to eat I know it s not special But the crab rangoon is amazing the egg rolls are delicious The Udon and the Pho soups are great The eggplant tofu delight is tasty with a wonderful sauce I fell in love with both Bubble Tea and Tom Kha soup at Lulu s The only reason I m not giving it 5 stars is because I know it s not a 5 star restaurant but it gets 5 stars in my heart Lulu s has never let me down and as long as I live in Pittsburgh I will always keep going back 
BwaR4HXq2zgVPsuf1aVLhA CMU Terrible food I do cut this place some slack in that it s in a very busy college area of town and it s supposed to have quick food for cheap However the food here is terrible The menu is huge that s not good and everything is high unauthentic How can you advertise something like pho on the menu and have it taste and look nothing like the dish from which it bares its name Noodle soup does not equal hot water no flavor and noodle plus some questionable pieces of meat I ve gotten sick from eating other Chinese dishes here Overall the food is just questionable 
BYX5bqnlIqh7r2WRH5HPjw CMU Yo I love cheap chinese food This place is pretty cheap and it s Chinese It even tasted good Unreal General Tso you my boy 
c0gCWzz5CbKbVZF4UQUVxA CMU Really greasy but if that s what you re looking for it tastes quite good 
c1A5TdqwJY_SMZ2VZ3EJ4g CMU The food is OK depending on what you order I d avoid the cheapest special menu Compared to the other restaurants near craig st it is pretty good especially when you take into account it is cheap The chow fun is good and the service is fast but not particularly friendly 
C2B5KeoeU7P-40uKhFD53A CMU Walking into Jimmy Tsang s was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five 0 it puts you back in time to the 1960 s and the food is reminiscent of that era also Hot Sour soup was highly americanized not very hot or very sour Wonton Soup was a very large portion and good Egg Rolls were large slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless not very good Cheese wonton s were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over powered the flavor Chinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good Flaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white clear cornstarch chicken base sauce that lacked much of any flavor except slat it was just okay Tea tasted like American Lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea pot The place was clean service was good prices are very good but the food was just average 
c2lviBUo_Ui3BvvbY1CbNw CMU I feel for the reviewers who think Lulu s is worth 5 stars The noodles here are edible three star college area food The bubble tea is tasty although I do belong to the group of people who prefer not to have chunky taro bits in the drink I ve never even considered asking for it without the bits because the service here is horrible This joint a great example of the many Pittsburgh businesses who have not yet realized that the demographic of the city is changing Debit and credit cards are not a fancy new invention that can be ignored at will Don t want to take my debit card at 4pm hey I m not longer breaking your asinine lunch rule Have shitty rude staff who will actually ignore me while trying to pay for my meal because they don t want to run the card I ll be eating somewhere else Food isn t worth the b s 
C7zN-t02MvxNaiKrwyJMMQ CMU One of the better Chinese food restaurants in Pittsburgh The food is pretty authentic and while they have your standard American Chinese food they have some genuine tasting Cantonese dishes too 
C9ZX9r3-_71xcUB6HzGawg CMU This place was OK but I probably wouldn t go back Food was kind of low end Chinese although service and atmosphere were fine Not really bad just not good either 
Ckx2OWlRbeYfPkMc8U5xtA CMU Greasy cheap chinese food Ordering was a bit confusing It seemed like there s about one employee who speaks English You get a big styrofoam box of whatever meat and vegetables you order with a lot of rice underneath Everything runs around five bucks So lots of bang for your dollar Food was prepared pretty quick I certainly wasn t wowed by the food but it was fine If I was drunk it would probably have been revelatory Food was expectedly Americanized The decor is kind of dumpy But this isn t a place you go for atmosphere anyway 
csyJbHJwRJZRqjKFSAHEgA CMU I love the pan fried noodles with chicken The sauce is delicious and just enough of the noodles are crispy I think it s actually the only main dish I ve ever ordered there because I love it so much The service is consistently slow and I ve been there a few times when they ve mixed up orders One time I was there with as part of a party of 4 They gave my dish to another group gave me the wrong dish and it took them like half an hour for them to get me my food Meanwhile the rest of my group was finishing up by the time I got mine It was infuriating Food consistently awesome 5 stars Service sooooo sllooooowwww 1 2 stars 
cwyNiy5XeygkWgPmfP3KlQ CMU Noodles Co offers quick service and reasonably priced competently prepared noodle dishes Good option for someone who wants a meal of decent quality with not enough time or money for a casual restaurant unless you re craving Asian noodles but more on that later The noodles taste fairly fresh and are all cooked to a nice al dente a rarity in Oakland s mass of mushy noodles The Italian and American offerings are all fairly satisfying albeit lackluster The dishes don t knock you away with bold exciting flavors but it s decent comfort food Steer clear of the Asian noodle plates Seriously Not only is this section of the menu awkward but a quick stroll to similarly priced Taiwan Cafe Szechuan Express Burma Tokyo or Spice Island Tea House will get you far superior Asian noodles be they Thai Indonesian Chinese or what have you 
CXHi6W0PVTYALW0XBEU3-g CMU Delicious food is the first thing I will say It probably helps that they have noodles as their main dish but the noodles that they serve you are nigh perfect I specifically recommend the Japanese Pan Noodles without the marinated steak though My noodles were served with a bit of cilantro for breath neutralization I assume and the iced tea is awesome Just don t get the sweet tea Seriously the market for sugar must have had a noticeable increase the day Noodles Company brought out their sweetened iced tea The atmosphere is very modern It makes me think of IKEA mixed with Asian minimalism And I mean that as a compliment not a criticism Lunch is pretty noisy but go in the late afternoon and you will be able to eat in solace All and all if you are looking for a good noodle restaurant but don t want the divey feel of LuLu s Noodles or you do want the clean feeling of a modern restaurant I would definitely recommend Noodles Company 
Cyk-YlaTJRcV5uBtKoGrlA CMU Love Lulus Who cares if it is authentic or not I wonder what authentic Asian food is really Lulus is fast Asian food and furious and cheap It was a regular go to lunch joint while I was in school in Oakland The school days are behind me but I still look for opportunities to go get a bite there when I can I like their noodles the rices but the small plates are my fave The pad thai is pretty decent again I don t know what authentic is if it tastes good I will eat it The bubble tea however is not the best The tapioca pearls are a little too hard for my liking The actual tea part is delish 
d0gqqwEB94XhtAztcYLTmg CMU LuLu s is a fave of the University crowd in Pittsburgh because it s convenient to several of the neaby schools it s cheap and it s good It s noisy and filled with the 20 somethings you would expect to find in a college town but there were indeed enough of those of us who are let s say not a 20 something to feel comfortable Menu has lots of choices that are familiar asian fare and they are apparently known for their noodle dishes Hubby and I decided on a pork and chicken entree respectively which were both surprisingly good considering how inexpensive they were You also get more than enough food to satisfy a ravinous appetite which we both had The kids had the General Tso chicken and a terriyake chicken dish which they proclaimed were deelish LuLu s also had a nice selection of fruit smoothie style drinks and they looked yummy Atmosphere is a litte frantic and the place is quite noisy so it s not the place for a date but if you are hungry don t have a lot of dough and want something quick and tasty LuLu s is a very good bet 
d0nJ3b95RI_mnp5T5nwndQ CMU My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh I had great experiences with their Korean selections like Bi Bim Bop Chicken Katsu and Jum Bon Must try Great atmosphere wonderful people reasonable prices 
d1ryXhkzz1lHJQqoLxvapg CMU This is my favorite restaurant well besides Nakama but who wants to have a favorite restaurant that costs 30 dollars a person I ve been here more times than any one location of a place It s a couple blocks away and all of my friends love it it s just a really good central location My favorite thing about Lulu s is the bubble tea and even though there are three other places within 1000 feet to get it the bubbles at Lulu s taste the best by far I ve got into a rut of always ordering K1 with chicken with double sauce without peanuts that probably one day the waitress will already know Though I ve had many other things and liked them all 
d3Fd-q3iJnUqr71xynHH5g CMU I am picky as hell and when I find a place I like I tend to order the same thing over and over which makes me not such a great reviewer At this place I tend to always get steamed chicken and vegetables or steamed tofu and vegetables white sauce on the side The food is always steamed just right and keeping the sauce on the side eliminates any typical greasy chinese food quality Plenty of food nicely done Their hot and sour soup is good but I wish it didn t contain pork But most places do The reason I need to review this place is because they have got the best steamed vegetables dumplings you will find anywhere in America and I am writing this from CALIFORNIA where I am surrounded by Asians so I should know OK maybe I am not a dumpling expert But theirs are damn tasty and I wish I could find something like them out here Every time I go home I need to get pho at LuLus and dumplings at Silk Pagoda They are AWESOME I wish I could have a truckload shipped to me 
d6e9LZ5ec4lNnPxiIDLsmQ CMU Can t give OE 5 stars Only they can get away with only giving me 2 strings of baby bok choy in my noodle soup because it s so damn cheap and fast But a combination of knowing what to order and getting over the angry Chinese lady means consistently cheap meals in a pinch The secret is to call in and then pick up your order Given their magically quick turn around times by the time you get there the food will be bagged You just pay and go The Noodle Soups are always a safe choice They are a bit plain bland but that s easily solved with the Sriracha or Chili sauce Make sure to snag some before you go There s also always the 5 50 menu Cheap and enough food to last you 2 meals I like the Chinese Veggies over Rice Avoid the bubble tea The balls are hard Unfortunately there really is no good bubble tea in this area Orient Kitchen OK is the sister restaurant of OE It s owned by the same family but with a different friendlier staff If you want an attentive pamper me all meal experience go there before slamming these folks They re just being efficient OE caters toward starving college kids who could care less about service Plus Chinese restaurants just don t do what people here expect to be good service Cry me a river I d actually be skeptical if any non upscale Chinese restaurant s employees were smiling and bowing and fluttering Bad service decent cheap Chinese food 
D79xAqMoaKMkCyQCD9IiTA CMU eOn my first visit I tried the Japanese pan noodles with shrimp and made it a triple combo with a small bowl of the thai curry soup The thai curry soup was actually quite delicious with pieces of spinach mushrooms and carrots but the noodles were a little undercooked making them hard and almost unpalatable The pan noodle in the small portion is quite small and the sauce was good super salty but but the noodles were on the dry side The shrimp were a little gross they weren t fresh and had the weird taste that cheap frozen shrimp have There were about 6 small shrimp in the dish On my second visit I ordered the pad thai and was completely disappointed There were barely any pieces of egg and what was in the dish were dried precooked pieces of egg that were thrown in when the dish was assembled This place is unique in that it offers many different types of pasta and noodle dishes but it is far from authentic when it comes to the Asian choices from what I ve tried so far The novelty of this place has caught Oakand s attention as this place is constantly busy and always has a line during peak times It is convenient and relatively fast and the prices are on par with the panera across the street But I highly recommend that Pitt students and others take their money to the numerous small businesses in Oakland Noodles Company is a chain that tries to grasp authenticity but never quite makes it there I suggest Lulu s noodles on Craig street for pad thai their scrambled eggs for the pad thai are made to order and not scant in quantity like in N C s meager and almost pitiful dish I looked on their website and they do offer a free meal to people who sign up for their email list on their birthday I signed up as my birthday is in a few days I find that I will probably frequent this place more than I honestly wish to I gave this chain three stars for the convenience speed and overall package of this place at least its not another mcdonalds 
Da24Ne9RsA0SqcFIXtagew CMU China Palace offers both Americanized Chinese Food and more authentic style dishes A good portion of their menu is populated by items such as General Tso s Chicken and Moo Shu Chicken but there are also more authentic dishes such as Szechuan Water Boiled Beef shui zhu nio and Yu xiang Eggplant Personally I have to say the Water Boiled Beef is both the best Water Boiled Beef I ve had in Pittsburgh and also the best dish I ve had at China Palace I like all my spicy dishes with extra spicy Their Americanized offerings are also cooked pretty well definitely better than take out restaurants Contrary to popular belief China Palace actually has a Taiwanese owner and not an American owner China Palace is nice as you can go there with people with more Americanized palates if you have a more Asian palate or vice versa and you can please everyone Prices run from around 9 dollars to upper teens for some of the chef s specials Highly Recommended 
dayJqB9R0LHiC_3DKF4RRQ CMU Great food very efficient and friendly service 
DazvUsft7MbUuT4JIXQbew CMU I recall walking in and standing right in front of two employees who just continued their convo while I patiently waited to be served Finally after at least 5 minutes I was addressed and I placed my order I couldn t tell if the server was unfriendly if it was merely a cultural thing or if he just had trouble understanding me Anyway since I m giving the benefit of the doubt here I increased my ranking by one star I ordered the beef noodle soup and it was terrible too spicy and the beef had a weird taste to it Usually after I leave establishments one of the employees will either say thank you have a good day or something but not in this place A few things to take into account are that the employees were college age and it was pretty close to closing time so that could have impacted the level of service All in all I just did not enjoy my experience and I won t be returning 
DGI2p3i3LO6wVKcvyMmWcA CMU Sometimes you re just in the mood for greasy chinese and this place delivers Everything is flavorful and it tastes like it was freshly made It s much better than HowLee or Lulu s They deliver to a pretty good radius too it s two and a half miles from there to my apartment 
Dh-nTC-fkhFM5Cyu1AR53w CMU I don t typically do Chinese buffets But this one came highly recommended Rather the conversation was I cannot believe you have worked in Oakland for 6 years and have never gone here We went here every Friday and when venturing out to lunch today without a plan I suggested this place Worth a shot I guess My first impression was the cantaloupe it was good and in season But ok getting to the actual Chinese food I had the chicken and broccoli the general tso s an egg roll some of their fried mushrooms with sweet and sour sauce some vegetable lo mien a biscuit and some fried dumpling with a creamy filling that tasted somewhat like onions Overall very good The lo mien and the mushrooms were the best The biscuit is the Chinese donut type spongy with sugar It was typical The general tso s was surprisingly good To me general tso s is often too gooped up in sweet and sour sauce with rubbery chicken that tastes like it was microwaved No this was pretty good The egg roll yeah that s the only thing I wasn t a huge fan of but overall 6 26 for a full buffet and a drink You can t beat that AND now I ve found a Chinese buffet that actually has decent food Yay For reference there were a bunch of Asian people eating there I tend to use that as a marker for how authentic edible the food is I like to think I d be a pretty good judge of pizza or hamburgers in China if the tables were turned 
Dmtnf8Yj7iiPXZu8OP2oqw CMU Even as a vegetarian I felt REALLY silly ordering orange wheat gluten or sesame soy protein But their vegetarian menu is fantastic I m happy ordering veggies and tofu and Asian restaurants But I really miss sesame chicken and I can get it at China Palace The food itself is every so slightly above par It s a little sweet but not too oily I can t vouch for their meat dishes as the person I went with is also veg They really manage to create satisfying typical Chinese dishes with meat substitutes that would fool most meat eaters It s definately expensive we paid 40 for three entrees and a salad And there s other Chinese food that s just as good for less money But for vegetarians who miss typical dishes China Place is so the place to go 
DnVBuTZvcu-X4Q4c0TDAWQ CMU Blek Not only did the server take 15 minutes to take our order I had a crusty fork and the salt shaker on our table had a dried noodle attached to it I ve had way better Asian food and worked in Irvine CA for ten years so my standards are high admittedly My Ma Po Tofu tasted like it came out of a can My friend s veggie Pho had bland soup base and canned mushrooms that s a killer for me right there If you want really good Pho go to Tram s or Pho Mihn on Penn in Lawrenceville For suburb sushi try Chaya in Sq Hill And for good Korean go to Sushi Kim s in the Strip In fact I think any Asian place in Pittsburgh would be better than going here Or just save a few bucks and get a package of Ramen at the grocery store and add an egg to it Even that s better than the so called noodles at Lu Lu s 
DZ7cdp5KuOA-JVnB3pC-wg CMU i was never a particularly big fan of LuLu s but after my most recent visit I don t really have any interest in returning My boyfriend and I ordered drinks waters diet coke and then quite a while later the waitress returned to take our food order without bringing drinks A good while passed during which no one even came to check on us so that we could remind them that we needed drinks then our food arrived Without drinks I ordered a vegetable dish in which tofu is offered as a replacement for meat The dish arrived with about four small pieces of tofu The vegetables were bland and salty I left hungry The prices aren t bad but it really shows in the quality it s not one of those hole in the wall well kept secret type place There is a reason why the prices are cheap The food is not plentiful nor high quality and the service is terrible The only thing really going for it is the bubble tea I m really laid back about waitresses being busy but there were not many people in the restaurant And we didn t get our drinks until our meals were nearly finished 
e3v6Mtxcs1_0bmiV-Wzk9g CMU Known as OK back when I was at school in Pittsburgh this restaurant was the best for large groups 10 12 to share a big round table and share a good Chinese meal Our regular dishes included fresh vegetables do miao bakchoy bai chai salty pork chops salty squid general tso s chicken mapo tofu and other dishes we would miss from back home Also try the California Roll it s not typical and has a bit of a Cantonese twist to it Maybe it s the rice but I think it s yummy This place reminds me of a restaurant you can find in Chinatown or Flushing NY The food is pretty good and if you re craving Chinese food not the take out kind OK can hit the spot 
eA0RWH9rhawJZPYEFaIjnQ CMU Nope Just no Slow service inconsistency in dishes sometimes lukewarm food pervasive blandness and ingredients that have been sitting out too long are what await potential patrons standing awkwardly in the doorway unsure of when and where to sit Given the sloppiness evident from a seat in the dining room so to speak I don t even want to know what other rules of running a decent restaurant are routinely ignored in that kitchen Simply put Forget taste I don t trust the kitchen here not to make me sick I ll be a happy Oakland resident when this place closes and something else moves in Right now it s just taking up space 
ehIC_hlJM34VJoIFiIxaPA CMU I love this place I walked past it for a year before I went in because of the weird entry The owners are very nice the sushi is top notch and the custard buns from the dim sum menu always make my meal complete 
EkQRSU2-GitOH_3KX6t8CA CMU Lulu s serves pretty bad food but they have a genius business model All they did was take the normal chinese food distribution model those tiny bits of pork with the red outside and brown inside general tso s fried maxo greasy noodles but glazed it over with a bit more of a college aesthetic You know a menu with a bigger font pop music blasting which is actually kind of great and non drab colorful decor Service is slow like your momma slow 
eNG-g3uHT0fpGk0kpXsQtg CMU The food was good Even the won ton soap that boasted to be straight from San Francisco seemed to be very similar to the won ton soup that you get in the authentic SF Chinatown spots I had the greens with shrimp basic simple satisfying The melon tea was waaay to sweet for me and didn t really seem like tea My big issue with this place is that it is loud as hell I could hardly hear myself think 
eSehjQDkkInNE6MFHN6scA CMU General tso s chicken was bad just bad too soy saucy it needs more tanginess It didn t taste the way that it should be I am never going to order their General tso ever again Never ever whatsoever 
etGU9JRtllUorqO-xPcHyg CMU This place is decent The service is good and fast but the food is not great It s edible but not good enough for me to go back a second time I had the Pad Thai and added chicken which cost me an extra 3 The chicken turned out to be fake and the noodles gummy I would really not recommend 
eUK7dl_9FiBmoPZfzLtnTw CMU The food here is consistently good but the service is pretty miserable All I wanted was take out Admittedly it was a busy night but c mon bad service for take out Other than that it looked like other people were doing just ifne and enjoying their dishes I kept it really simple and had white rice and some steamed veggies which did have a little bit of a sauce on them They had a nice flavor and I left with about a 10 bill including an iced tea When I tried to pay with a credit card the woman said Don t you have cash I looked at her in complete bewilderment Who the hell says that to a customer Clearly she was feeling stressed out so rather than make a scene I decided to part with a few greenbacks I d like to go again and try out the eat in option to see if they ll do better next time C mon Lulu s Don t be a dick be a dude 
EV0yqDaQcH40AkXdUACDrQ CMU Pretty good place as long as you don t get the buffet It s common knowledge amongst the Asian folks that you need to order from the menu Canto style food The fried tofu is good and is coated in a fairly unique batter The other dishes are less notable but fairly tasty Preparation and presentation is a kinda coarse My friends and I usually ordered from a small subset of the menu fried tofu salt and pepper pork chops salt and pepper squid some pig intestine dish I forget the name of char siu pork 8 treasure clay pot Tip If you re picky ask the waitress when the char siu was made Being Pittsburgh it may take a few days before the old batch is finished and the new batch is prepared The Golden Palace in downtown has the same food and owners 
eYeA0xZSabhmEU_uRlPs9Q CMU Some dishes are good 
fawAjh1s5xbHiGWKB873jg CMU I ve eaten at Lulu s too many times to count I always get dragged here by friends and family against my better judgment I have cousins who ve worked here but that doesn t mean I have to like the food Now I don t care if Asian food tastes authentic but I care if it tastes good The only Pittsburgh food that I like less than Lulu s is the blood pressure inducing salty dishes at Rose Tea Cafe go figure everyone seems to like that place as well Go to Bangkok Balcony instead for something nice or even Orient Express if you re in a hurry That said the restaurant environment is kind of nice especially considering how inexpensive the place is And the service is usually decent 
FCjxRBNTEXijBCBRTdWvJA CMU Meh I ve experienced better The food is mediocre and the service is slow For better pad thai try Spice Island Tea House 
fCTztzlRqE9Out-k8ONosA CMU I tried the pan fried crispy noodles with chicken and the pad thai Both were disgusting I actually had to return the pan fried noodles because it was not edible 
Fdwzaq27xOKOva7-cKnsxA CMU This popular college hangout is affordably priced with a menu including many Chinese and Thai favorites It s not meant to be fine cuisine and it s not meant to be authentic but plenty of options will satisfy a craving or provide you with plenty of fuel for a good price 
fgLH2w1I0bOb_Z_QL8_U7w CMU To clear up any confusion the new name is Sichuan Gourmet The restaurant was losing too much business to another China Star on Murray Ave in Greenfield Sichuan Gourmet is authentic Sichuan This is the food that the Chinese G20 Delegation ate when they were in Pittsburgh The food is wonderful and the service is very attentive I like this new location and it looks like they will thrive in Squirrel Hill The Tan Tan Noodles are a great appetizer to start with I like the Flaming Pan dishes 
Fk1NSZCpcnvt4LfHIvCWRw CMU Well on the bright side this place is fairly cheap and the portions are ginormous I live right next door since I go to CMU and it s great to have something cheap close by On the other hand the food is just ok I guess I came in with high standards having moved from the Bay Area which is almost like little Asia I had the Thai Curry Chicken which didn t have the depth of flavor most thai curries do but it was passable The other people I went with had Lo Mein which I didn t like at all and Fried Tofu which was fine Their service was great for me The woman who was serving us was nice and she even split the check by person for us which many places don t do On the whole I like their milk teas so I ll be back for those and of course the cheap food 
FmUt_zZLaFUvDlW5jhyxGA CMU Yep closed My dad and I were gonna come here dinner last night He called me and told me to meet him at China Palace instead So long Jummy Tsang s You were one of the last of the old time Chinese joints 
FOixzP1BURjQEECXTfhKYg CMU Average menu average food average prices 
FWIUdMy_WZ2HQwjAYpJp7g CMU i was too kind before this place is a two and honestly it s a pretty weak two last night my girl and i tried to go to chinatown inn at about 8 55pm assuming that it was open later than 9pm our bad it closes at 9 9 30pm on wednesdays so we scrapped that plan but still wanted some chinese food according to the yelp app lulu s is open until 10pm so even though we were super disappointed that we wouldn t be getting the amazing wonton soup at chinatown inn we headed on over to oakland for some average noodles at average prices when we walked in at 9 10pm we were immediately told that we could order takeout but couldn t eat in the restaurant okay fine understood the staff has to cut the line somewhere but 50 minutes early anyway we begrudgingly ordered our food it came out quickly actually before many people s dishes who were actually allowed to eat in the restaurant me and my doctor girlfriend we ate outside on a bench like hobos keeping it real classy on craig street truly we re not fancy people remember we go to ritter s at least once a week so we would have been fine with the whole situation had the food been good but it was totally meh the chicken was rubbery the vegetables were flaccid yes flaccid and the basil dish was spicy but not all that flavorful sorry lulu s i used to be ambivalent about you which works for me when we re eating late and kinda desperate but weird service and un passable food meh sums it up we won t be returning anytime soon 
G-tZepkpKCJwy_pl4wuI2A CMU The food here was greasy uninspired and bland The mockmeat chicken was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites I was also disappointed that they don t serve brown rice The service was friendly enough though Not to be recommended unless you re desperate 
G0ViKwiydh2rIZ-SKu_okw CMU Their Amazing Chicken is actually pretty amazing it s definitely better than their General Tso s cause it has softer meat 
g4K1QuX6HMCbHiT4TZfQlg CMU I had lunch at Lulu s today after St Paul s Easter mass only as a last resort because Crepes Parisiennes and Eat Unique were both closed for the day I had two bad experiences at Lulu s before but that was about a year ago and I was hungry The memories of past horrible food had faded gently in my mind and I was feeling forgiving Big mistake I ordered the BBQ pork noodle bowl and Bob the Boyfriend ordered ramen The food came out fast enough so no complaints there But from the first bite it was clear that things had gone horribly awry The pork on top of the bowl looked and tasted like something a dog would gnaw on tough dry and very salty Underneath my noodles were completely unseasoned just rice vermicelli with nothing else to speak of As for the boyfriend Bob s ramen was technically ramen I guess since the noodles were ramen noodles But instead of a savory beef or pork broth his noodles were backstroking in miso While this is weird and cheap ass of them I can t complain since the broth was clearly described as miso on the menu But the real problem was the miso broth itself The amount of miso in it made my tongue curl It was so salty it was almost inedible When the waitress asked me if everything was OK I told her plainly about the dry pork and the bland noodles and she said Yup that s the way it comes I was stunned and didn t know what to say so I asked her to suggest something else She recommended the Singapore rice noodles The Singapore noodles came out after a short wait and the noodle bowl mercifully disappeared But then the new noodles were so heavily spiced that they were again almost inedible Certainly not bland this time though I have to wonder if they were messing with me Finally we asked for to go boxes and high tailed it out of there It was a depressing bad experience Other notes The atmosphere is horrid loud music completely crowded and the waitstaff is aloof almost bitchy I m aware that this review has turned into a bit of a rant The fact is as I mentioned earlier I ve had two bad experiences there before I ll spare you the details I am hoping this review will serve as a reminder to myself in the future Erin it doesn t matter how hungry you are or how much people try to talk you into Lulu s Don t cave Hold out for Rose Tea or anything really anything else DON T DO IT 
GasUfXTQi-SxgQCGEjP7Dw CMU In general I d rather explore somewhere new than go back to an old familiar spot Not so with China Star i went 2 weeks ago and have been back a total of 3 times since Yes it s that good They have an american chinese menu and a traditional chinese menu so be sure to request the authentic one if you have a taste for the exotic All their food is good but I LOVE spicy food and their Szechuan food doesn t pull any punches The hot pots in a sizzling pepper broth are brought out still boiling and are as good as any Schuzuan I ve ever had They have a huge selection in general and vegetarians won t have any trouble finding a ton of great options to choose from Ordering from here always takes a while not because of anything wrong with the service but because it takes so long to scan through the endless menu and narrow it down from all the amazing choices Reasonably priced friendly service and authentic delicious Chinese food LOVE IT 
gEbZBQd75RSdppFUYMrxvg CMU I have flown 3 000 miles to eat at LuLu s OK that s not exactly true BUT I am from Pittsburgh I went to college at Carnegie Mellon I ate here a LOT in college and whenever I go home to visit I insist we eat here multiple times I have dragged my husband and son here up to 3 times in a week long visit We still have a few college friends in the area so there is still the chance to meet at LuLu s and really make it feel like old times I love the food but I will admit part of the appeal is that chance to relieve one s prime who knows I love their pho either with chicken or veggies tofu and their thai curry chicken either with chicken or tofu They have no problem making either one without onions good for me because I am picky Love their fried red bean won tons Love their bubble drinks which I think are fairly new they didn t have those when i was in college Love their slightly engrishy menu I think it s the hot and sour soup where they claim And wow is it good Love the goofy pictures on the walls of the kids and noodles wonder what those kids are up to now So weird to go there and know they re getting old just like the rest of us but there they are young and covered in noodles Good times good food Yeah the service can suck we call it the LuLu s experience to note how the food never all comes out at one time so one person will be finishing as another is just getting their food and if you ask for water to drink it tastes like it came out of the hose But I love LuLus and no trip to Pittsburgh would be complete without at least one meal there 
gIJiX_suJgjRcoUdBlTxiA CMU I can see why this place has an average of 3 5 stars Let s face it it s a U of Pitt CMU college kid in general eatery You go there because it s cheap and close by and relatively good My dad and I like to order the Singapore Rice Noodles it s a little spicy with a hint of yellow curry and has delicious shrimp egg pork etc in it Verrry tasty I usually get scallion crepes and bubble tea too You pretty much just have to know what is good and what s not here The kitchen does get kinda backed up sometimes as another reviewer put so yeah the wait probably isn t worth it some nights 
giSItGIA4rwtijnsyk_d3w CMU An interesting mix of authentic and Americanized offerings is available at China Star The crispy noodles served at the start of the meal come with only duck sauce Make sure to ask for the hot mustard to mix with it The steamed pork dumplings had an odd flavor the filling had a taste almost reminiscent of a hot dog s meat Certainly not what I was expecting The egg roll tasted fresh but extremely bland I wouldn t recommend them From previous visits we had found we didn t like their Peking duck so we tried their tea smoked duck instead I must admit it is a much better choice when you re in the mood for duck The best part of the meal was the Flaming Fish Pan I ordered it based on Ishi G s recommendation and I was not dissapointed The fish is moist and delicious while the sauce was hot in both meanings of the word Spicy thanks to the pepper and boiling thanks to the flame burning beneath it A must order if you like fish 
GJOlN7ue82nQllHHDZA-rQ CMU i am definitely not a fan of orient express the food is just ok and the boba is disgusting the tapioca balls served as this place are hard as rock i might have to add that i am an asian originally from southern ca where asian food or generally food is just better overall but i am definitely not impressed with this place i would rather go to lulu s anyday however the review below mine should concentrate more on the specifics of orient express rather than an attack on asian culture 
Gl5BdmyPV_h_SoNQMJ1hwg CMU I liked it Huge portions not too expensive and it s really nice inside I like my cheesy general tsos what can I say It s not cuisine but if you want a big fat plate of sweet and sour pork in a relaxed ambience it s great I m psyched that they deliver 
Gnir8UDuEJ9-5F-j7hcyXw CMU I don t understand why my classmates love coming to this place It s cheap Chinese food that is not good Their beef is kinda funny in texture taste Their General Tso s chicken is soggy and super fat and has an iron taste to it Place is kinda stuffy If it weren t for my classmates I would not visit this place 
GvM1h-t2BKdD9IwBCJHpnQ CMU I went to LuLu s dozens of times during my undergrad at CMU Basically it is cheap with decent portions and the food is pretty good if you get the right dish Stick to the noodle dishes and you will be good Most of the time I stuck with the Chow Fun Beef Are there better places Certainly try Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill But for price it is pretty good 
GVolmlyctlUPIuzfkXlVyQ CMU Went there for lunch A place worthy a 6 7 7 for credit cards buffet with a drink Chickens orange hot General Tso s are generally good As others comments have mentioned more greasy and oily than expected Do not get too much meat and try to have veges to neutralize Rice noodle is a great choice if you have too much meat like me Anyway you cannot criticize a 7 buffet that is as good as this one 
gwFbL5sFEghkw9xxcZWNvg CMU Decent cheap and quick pretty much describe O E I generally get take out coming back from a long day of lab work at CMU and it always hits the spot It s normally only a 5 minute wait to grab food and go Outside of a few staples sesame crispy beef chicken I ve been disappointed by trying a whole bunch of different options on the menu This place is better than some other items along Craig Street but it s certainly not the best As long as you don t go in expecting anything other than fast Chinese cuisine you ll probably be disappointed 
G_rWnQ_0FXMzMZdsfI3kuQ CMU Coming from Baltimore a city void of palatable Chinese food I was very surprised not to mention skeptical that a great Szechuan restaurant would be found in Pittsburgh I m glad I was wrong The braised pork shoulder is a conversation piece beautifully prepared and tender to the bite I also tried the spicy beef noodle soup and the crispy pork noodles If you don t like spicy stay away but this stuff was delicious I was literally sweating with elation Gross and wonderful at the same time Next time I want to try the whole fish or the hot pot So much to look forward too 
h4FkKTQjljR4qFy7Bp1JNg CMU It s cheap it s fast it certainly is not fancy but this is as good as it gets You want good asian go to a place frequented by lots of people of european descent If you want autenticity go to the place that is packed with asians This is a Pitt CMU tradition and the heart of Asian Alley on Oakland Avenue There is no decor it s packed in and certinaly could use some renovations Save the complaints for a different style This is 100 authentic Szechuan chinese and you should appreciate the complexity and style of the food served here 
HaE4hzT_1KY4KdYzAKllEA CMU If you like authentic Chinese food like me you will love this place I am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons here I guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and Americanized food I never tried the Americanized dishes but the Chinese ones are decent I always just order their specials which are listed on the first page of their menu My favorite dishes are Chinese style mapo tofu Beijing duck you need to order it ahead fish with the spicy sauce The spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers It has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots 
HDJyUbaRVN4vN-2r_j7U6w CMU Moving from the Midwest I was pumped when I found this place at their former location in Squirrel Hill and discovered their vast vegetarian menu General Tso s soy protein is a winner although a bit sweet They retained their veg menu at their Shadyside site and it s the same Lunch is the way to go here very expensive otherwise Beware of soup kind of got congealed in transit Overall this place holds a special place in my heart as it s very veg friendly However there are better Chinese places in PGH 
hEwXqZRret4ZCI8OCKb04A CMU The portions are huge Reasonable price The fish I ordered was decent 
hhWhTp_7h1GaPv0vE12oZw CMU Help I ve died and gone to Chinese food heaven I highly recommend trying what China Star has to offer Their Sichuan menu is frankly amazing I adore the Flaming Fish Pan Oh my goodness is this dish amazing Soft succulent white fish in a mini wok filled with sizzling garlic sauce mushroom and saut ed bracken This is a huge portion that can easily be split between 3 people although I could totally hog it for myself One word of caution the sauce is mainly oil based so I suggest eating in and having it while it s hot The steamed dumplings are fantastic and so is their garlic eggplant and mushroom bok choy dish Just writing this review has made want to go back for more Their service has always been friendly and you can ask them for the true authentic choices I can t wait to continue exploring the rest of their menu 
hktGmS7XxLyla3Yczi3Hmg CMU I would rank this place closer to 1 5 stars I like their super large and cheap helping of crab ragoon but not much else Everything else here has been pretty gross I had their duck once and it was super old duck I m sure it was cooked for at least 3 days and then stuck in the oven to heat up so it was super dry tough and disgusting That pretty much sums everything up Every time I come here I am disappointed Why I continue to visit is beyond me 
Hld1LKMrJhvoDaI9k77IWw CMU I love the lunch specials esp the Thursday one that comes with an eggroll good prices and the soup hot tea is great comfort food for when you re trying to keep warm and fight off a cold 
HovjQMHRQSKBOJl-ro5M4g CMU Yelp says 2 stars means Meh I ve experienced better which is exactly how I felt about our dinner from here tonight We ordered two entrees one egg roll and an order of cheese wontons The person on the phone taking our order told us it would take 30 minutes for delivery and did not tell us the price We live less than 1 5 miles away and called early not during the typical dinner time rush but the delivery took a bit longer than 30 minutes The total was 29 80 before tip which seems a bit pricey The food was just mediocre The cheese wontons were okay but the cheese tasted just a bit off The tofu homestyle was bland and the sauce had an odd aftertaste The only vegetables were carrots snow peas and a few small pieces of bamboo none of which were flavorful The Gold Sesame Chicken is described as having a sophisticated brown sauce but really it was either General Tso s or sweet and sour sauce There were two tiny broccoli florets in the dish did they fall in accidentally I wanted to like it it would be very convenient for me but it was nothing impressive 
HPJExIDsAFiw8hV58K2LiA CMU First note If the reviewer s hometown ends in CA don t trust the review Stuffy declarations about the authenticity of the food are waaaaay out of context in this scenario And listen stuck up Californians I used to live in WUHAN CHINA and I like it So shut up It s not authentic and that s the point Lulu s is cheap Let us not forget this Your table might be a little sticky the place may be a little loud and the decor may be a little goofy but if you are here and you know what you re getting into you know there will be a delicious abundance of carbohydrates headed your way for very little money I ve read a lot of accusations that the staff there is rude I haven t seen this at all having now been there a number of times Singapore Rice Noodles is what you get when you go to Lulu s if you re me There are probably other things that are really tasty too but the Singapore Noodles are consistently recommended by everyone I talk to about this place I ve never had the bubbletea I m not really a sweet drinks kind of fellah I m sure I ll try it someday though Go here for a quick cheap bite Don t listen to the naysayers 
hQg0B0UYNxH6DtbcvSzN-w CMU I ve been meaning to try this place for awhile now and tonight i had my chance I have been hearing great things about it but i didn t want to buy into the new lunchbreak eats hype The interior is clean and brightly lit which is always a plus in my book The employees are friendly and efficient i ordered the bangkok curry which didn t look like a curry at all but it tasted delicious The veggies were crisp and the noodles held up nicely to the light sauce My only problem is the value I paid almost 9 for tofu veggies and noodles which would be fine if i had some leftovers for the next day but that was not the case I could go to any of the food trucks on Bigelow or at CMU and get the same quality except faster and cheaper with bigger portions 
hSq6O_hMXcHQnEqVBc8yWw CMU The sushi bar their recent addition in their menus seems to bring more people in this place which is good for their business But the downside is that everything got SUPER SLOW I went there at around noon and had to wait FOREVER for my foods it was more than 30 min I don t think it s acceptable by any standard They seriously need to learn how to streamline their services or if not hire more cooks more servers And why the hell do they speak Chinese to non Chinese people Please do speak English On top of that the worst part is that THEY CHARGED SOMEONE ELSE S TABLE TO MY CARD AND GAVE MY CARD TO THAT PERSON AND GOT ME THAT PERSON S CARD BACK AFTER PAYMENT Luckily I checked my bank account the next morning and found out right away there were TWO transactions from Little Asia and the one I didn t recognize It turned out they accidentally swiped my card for that other table and gave my card to that person who used it later that day without knowing it s not his or hers They made a horribly stupid mistake of mixing the two customers cards up How lame 
Hw3M7IpDRLijXeF7VMX8gg CMU Worth the money but not too great All of the dishes were less than 10 dollars and the portions are really big However what you get is basically a bowl of noodles with very few vegetables and meat If you re looking for a cheap filling meal this is a great place If you want good Asian food look elsewhere 
h_Z_hBVDDScjbDwzTfTHwg CMU Cafeteria Korean Thai and Chinese culinary low end The menu has many options and after trying many of them I have come to the conclusion that the food is half assed in authenticity but more a place to grab something quick for college students who want cheap food without the fuss and may not know of better restaurants Slow bad service kind of dirty stale environment I m not a big fan of Chinese food to begin with so I have gone for the noodle Thai dishes more often I don t even know why I kept going back besides my ex really liked General Tso s chicken and would grab takeout on his way home from work These were all bland boring nothing special and never ordered again Sweet and sour chicken shrimp NO Spicy Basil all spice could taste nothing else Dr Fu special never get seafood here Below were the items that were just OK No complaints but no accolades either Cucumber salad not so bad Pad Thai Frozen pad Thai is better Singapore Rice noodles flavorless chicken sauce do able Uhm so horrible the meat was that chewy gristle kind that you spit out into the napkin Sesame cold noodles worms in peanut butter sauce Lard Nar Bbq pork gummy noodles like eating mush Pho worst ever nothing like good pho bad broth The bubble smoothies are really good except I can t stand the tapioca fish egg consistency No bubbles for me and no more Lulu s either 
I1l0Sv3VByCq4rGCrlSBUg CMU I m a huge fan of Sichuan food so I tend to love all Chinese restaurants that serve authentic Sichuan dishes And I tend to be nice and give pretty good reviews in general because I know how hard the restaurant business can be However given that I had just tried How Lee the week before China Star was a bit of a disappointment We ordered off the Chinese menu and most of the food was just so so The tofu in the ma po tofu was definitely spoiled and on it s way to being fermented tofu although I couldn t make a big deal about it because everyone had eaten it already The spicy fish in chili oil was not nearly as good as How Lee s Some people wanted to be adventurous and ordered the frog and a rabbit dish The flavors were decent but it was all bones and I ve had plenty of meatier frog and rabbit before The service was terrible even for a Chinese restaurant They got mad at us because 3 people cancelled last minute and we had 14 people instead of 17 and half the dishes were already eaten before everyone got even a glass of water We asked for tea and they gave us TWO tea cups The rest of the tea cups came with the dessert oranges unbelievable The first thing you should get at any Chinese restaurant is tea and it wasn t even like we didn t speak Chinese On top of that the party next door to us was getting wasted and they had people stumbling to the bathroom to puke There was literally puke in the sink of BOTH the men s and the women s restroom and no one bothered to clean it up Gross Maybe some day I will be forced to come here again with a big group of people and maybe I ll have a better experience then but this was a terrible first impression 
I2eSqBj-Vc76o9hCxGAeTQ CMU Hallelujah An authentic Chinese restaurant smack in the middle of Squirrel Hill In my three years in Pittsburgh so far I m often asked How do you like Pittsburgh And my answer is always It s exceeded my expectations and I mean that in the best way possible But then I always have to temper my enthusiasm with the fact that there is absolutely no reasonable Chinese fare to be had that and I miss being around tons of Asian Americans Anyway I used to pass by this place and think If they do dim sum AND Japanese food and whatever else kind of Asian food they think they cook they must do everything poorly Apparently that wasn t so far off But a few months ago I noticed that the signage had changed and that when I looked in the windows the place was FULL of Chinese people And that my friends is the mark of a good Chinese restaurant I m sad to admit that I waited this long to try it since I live just a few blocks away but man oh man am I glad I did This is the real deal Sichuan spicy goodness We got the lo mein don t shoot me it was for my non Chinese husband garlic eggplant and fish fillets in hot pepper sauce broth literal translation from Chinese Water cooked fish OH MY GOD AWESOME I can t wait to try some of the other goodies they serve here But make no mistake come here for excellent Chinese food Thank the heavens above Pittsburgh culinary options really have come along 
i6LVrf12F-huTkJe7V051Q CMU This by far has been the best Chinese I have had in Pgh The service was great the food was clearly fresh and the restaurant was very clean Two thumbs up 
I95MOX_QFmtmJ4FUrMveJw CMU I m sorry but my latest experience here has been horrible We always come here for the salt bake squid Going on about 10 years now Today we received it and it looked horrible It was a dull dark orange color instead of a light orange color It was overcooked and had a burnt taste Obviously the quality of today s meal wasn t the same as our previous visits When the owner walked by we asked if the squid was old today She said no it s always fresh and that lots of people order salt bake squid today with no problems She said its the same chef same squid same way We told her we re not very happy with it today She seems frustrated by it She tried one then spit it back out She said she ll bring us another plate When the new plate came it looked exactly like the previous dull orange We expected she either gave us back the same plate or the chef did a bad job a second time around This time she mentioned it was a different chef What made it awkward is that she told us next time don t order the salt bake squid Because it is a hassle to cook and we should just eat what we get That just made things awkward for us We understand she doesn t want to lose money but we don t want to pay for something that we feel is low quality We reaffirm that money isn t the issue and we will gladly pay for the second dish which the owner rejected The rest of the meal she didn t come back to our table Her English is weak so maybe she didn t mean the way she meant when she told us not to order it next time We gave her a 40 tip that covered the 2nd dish and more But this experience left a bad taste in our mouths We re looking for salt bake squid alternatives now 
IdME_E8z_uHFa4CVUg3vEw CMU Noodles are pretty easy to make but sometimes you just need a cheap big lunch Lulu s is the place for that Sure I can make better noodle dishes myself but can I do it on my lunch break I have had both the Pad Thai and the Singapore Curry Noodles What they lack in authenticity they make up in volume I really enjoyed both dishes There are vegetarian options for almost everything you can get tofu instead of meat The Szechuan green beans also look good and I plan on getting that next time Do not go expecting a great restaurant experience It s a very loud undergraduate infested type of place This is a delight best sampled between classes or as takeout The lunch specials are very reasonably priced and I plan to take advantage 
iflZCAogmS0kZZNewAoq4g CMU You can see their second bar through the front windows I always assumed that that was their first bar and just walked by the place maybe a hundred times until walking in and noticing that everyone was drinking in a different bar In other words this place is huge inside The place looks like it was decorated about the same time many other cities built up chinatown areas I like the decor even if it might be slightly dated Chinese and Korean food at or above my expectations The stuff on the menu is good and they re willing to put together things that aren t on the menu if you ask nicely Kung pao tofu is my favorite so far 
IGWdcoE_FkzqJ_tZ6t8iNg CMU I initially had a very bad impression of this place before I came A lot of students view this place as a bit sketchy because of the speed that the food comes out No matter what we order food is always on the table in less then 10 minutes BUT despite all these misgivings my friend decided treated me here and I m SO glad I tried it It is so close to CMU and although it is not the most authentic Chinese food there is it is delicious fast cheap and has ridiculously large portions I ve come many times after the first initial time I tried it My favorite dish isn t on the menu it s called Crispy Sesame Beef and it comes with broccoli and rice NOMNOMS Oh and personally I find OE s pearl milk tea which comes hot or cold a lot better than LuLu s 
ilVqhUjO0xayef5IaDLt8Q CMU Abyssmal I stopped in here for a snack one day and ordered some dumplings Though I sat down in the restaurant they were served in a dismissing take away bag The dumplings were coated heavily in grease and the plastic container was filled with grease Consider this restaurant s food for a guest that you want to leave 
iMmoZPvl39e-j3eVYmucIg CMU The current 3 star average is about right I have not had the bubble tea here on any of my visits so I cannot comment on that It seems to be a popular item though The noodles are only ok I ve been somewhat all over the menu pho pad thai fried noodles lo mein Decent for the speed and feel of a restaurant like this but nothing stellar 
iQ_xV5BPMtRxv5ydpNHnkw CMU Great new chinese restaurant just opened two weeks ago at the former location of Pacific Ring They have an dauntingly long menu we ordered dou miao watercress fried whole riverfish beef tongue appetizer and the dumplings in chile oil yummy There is still much more i want to try from their menu and I haven t figured out what s best to eat from this place yet but what we ordered was really delicious 
iRSS-Q92S8_n57GrPSiVHg CMU I guess I d rate Silk Pagoda 3 1 2 stars I hadn t eaten here in awhile so when I came home from Dallas last week Rick and I ended up ordering delivery Feeling pretty hungry after my homecoming I was a little adventurous in ordering Seven Stars Around the Moon Gotta love poetic food names at Chinese places That s beef scallops chicken sauteed and Chinese vegetables surrounded by shrimp Yummy As always Silk Pagoda isn t the flashiest but it fills the bill 
ivF-YU4DiqQvLxsUYM3ByA CMU Terrible experience and we didnt even get to eat Our server told the host to seat us and then the server waited on everyone but us Other people sat minutes later and were taken care of and we waited patiently for 20 minutes with no service what so ever We felt like no one was willing to wait on us and were offended So after waiting for 20 minutes we walked out and will never go back 
IvSgHHhsaiZQclLqyDkEhQ CMU Visiting Pittsburgh we were looking for a cheap and quick fix for our hunger We came across this noodle shop near the library It was rather cold at the time and soup sounded delish It took them a while to make our food even though it was not that busy Their selections in food varied which may or may not be a good thing The service was decent and the atmosphere was bright and open Their green tea was not what I had anticipated however but it was nice way to get some warmth in my hungry tummy at the time As far as the food quality goes i would definitely say I ve had far better ramen but for the price I suppose it would suffice This definitely would not be the first restaurant that I would suggest to people but for their uber cheap price you cant go wrong 
j8KIzy-44tsGguujhTJazA CMU The BEST bubble smoothies I have ever tried My favorite is the peach and the strawberry is delicious as well The variety of food they have there is also amazing I like the pad thai there although I wish the spice level would be higher 
JGGqCANftLMfek_c36KSGQ CMU Yo These noodles fuckin suck Plate looked like homeless man vomit Pass 
jkBsSjGpPg_fbYG1LR4kQQ CMU Not much to see here The food was very bland and the service was slow We went on off hours around 4 00 and the food still took a long time To top it off the waitress didn t come back to take our credit card for 15 minutes We just about got up and walked out The place wasnt the cleanest either 
JpwJp05ItX97pD87yoq1aw CMU Best Pan Asian in Pittsburgh Great food and an affordable price Vegetarian Pad Thai is my favorite The bubble drinks are fantastic I Love Lulu s 
JrkZEjHqVqDmgfd9ol0sXw CMU I would definitely agree with many of the other reviews if you are looking for actual Asian food you better look somewhere else If you are looking for a quick fix of salt carbs and oil LuLu s is your best bet The portions are pretty big service is fast and the food is relatively cheap The lo mein and singapore style noodles are pretty good 
jSMugrpwsL9Yh0AC1U96Mw CMU So I guess I have no one to blame but myself for this one as much as I want to give them 2 stars I have to give them three for my poor decision making on getting the Shrimp Pad Thai here when I knew my obsession for Thai food was not going to benefit me at a place like this I should have opted for a different dish perhaps Mac and Cheese or sorts or some Italianish sort of thing Despite the location being new everyone seemed to have already been through the pains of being a new store Very busy too even though it was during the seasonal break which was why we opted to venture there when we did Service was quick and good I will definitely come back but the next visit will definitely not include Pad Thai 
JW95Au3-m5QphAtzbgj-4w CMU Yuck yuck yuck Awful 90 s decor worse music of all eras curt service and terrible food I had the Spicy Basil noodle plate which tasted like Ragu on rice noodles Cannot remember what my companion ordered but it tasted strange and made me glad for my own dish Veggies from cans and packages Chairs Nasa rejects I m pretty sure the busboy is a serial killer 
jyP49bZ7Srgw9AHh4slpdg CMU The food was average with some dishes below average I had to return one dish because it really tasted bad and they seemed anoyed They tried to tell me that kimchi is garlicky as if I had never tasted it before The reality is that the food tasted spoiled I wouldn t go back 
J_oHUsIv79Hte0sAby9uwA CMU The previous ownership was a lot better than the current one The food and service was a lot better I had to eat there twice today because everywhere else was closed I wasn t too pleased with the service so I tipped a little lower than usual As I left the restaurant the disgruntled waitress called me and demanded I pay more She got really rude and told me to order takeout in the future This used to be one of my favorite places to eat I m never going back again 
k0t2aOuoQXx_OBiOcHNp2A CMU very spicy and tasty chinese food friendly waiters who didn t seem to know the food 
k7Eb0s6KwxaCI5vf5JOvRA CMU not like what I expect 
kFf2TFYQUNLcQ1AwzgVzDA CMU The worst chinese food I ve had I got the General Tso s Chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when I asked for extra spicy Panda Express is better 
KkjPpqEwZO2use-PGe6JGw CMU I don t know why Little Asia only has three stars I love the food here way better than the 0 star Lulu s Noodles Little Asia serve both great fake and authentic Asian food All their dishes are under 10 00 My favorite ones are can t post in Chinese for some reason jiao yan xia shui zhu niu rou fu qi fei pian and hong you yu pian For the price Little Asia probably serve the best authentic Chinese food in Pittsburgh Rose Tea tends to be too saucy or salty for me but Little Asia cooks the food just right The waitress here are super nice and sweet The interior is a little weird after they moved But other than that I have no complaints I would pick Little Asia over Lulu s Noodles or Oriental Express anytime Also if you like ice cream they serve mochi ice cream which is outrageously delicious 
kL6d6iQAs7ycBowy5PqiqQ CMU DA Liciuos we love it there 
Kr8CFOlW-QVCF6swrza2dw CMU I will give this two stars now that I have finished CMU but while I was there I would have considered giving it three This place is there for students and it is good for that The food is cheap and passable Service is slow but usually friendly It is pretty much just your basic Pan Asian place nothing to special about it I would go there a good bit when I was at CMU and was on campus late working The slow service was a good excuse to take a long break from work If you are going to go I would recommend the noodle soups and the crab Rangoon but neither are worth more then a quick walk over from CMU 
kSa_hIBDlRPuA5tSkuVBLg CMU Lulu s is a dependable place to get decent asian food at a pretty cheap price There s nothing fantastic about any single aspect of the place but it s good enough and cheap enough to be a mainstay for the university populations 
kTzt1OcjMFaRrWuwJA4bSA CMU Their Hot and Sour soup is made as they say with a lot of different ingredients They aren t kidding the soup is phenomenal I finished a soup to go and I literally want to drive all the way back and get more I also had the Spicy Basil noodle plate It was okay it was a very large dish and very full of noodles I wasn t all too impressed but it was very filling 
kyla8a_yE12Un5jtby6cUQ CMU Well The good thing about Orient Express was that it was really close to the CMU campus so just walking down Forbes you can hit it real easy if you don t want chinese delivery The dumplings weren t too bad and the orange beef was pretty good too The beef had a decent crunch to it that paired well with the rice The food came out really really fast and it was nice and warm The service was decent They refilled my water without me needing to ask They also didn t really care if you brought your laptop in and did some work after eating your food either because they were never packed 
l5kJly3p0d2h9kL9iequWA CMU Even college students with no money should not be subjected to such horrible food This place is really horrible I went for lunch with a bunch of friends and the looks on their faces when the food came out was comical We were each trying to process what was on our plates They still dove in as did I but my fork was brought to a halt after first bite I ordered a cup of the tom kha gai and the cold peanut noodles The soup was tasteless Usually spicy coconut soup is a spicy and 2 tastes like coconuts and lemongrass This tasted like water The peanut noodles were the correct consistency but the sauce resembled those cheap sauces in the microwave Thai meals you can buy at the supermarket too much vinegar and mustard and not enough peanut and spice I tried a bit of my friends yellow curry and it was equally abhorrent It tasted like they took a bottle of yellow mustard and threw in a few chili peppers and that was it Do yourself a favor and skip this place 
lajOdY1cTSXPB9X6yXZn-A CMU This was one among the first places i visited when i attended CMU It s located on Craig St and gives you a chance to jump to someother restaurant if you don t like it But i am sure you wouldn t have done that the food is good and i am a great fan of their noodle bowls Their chicken dishes are yummy and my friend did complaint that she found shrimps in her veggie plate so watch out for that I do end up going there for lunch or dinner as its a walking distance from CMU And yes the name again attracted me Has anyoneswatched the cartoon Little Lulu Then watch it and all you would sing is Little lulu little lulu It would actually be weird hilarious if they played that cartoon in this place Three cheers to Lulu Smriti 
lB619DR-JMyl5iTF_PFmtw CMU I picked this place because the Yelp reviews were positive and it said they deliver They don t While I m not expecting the most amazing Chinese food ever to exist in Pittsburgh this was a disappointment even by my low standards They forgot a soup substituted one of the entrees for another which was apparently created only out of fried chicken skins based on the texture appearance and flavor says my husband I was uninterested in trying it and everything generally lacked flavor The search continues 
lC2L_JvmwwuD72aHgCMIow CMU After a long weekend of traveling I was treated to a meal at Noodles Company Upon inspection of their menu I was surprised to see that there were not a lot of soup based noodles but finally settled on the Japanese pan noodle dish It came out quickly and was delicious especially after adding some saracha My only con about the dish was that the sprouts were not cooked but placed on top raw The kitchen is in back of the cashiers which is nice so you can kind of see what is happening and this is a seat yourself place I like there are some high tables and low tables for which you can sit at and the service was friendly There was a homeless man who wandered into the store asking for money at each of the tables but one of the workers stepped in to ask the man to leave made sure that the homeless man left and then apologized to the patrons which I thought was handled very nicely There were quite a few people eating at this establishment at about 8pm on a Sunday I think I will go back and try a pasta dish 
LcddM5FGkkJIJ94LPsr2WA CMU A reasonably common spot for me friends to go being so close to CMU Food is decent but rather uninspired and prices are reasonable However be prepared to wait a while for that food though service here has been consistently poor whenever Ive gone 
LDuGCtXm8CCnO9NgBatWZw CMU Nice place super convenient for CMU people Food quality tends to vary but I have had some really good meals here Vegetarian friendly and awesome bubble teas In terms of service its like a campus restaurant which isn t really a problem for most of us 
LE3Yg_eE1ICZHuwqkh9hww CMU We got some takeout from here last week since it s just down the block We ordered from Campusfood and then put in the comments section We have a 20 off coupon which was on Pacific Ring s website This was in retrospect kind of stupid of us within 15 minutes we got a call from the restaurant saying that they can t honor coupons when you order from Campusfood Apparently Campusfood charges Pacific Ring 10 of every order total the price they pay for using the service I suppose Anyway since they re already paying 10 to Campusfood they don t honor coupons on top of that If you want to use coupons order direct from the restaurant That made sense and I apologized the lady said she d still give us 10 off anyway though which was nice of her The food was ready when they said it would be and we came back home with our chicken fried rice and Singapore style rice noodles I was immediately jealous of my boyfriend s chicken fried rice and immediately asked we re sharing right before taking a huge heapful of it onto my plate I love chicken fried rice so darn much Pacific Ring does a nice job of it and by that it means it is exactly what you d expect the same fried rice you can get anywhere Which means it s really tasty Because fried rice is awesome No new twist Just yumminess I was somewhat underwhelmed by my noodle dish It wasn t very seasoned just noodles with some chicken and shrimp with a vague hint of curry flavor There wasn t really a sauce to the dish seemed more like they d sprinkled curry powder on the noodles Tasted fine I guess but not as good as I d hoped We d order again it s convenient and pretty standard stuff Just what you d expect from Chinese takeout 
lfA1rksTYObO3Z_Um6aUOQ CMU Ordered from Silk Pagoda using GrubHub since we were unable to sneak away from the office WORST EXPERIENCE EVER Not only did the order take forever but most of the items were incorrect We had to call to get the order rectified and when we did they still did not get it right and it took forever The food was completely disappointing and the service was even more awful since they did not even seem the slightest bit apologetic about the mishap If you want good chinese food delivery there are better options 
lfUI87-eew_bd_X1-ltb_g CMU I used to enjoy their cold sesame noodles and fried wontons years ago but I have ordered them more recently and have not been impressed Their entrees lack crave ability and I ve been left unsatisfied many a visit Bubble smoothies are good if you want something cold and refreshing Otherwise standard menu sub par food and sub par service Yes it s affordable but you can get better food at a similar price elsewhere 
lH8tGTkc8wcNkro6HQsTmw CMU After searching around Pittsburgh for the kind of Chinese food that can fill the void for Golden Chopsticks in Wheeling I finally had a stroke of luck and found this place based on another Yelper s review As a vegetarian having so many options in one restaurant can be quite novel Their menu is extensive for both meat and vegetarian dishes Oh and the soups There s veggie wonton egg drop corn soup and vegetarian hot and sour JOY The entrees list is far too long to get into but I ll say that proteins include tofu and soy protein meat My personal favorite and go to entree is kung pao soy it is really good with extra spice if you like that sort of thing and veggie wonton and egg drop soups are my favorite A nice pot of tea accompanies your visit and the entree potions are large enough to share if you are in the sharing mood They also have a large lunch menu that includes a big portion of the dish you order and a soup The atmosphere at China Palace is pretty relaxed and calming with minty green walls and dark cherry stained chairs The dining room is spacious and can easily accommodate groups of 10 12 Vegetarians if you are feeling unsure about what is in your dish look for the manager owner maybe who seems to be a constant fixture there and who has a complete knowledge of the menu items He ll gladly quell your fears and help you out with trustworthy information 
LimD3cVLYnmaXQ0PzY4xRw CMU Tasty Cantonese food if you know how to order And they have Hong Kong style Barbecued Pork Roast Duck and so on Awesome Another choice for our students is buffet I guess most ppl will go for that 
LO2kVUXK6nYyyGAL3bS-rw CMU I will never again go here I m tired of the lady that always seem pissed off taking my order or making me boba Last time my husband and I went we checked their hours on the door and walked in the door was unlocked The lady yells at us rather rudely DON T YOU SEE LIGHTS OFF First of all the lights were not off It was dim It was our first time going after sunset We thought it was mood lighting Second of all as if the pissed offed service wasn t bad enough we had to be yelled at I never thought their food was that great anyway I ve heard my Chinese friends say that she s nice Well as a non Chinese speaking person I ve only been rudely serviced over and over again Go to Little Asia for Chinese food and LuLu s for boba or walk in if you don t see the old lady working there 
Lo8iBUqgMNZScloiBSes-w CMU If you want to enjoy your time here be sure to ask for the Chinese menu Apparently the restaurant has two types of menu the regular menu where you ll find the standard non spicy dishes and the Chinese menu where you can order from a huge selection of authentic Chinese dishes Pros spacious great for a large group dining quick service tasty food The price is great for the quality of food you get Beware that when they say spicy they really mean it Cons the menu is a little disorganized so be sure to specify clearly what you want instead of mentioning the numbers only Our favorite dishes Congqing chicken eggplant in garlic sauce fish fillet in red pepper 
luMTfANQpZzYEIrk4rSQGQ CMU Went for dim sum on a lazy Sunday The inside of the restaurant is a lot bigger than it appears from the outside There was maybe one other table occupied in the whole place but on to the food the dishes were decent Nothing compared to Chinatown dim sum but tasty I liked that they brought the dim sum choices around on rolling carts too 
LxKGZKhkIkWgSOhVXePm9w CMU One of my great pet peeves about restaurant talk is the pretentious it s not authentic comment I know a high school spanish teacher who is continually sniping at my enthusiasm for a few local Am Mex dives because he s travelled to Mexico and knows what is authentic As far as I see it if it is food you can taste and digest it s authentic Plastic Grapes are not authentic for example Canned ravioli IS authentic Lulu s serves food of Asian origin evolved to reflect the character of the proprietors and staff It is from Pittsburgh not Pyong Pinghu And it s delicious I couldn t give a cat s butt about faithfulness to it s heritage not when I m having little pleasure tremors as each bite of the szechuan bowl s peanutty cilantro goodness hits my tongue I ve never had a bad dish here no one in my family has The soups are fantastic especially the Tom Kha Kai Even the mighty General Tso Emperor of Inauthenticity seems better here My kid loves that stuff and hells bells I m not that proud so do I I always pinch a couple bites and have noted that the chicken here is several steps above the skanky cuts most asian places use no fat clots no gristle and tendons and that s saying something The frozen fruit drinks are fantastic Mango are my favorites The wife and kid 1 had pineapple and watermelon pineapple tasted good but the watermelon tasted just like an acutal watermelon no wow explosion of taste Service was brisk but not brusque Give it a shot You won t be sorry 
L_KkbFuS3IPnfhZXL4pxGg CMU It has good Americanized Chinese food and noodle dishes with a large selection of bubble teas and such Tasty but generic pad thai competent but corporate standard Western style Chinese entrees It s a fun place to come with friends but I wouldn t go out of my way 
mbif8P-4yD7iYDsg7pfP9A CMU The food is decent not great not authentic by any stretch of the imagination but fairly priced for portion size and generally tasty enough I highly recommend the crab rangoon if you like the sweet cream cheesy kind Yum And I like the pad thai even if it is sweet and not authentic as well as the curry chicken FYI My order of the curry chicken and crab rangoon came out to 9 after tax I don t often eat at the restaurant itself I am more a order from wheeldeliver com or pick up person Service isn t great which is probably why I avoid eating in house Bear in mind that parking on the street in the area is generally hard to find unless it is mid day in the middle of the week 
mDJIWCgkGhKwh3Wex7zZhA CMU Quick food Good service My boyfriend will lecture me about leaving tips I WORK IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY I know ALL about leaving good tips 20 every time Maybe even a little extra depending on the service 15 if you truly sucked To Blunt That s my philopshy you get what you work for Long story short he leaves amazing tips and ranted and raved about this place leading us to this review He always says leave an amazing tip they will remember you every time and you ll get amazing service every time Well don t ya know This old Asian women lights up when he comes in He hasn t been there in over a year We order our food he ordered the dumplings and general tso s I ordered the roasted duck and the egg rolls Now I wish I would of gotten what he had their dumplings yes were a little greasy as were the egg rolls but what do you expect It s a chinese buffet His general tso s on the other hand amazing as were the dumplings which reminded me more of pot stickers but any hoo My roasted duck was a little bit of a disappointment I don t mind a few bones but there was bone after bone it was very hard to eat Talk about rustic chinese food I d go back but I wouldn t order the duck dry and no sauce 
mePMfDJEM0DEpAYqmbgSNw CMU My entire notion of Chinese food was imploded and then rebuilt here for the better and grander The flaming fish was the bomb Literally It is not for the timid My mouth was on fire and I will go through that again and again It was that good The other dishes on our table were good but nothing compares Oh order from the Chinese menu General Tso s is not worth it 
MFTdmM0jdYKHYgiTlC3qkA CMU My friend and I decided to try this place ever since it opened and we finally did It was a major disappointment I originally decided to give this place one star which I ve never done on any other restaurants however I changed my mind to 1 5 and rounded up to 2 star thinking I might was being a little too harsh on it I had a salad which I do not remember the name of but it sucked Looking out the window and seeing Panera across the street I couldn t help but only comparing these 2 places My friend ordered some kind of pan fried noodle and it was pan burnt I never will go back to this place to eat 
mJaUkaEnB5g0_1P3VnFUZw CMU Sorry guy everyone I know loves this place Sure there are a few things I didn t like but most are tasty fresh and not at all as greasy or too saucy like lots of Chinese takeout Highlights include the Lard Nar Pork Hong Kong Chow Fun Beef almost any noodle bowl the Teriyaki Chicken Salad And the gyoza appetizer so yummy As a group me and my coworkers like to hit it once a month For those who might peruse the menu Yum Wok is the more mainstream Chinese menu LuLu s Noodles being a collection of different Asian noodle dishes update When I wrote this there was only maybe one other review I hear you guys Yeah don t get the stuff that s not Chinese You are NOT going to get good or authentic pad thai or teriyaki chicken or udon You will usually get tasty not overly greasy Americanized Chinese food Although the gyoza is very very good 
mMhOrabtmcN08QmVJHhEiQ CMU Okay for what Szechuan Express is it succeeds I m giving it four stars because I like cheap greasy Chinese food and this was my favorite place for it as a Pitt undergrad I go back every time I m in Oakland and I get the tofu and broccoli with garlic sauce and I am content Yes it s a ton and a half of rice but the sauce is delicious and you get plenty of tofu and broccoli for you know a week Food comes quickly and it s always hot There s a cooler with cans and bottles of everything there s plenty of seating and the same dependable crappy music is always playing And for all these bad reviews there are always people there Like I said whenever I visit Pgh I stop at Szechuan Express for a solid block of Chinese food 
mnezNwOtFH2Wb6hY-gwXOg CMU Lulu s is mediocre at best I never understood why the place is always so crowded when there are so many better alternatives on that street like little asia Every time I ve eaten there it s been a bit of a disappointment and never a memorable thing The only semi redeeming quality of this place is that the bubble tea is pretty good 
MNNnxBeQ9HTqjT0CEQvszQ CMU Their food continues to disappoint I m never sure what I m getting because I never get what I order it s always a mystery meal here Last time and probably my last time eating here I got chow mein but it came in 2 different containers was soupy and full of celery and there were no noodles And now that it s winter it s extremely cold inside And dark Also they have a 10 minumim on cards 
MP8x_Fd5OU5WwQ-V6X6qAg CMU Quiet place good sushi not a great atmosphere not crowded suishi not rolled very tight but I will go back 
MQwn9b8aciCxXLrsWU_oOA CMU Our lunch tasted great the service was fast but Our waitress was obnoxious The major issue I had was that my friend clearly and concisely stated that she was allergic to fish and had a seafood allergy She ordered a benot box and was subsequently served crab and shrimp tempura She told the waitress she would become ill and the waitress started mumbling complaining and just walked away She came back a few minutes and asked how was everything and my friend explained her allergy the waitress started arguing saying she knows the menu and fish is not seafood We were polite throughout and i just asked for the menu so my friend could order something else Then she said i will change to vegetarian Entertaining but strange Not to mention prior to the strange fish incident the waitress raised her voice and scolded a two year old for using chopsticks as drum sticks At the time there weren t other patrons in the room The noise was only mildly annoying and she only made the noise for about 20 seconds I was re directing when the waitress pretty much yelled at my child That being said unlike many moms I sincerely encourage other adults to reprimand my child so the reprimand would have been welcome had it been either polite or professional The booster seats hadn t been cleaned from prior use This was the first time in my life that I considered not tipping but we decided to tip regardless of the obnoxious attitude I really loved the Chinese broccoli at this place but I won t return after this embarrassing service Also the food was brought back on the same plate if my friend had a more serious allergy the contamination could have made her sick Luckily her throat doesn t close up it just gets itchy when she has seafood The waitress kept calling us lady in a most obnoxious tone it was a strange lunch She was so unbelievably rude it was entertaining She was quite nice to the business men who came in when we were about to leave I am not sure what her issue was but I won t be back to find out 
mT0HZ5QBovmqhm3qcxVD4A CMU This place is nasty I seriously don t understand why anyone would like this place Even for Americanized Chinese standards there are still better options Bubble Tea Flavored with Corn Syrup can t you tell I can when I unwittingly bought a Strawberry and Mango for a friend it was so artificially sweet it burned my throat Definitely not good bubble tea And definitely not worth the price Donated to some drunk friends who could stand drinking it Food Lucky me got suckered into someone s birthday dinner here Being their birthday I had to go and pretend to enjoy it Had I known we were going here my skeptical experience over the bubble tea would have made me formulate a dramatic excuse I ordered a noodle dish and a tofu dish for the table ma po tofu I believe Noodles were very dry And tasteless And they re known for their noodles That just makes me incredibly sad Nothing good to say about the tofu If you want good tofu go to Little Asia across the street No comparison Service All the ladies here are impossible to flag down Bad service is staple to a good Chinese place quite frankly but if someone is waving their hand wildly for the bill for half an hour Well that s why this place is so seemingly crowded all the time Better to just get up and fetch it yourself from the counter btw Don t be fooled this place is baAAAAaaaaAAd Here are some local alternatives Rose Tea Cafe Little Asia KaMei If this review hurt the feeling of some local fans take a vacation to SF LA or NYC Flushing sometime you will understand the 1 and 2 starred reviewers pains 
MUE6DSJgYkETYYfEo3RIWA CMU We ordered at 5 31p m The driver showed up t 9 16p m the food was cold the manager lied to me twice about how long it was going to take and then insisted we pay I shoved the food back and told them to stuff it 
MXgCAmPne5CL_DP6XV0zIQ CMU The place is not the best but has a few delicacies that are quite tasty However the food takes a while to make Great for big parties and for small events Also great for regular occasions Overall restaurant is not the best Asian restaurant I have been to but it is enough to fill my stomach 
NAwfzm8cQF5e3PcaU0lMNA CMU Is what it is Better fresher cheaper and more filling then any fast Asian based food place Not authentic but it s not the type of place to go where you expect authentic so all in all I do indeed like it 
NBdeIaIk-3-i6e7AOZ6rWg CMU I think that this is the closest off campus restaurant to CMU The price is fine and you get a large amount of food The service here is quick and efficient but no one is very friendly That s fine as I hardly ever eat in and only stop by to pick up a meal Their bubble tea is pretty good I especially recommend the mango bubble tea Also the chow fun is pretty good as well Overall the food is tasty the service is quick and the price is alright Not bad for a conveniently close restaurant 
NFZVymTt0_32aDEuzgqpkw CMU I will say this is as good as it gets for vegetarian Chinese food Plus they deliver to my apartment I got the Kong Pao Wheat Gluten Veggie Lo mein It wasn t excessively spicy but enough to make it flavorful I ordered this for myself I had a HUGE plate of both with some white rice a spring roll I literally still have enough for 2 more meals With a total of 22 50 it was the best quick tasty Sunday dinner for a non meat eater 
NjFbOuyqEKX2pIV4EmtyJA CMU Maybe I m spoiled living in Asian noodle heaven northern California but the food here didn t cut it for me I got the Lard Nar BBQ Pork which was too sweet and tasted like MSG The texture of the noodles was all right slightly chewy and moderately dense My friend s kimchi fried rice looked like regular fried rice with maybe three pieces of kimchi a travesty to my Korean senses This restaurant s saving grace is the reasonable price range which is probably why it s so crowded all the time If I were a hungry CMU or U of Pittsburgh student craving Asian food I d probably come here regularly but otherwise I wouldn t go out of my way to eat here 
NRI9T-4CNIWfT6oz017lBg CMU Let me say up front that my food was great so the missing two stars have little to do with that Pacific Ring did they mean Pacific Rim is an attempt to do Japanese and Chinese simultaneously with some Thai thrown in for good measure The bad news Not the worst idea in the world but as often happens with that strategy the menu is way way way too long It worries me when menus are that long at an independently owned operation like this because the odds that the hundreds of ingredients necessary to cover all the dishes are fresh and at their best every day are slim to none As a vegetarian I m slightly less concerned since I m not spending top dollar on what may not be the freshest fish or beef or chicken But I still care about my carnivorous friends Also while some of the Japanese salads and noodle dishes seem fine they re attempting sushi too which makes little sense If I want to consume raw fish I m going to go somewhere which sole laser like focus is on the preparation of raw fish Especially if I m in an inland city like Pittsburgh At Pacific Ring sushi seems completely out of place Like the menu the place is just too big Granted I ate there on a Tuesday evening during Pittsburgh s worst snowfall in decades But restaurants are always going to have more slow going weekday evenings and it s just not good advertising to be serving diners in a huge fairly empty restaurant Better to err on the side of small and pack them in every night I think The good news My ma po tofu was excellent Without requesting it my tofu was steamed not fried Very little grease in either that or my hot sour soup There is likely some MSG here but I m sure they d leave it out if asked The waitstaff was prompt and friendly Despite the size of the place the design is pleasing and the lighting is good Great location along the Murray strip in Squirrel Hill N And the prices are for the most part very reasonable I would eat here again but I d be weary of meat seafood items and I m not sure that I d invite anyone but close friends who don t need to be impressed to dine with me 
NrTMbS_tA6aYcFc7F4Ve2w CMU I ve lived in Pittsburgh for 7 years and I have been very dissapointed overall with the options for chinese food If you re looking for an authentic chinese food place that has all the options chinese green veggies are my fav look no further Great place My only complaint is that they stopped offering brown rice recently 
nY30JuCxvIdg9q5GyC_bEA CMU Lulus Noodles is a great place to eat with good quick food The staff especially Anetti is extremely friendly and will welcome you by name if you are a frequent visitor Hands down their bubble tea smoothies are the best i have ever had I ve had quite a few in the area and various cities and theirs is still my favorite 
o0NzEEuX2S2Q3yTMsI-qow CMU A Korean Chinese joint Recommended by one of my profs Also one of the dirtiest places I ve gone to in the burgh One of those places where you stack napkins on top of each other cause the one on the bottom might be stuck to the table Pretty unremarkable below average food too Needless to say I didn t take any more restaurant recommendations from my prof 
O5adkT5Nze6YTwlCvq2TVw CMU I ve never really had authentic chinese food and I m as guilty as they come as far as loving my americanized general tso s and egg rolls However authentic Sichuan with it s allure of numbing spiciness has had me wanting to try it out for a while now So while we waited for our one hour photos to finish at Costco we ran up here to give this place a shot We walked in to grab takeout and the guy at the front desk seemed American born and fluent in both English and Mandarin Not that I know what fluent Mandarin sounds like mind you so consider your complicated phone orders A OK with this place We started to look at the menu and were disappointed at the choices it seemed to be a normal chinese place with a few additions here and there As I was about to choose a dish though the guy mentions that there are in fact two different menus and that if we re feeling adventurous we should look off the black menu Of course this is what I had been looking for and of course it was no easier to make a selection off the hundred or so brief descriptions I finally asked the guy what would give me my fix of Sichuan heat and he immediately recommended the Chongqing Chicken 12 95 describing it at simply chicken mixed in with a heaping pile of peppers sounded right up my alley My friend got Shredded Potato in a spicy sauce 9 95 and my girlfriend got tofu noodle soup 7 95 which they accommodated her complicated order of no sesame oil sesame seeds or nuts by going back to the kitchen and ensuring it could be done first Our food was ready in about 10 minutes When I finally got around to eating the chicken it was exactly as I had hoped peppers outnumbered chicken in this dish by far and the heat was amazing Pure mouth numbing bliss and the flavors of the dish itself were outstanding But seriously the heat was what I was after and the heat I got and as I took breaks from eating I was sweating and my tongue felt like it got shot up with novocain The shredded potato dish was fairly tasty for the little I tried and the tofu noodle soup was a bit bland in my opinion by we also ordered it with a water base instead of a chicken stock base which is probably the reason The China Star is an awesome place to go try out some real Chinese food I don t know if this place will replace my General Tso s habits but I can t wait to come back and start to work my way through some more items on this menu 
o5CEM3RTLvtd7ht7tFSydQ CMU Was walking around Oakland and wanted a quick meal saw a lot of people inside Turns out to be a favorite with Pitt students because it s cheap with big servings Food was just ok for asian 
o68Jps8mqjS_R4lPzNylAA CMU Was there at a busy time Mother s Day dinner and the service was poor with a waitress who did not ask specifics and was slow to deliver things like hot mustard and kept us waiting for our order for over an hour Not all her fault And the food was ordinary Not bad a little tasteless but why bother 
O8y1wCfb8Ub9N-VOad_HDA CMU Food is kinda tired but not as tired as the people that work there Everyone who works here has soo much attitude its beyond belief 1 Get over yourself 2 The pho is horrible 3 Horrible Horrible music Life is too short to be rude all the time I actually stopped going there because everyone who works there is sooo rude all I order is takeout 
oAMoTFnbPipQrEuqRchSnA CMU My favorite chinese place of all time GOd i miss this place my favorite place to go when i was in college Good price good portion perfectly flavored not too sweet greasy Would love to stop by someday soon 
odq-WOwP1lnZRdy8bEF9Ww CMU Fast and cheap not a big fan of the food here but pretty good value for money I really like the curry scallion pancake though can t get enough of those Not the best place for asian food near CMU that would be lulu s but a pretty nice place to come once in a while Seating is nice so good place to catch up with a friend 
oJwtirrBaXgiIkhEz_WqEw CMU Was craving some Pho today Being a Pho lover and having ate quite a bit of Pho in my lifetime I must say the Pho was terrible The Pho soup did not have the great beef flavor that is essential in every bowl of Pho They did not put a lemon on the side and the beef in the bowl was already cooked and coated with some sort of slimy substance that made the meat more tender My friend ordered the Szechuan noodle bowl and I had a bite of it and I must say it was much better That being said the Gyoza dumplings weren t that bad As for service there was none unfortunately We had to wait for one of the staff members to clean the table next to us so we could get their attention for some more water and napkins Very sub par experience but I will definitely return to give this place another shot I will give it another review in the future 
oKq8o2piPdqgYWPLla6ZDw CMU I m not planning on being overly elaborate in my praise but this was seriously the best chinese food I have ever had I wasn t even particularly in the mood for chinese but my brother was in town and was craving some This was the first time yelp played a role in my choice and I am so glad I listened to the reviews I m pretty sure I have finally found the chinese place to go to in Pittsburgh 
ONP81zXiPqYn_xNgC7NUTg CMU Lowest in my rankings for Chinese food on Craig street Go to Little Asia or Orient express MUCH better than Lulu s 
OOdLBXP2mANP9AGBpCUmkg CMU It s ok though a bit greasier than I d prefer I usually order take out Beef Chow Fun which comes in an aluminum tray and I swear the grease seems to leak through the aluminum to the outside of the tray too which isn t even possible It s not any cheaper than LuLu s but they do seem a lot faster As for the bubble tea I tried one of the less popular flavors my first time there either red bean or taro and it tasted exactly like that dental office latex glove smell Definitely stick with the normal flavors or get your bubble tea from LuLu s 
oQZ63oa8Mb08PyOt5RKRLw CMU To be honest Lulu does not deserve any stars The food here is mediocre at best The food is either too bland or overly salty The waiters waitress here have an attitude and are very impolite Sometimes they forget to bring utensils napkins or plates One time they pretty much forgot to bring me my food It also takes me a lot of effort for a waiter waitress to pour me water every time The cashier yelled at me once for using a credit card It might just be my personal opinion but I feel like the staffs are nicer to white customers than Asian customers Also Rose Tea Cafe has the best bubble tea in Pittsburgh not Lulu s 
OS3e5zG6Qk4ogpQ3-EMxaw CMU I think the trick to getting non chunky taro bubble tea here is to request it as a smoothie which not surprisingly means upping the price If you re in Oakland and in the mood for some greasy noodles sometimes I actually am Lulu s can be all right The menu is pretty clear on which dishes can be made vegetarian which I appreciated I don t really expect authenticity with a Pan Asian place so I d go with dishes that are less traditional like the chow fun or the pan fried noodles Big portions pretty fast Don t think I need to mention the service here other people have covered that It d be nice though if when you ordered the taro bubble tea non smoothie that they d warn you that the drink came with taro bits I ve never had a taro bubble tea anywhere else that wasn t smooth other than the boba But I guess I shouldn t expect that given the general quality of service here 
OscNZlQSF5WEM1Xd7c3Ldw CMU Inedible General Tso chicken I will never go back here 
ottEzqYIb8Btx9W1EKeAuA CMU I live a couple minutes walk from this place so I find myself coming here for lunch or dinner often when I m in the mood for Chinese food The servers are nice and good service is always important to me I haven t tried many of their dishes as I always tend to order the same dishes but its a good place for Chinese food in shadyside The lunch specials are a great deal and I do like the interior of the restaurant It s pretty much straight forward American Chinese food not amazingly authentic or true to actual Chinese cuisine but good enough for our western taste buds 
ou1EWDUwLW7zlTekDyrR1w CMU This place deserves 5 stars because it is some of the best food you can get for your money and because they mean it when they say express I have tried many things from this restaurant and my top favorites are the Singapore Rice Noodles Hunan Chicken and ANYTHING tofu I m a really big fan of their fried tofu in general but when served in the orange or the spicy General Tsos variety I am the happiest of girls Though a friend from work avoids the lunch specials because she doesn t like the egg rolls it is a staple in my order always I recommend this venue if you are looking for good food and value over a lunch break 
ou_XhsvBnvHZuUdFASOCZQ CMU Lulu s has great american asian food It bring lots of great dishes from many cultures The plates are large but still priced for single persons So you don t have to share a dish ever The Dr Foo s Special is a really awesome popular dish I get it about every time I go You have to mix in the Dr Foo s Special sauce The Pad Thai and the Spicy Sechewan are good dishes too Their appetizers are good and cheap too I would recommend going here over Oriental Express every day unless you are in a hurry Lulu s service can be horrible sometimes Once the waitress didn t realize she was our waitress and left us sitting there for 15 minutes Lulu s does have the best bubble tea in Pittsburgh though I like Classic the most But I figured out the smoothies are the best bang for your buck because they aren t 50 ice like the bubble teas sometimes are I usually spend 12 on meal bubble tea tip and tax 
P7TYXw-qi9tjEcREhbi9lQ CMU These 5 stars are for the crab rangoon which is the only thing I ve ever eaten on the menu Yup It s that good 
P9HCkvKtGmyJw_0hc1-7NA CMU Giving it another star The honey chicken has to be the best tasting fried chicken I ve ever had I m also in love with the beef chow fun I m definitely coming back to try out other dishes This place won t ever get 5 stars from me though I went back a few times and one time I remember the place being horrible messy Granted it was a bit busy but having food all over the floor isn t acceptable A group of people got placed at a table with bunch of food on the ground They reluctantly sat there I definitely know I wouldn t have 
PA8vitCRqw2K3i4xWtDJZQ CMU Firstly I have to say that I judge Chinese food very harshly It has to be wonderful for me to say that it is pretty good Unfortunately this really is not one of those places that I can be happy to say has good food My first warning sign was when my department head took us here for a lunch meeting because he wanted a quiet place to be able to hear one another He was right it was very quiet because there was no one there for lunch except for a group of 6 of us The food was an impressive at all I ordered a stirred fried rice noodle and it was definitely too salty and sour My colleague s fried rice and egg rolled did not look any better It was overwhelmingly brown which tells me that they soy sauce was the main ingredient I do not recommend this place to find great Chinese food 
PerEAhcjGHH2JyEuxB__oA CMU Service I wasn t sure about LuLu s when I arrived The hostess was impatient and raised her voice when inquiring if we wanted a table even after we have confirmed that we did We were seated promptly and provided with utensils and waters with our orders taken pretty quickly afterwards We waited a while for the bill which took multiple promptings but eventually were able to pay and leave Although it was good for a quick meal it was not a particularly satisfying dining experience Food It was a skeptical moment to see such a wide variety of dishes at such low prices because quality becomes a factor dishes between 6 8 Skepticism was confirmed when the meals arrived I ordered the Thai Curry Chicken and was not particularly impressed with the dish It had the richness from the coconut milk but it was a bit too sweet and the green beans tasted strange as if old and past its freshness date Onions were undercooked and chopped too largely that it conflicted with the texture of the dish All in all it was way off the mark My brother ordered an udon dish with beef but I was surprised to see that they added ground beef bits in it instead of slices which to me communicated poor attention to details and choice of ingredients Atmosphere Very loud and chattery Great for college students large groups and families but definitely not for a first date sort of deal or for lunch meetings much too loud Fake Asian decor and some aspects of the upkeep of the place were questionable peeling wallpaper covered with plexi glass bolted to it 
PErqoycwuBdgX2CdeNne2g CMU Definitely a fan of Lulu s First time there we ended up ordering the Pan Fried Noodles with shrimp deeelicious hot and sour soup really terrific a pork dish decent and some other noodle dish with peanut sauce and chicken very good Coconut bubble tea rocked 
PhpoIkulxe6W_Sz7hVBSGQ CMU Having recently gained immunity to unsatisfactory dining experiences in general from brusque service to insipid cooking I was pleasantly surprised by Pacific Ring s PR cordial atmosphere PR definitely called upon my broken Chinese and my rusty Chinese character reading all thanks to having taken the language back in college but once the servers realized that my language skills was passable they happily conversed in the central China dialect Not remembering the last time I had dim sum I swung by on a Saturday afternoon only to find the place quite empty Once I have my mind set on something nothing deters me so I unhesitantly opted for the ju hua cha chrysanthemum tea before attacking the dim sum carts My minor complaint was that while every dish was bursting with flavor and not too greasy everything was lukewarm With the exception of the red bean milk coconut cake which could use a bit more sugar however everything was delightful The house pan fried noodles were a tad salty but nothing that a couple cups of tea and a bowl of rice can t solve Service was top notch and quite the welcoming change Refills were met and each dish was cleared literally as I took the last bite Needless to say I ll be venturing back the next time I m in the area to sample the rest of the menu 
PjEIIoYygQnU0PfYrfUX7g CMU I went again last night and tried one of their noodle dishes with BBQ pork I don t know what it is that always mysteriously attracts me to BBQ pork these days even at places where they re not even tasty The noodle dish was still mediocre but as promised i tried out one of their drinks I ordered the mango smoothie and wanted to put boba in there but they had run out for the evening they offered jelly instead and it was actually pleasantly surprising So tasty that I actually decided that I ll be ordering jelly from now on the jelly they use are assorted types of jelly including almond a few other ones colored clear red etc this will most likely remain a staple chinese joint for me given its location and good drinks Perfect for an 85 degree day like today 
PnN80p0PDEa3Qt4UpFqoiA CMU good food large quantities if you like spicy food ask for the cs16 very spicy sichuan dish will make the same dish with shrimp for an extra charge friendly service for a chinese restaurant 
Pp5RwVPBLXd7jGsDysEPAA CMU Actually one star is still too high to them I would be to give zero star if applicable First of all their service is very awful Every time I went there I felt bad All the servers in there are very unkind and never smile to their customers If I want to ask something I have to call them at least three times When there is miscommunication or they couldn t understand what I said they yelled at me I had been there five years ago and due to the disappointing services and because we found dead fly in my friend s dish and didn t apologize for that when we complained about that nasty fly I didn t go back However today I was starving and want to have Pat Thai so bad I couldn t find anywhere else Little Asia didn t accept credit card under 10 Therefore I went there and I realized that there is nothing changed To me it is amazing that they re still running their business In addition food is not that impressive to endure their awful service Until other people have different kind of Pat Thai I didn t know that there is another option I can choose I won t go back this restaurant never again To summery very awful and unkind service and unimpressive food Highly un recommendable 
PRdEPP39cSyAQnXizcNPpw CMU Stumbled on this place while wandering around the CMU campus An odd location but the lunch was quite delicious with large and perfectly cooked veggies and meat service was quick and my lunch was a mere 6 What is not to love 
PS2elA0_w5HmZi1cMn2llw CMU Worse chinese ive ever had and the owner is miserable I have never in my life sent a plate back I would rather eat something I hate then send it back However the food was so bad that for the first time in my life I did I ordered the family style tofu The veggies were cold and the tofu had never touched a pan The tofu was so watery it had not been pressed it has not been fried it had just been cut and put on my plate It had not even been seasoned It was just soy mush BEFORE I was going to break my own rule I asked each person at my table familar with the dish from other places to try it ALL OF THEM said it was wrong gross cold horrible So I finally asked the lady if they could help me THE OWNER YELLED AT ME It is fried that is fried I said I am sorry but it is cold She said fine I will take it and cook it better I know better then to have someone threaten me and then give them food to give back to me I actually don t believe people spit on food but for the first time in my life I didn t trust my waiter or the owner She was mean and rude So she said what do i want then I guess you want some free food then SHE SAID THAT TO ME No i already paid for that so I want something to eat Nothing has been free She handed me a menu and hovered over me for the entire time and finally in a rush I just picked an appetizer Because I had already picked what i wanted but it was horrible THEY CHARGED ME FOR THE MEAL NOT THE APPETIZER a big price difference I am a very shy person and being verbally attacked as a customer was crossing the line I will never go back and I always tell my friends to avoid it As you can see from my reviews I NEVER rate things badly I have decided a long time ago to come on here and help restaurants that I want to do well when they really do something well get good reviews I keep my mouth shut if i actually don t like a place I might have ordered badly I might have misunderstood something I am not going to put anyone out of business but this place I hate it Wish it would close 
ptNomldecxHmybtQZw3Q5A CMU If you re looking for the gourmet experience of a lifetime this is totally not the place But if you want fast cheap Asian food that is pretty good and smells great OE is perfect It s also conveniently close to CMU so perfect for lunch breaks Also their bubble tea is way better than Lulu s Just putting that out there 
pURIoRdXrQfF-_Z61T7v-w CMU Year in and year out this is the best asian food restaurant in Pittsburgh It s not fancy the decor is a bit tired and dusty and the food is dressed and presented with bells and whistles but it s damn good food at a very fair price The food is fresh done well and flavorful Another diner noted that there never seems to be more than two or three other tables of diners in the restaurant That s true but there s a steady flow of carry out and delivery food And for dessert hop next to the ice cream shop 
PWmaXFJTr5L_VitMGFAJcg CMU They changed the name but kept the deliciousness Sichuan Gourmet formerly China Star offers authentic and dishes in addition to the American hybrids most locals think of as Chinese food The spicy Sichuan pantheon nicely complements what I grew up thinking of as the classics so Sichuan Gourmet is a top tier choice for any type of Chinese meal Favorites on the authentic side include chengdu style diced chicken with dry peppers sauteed with hot peppers oil and some amazing spices and the double cooked sliced pork belly a more unusual almost woodsy taste for some American palates but this thin sliced meat with green peppers has never disappointed Excellent dishes that might look more familiar include cumin lamb which is particularly good here and the also excellent Singapore style curried rice noodles The worst part of a trip here is choosing Do I pick an old favorite or try something new from the extensive menu Do I go Sichuan style today or opt for a more American taste Do I share with the table or horde my precious preferred delicacy all for myself These are real dilemmas which deserve careful deliberation before a trip personally I like to go with a group and share so we can order all kinds of cuisine and try new things in addition to old standbys Another drawback might be the servers Occasionally you ll get an off day on the service side and more often than that there may be some language barriers if you re like me and don t speak Chinese But don t let that stand in the way of a fantastic culinary experience that seems to be truly unique in Pittsburgh Bottom line Great quality and recipes make this establishment a taste leader among Pittsburgh Chinese restaurants and it s certainly worth a detour or a special trip In fact I ll go out on a limb right now and declare this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in all of Allegheny County 
pXe0irkUX3cgpevLOjX3Pg CMU This place looks like your standard hole in the wall Americanized Chinese food restaurant The difference being that the food here is inedible Vegetable dumplings taste like they are full of grass homestyle tofu looked very old I get that they are trying to fill the niche of guilty pleasure fast n dirty Chinese food a la Szechuan Express in Oakland but there is no pleasure to be found here 
PyWb5NRpE8vNkpaS7ccTqQ CMU After four years at CMU this is one restaurant that I m not going to miss Their food is mediocre usually covered in sauce and the wait staff always seem unfriendly However one upside is that they bring the food out very quickly usually within 5 10 minutes of ordering so we just guessed that they have all the ingredients ready on hand and then when an order comes it just put it in the wok and saute away Their bubble tea isn t very good here because 1 it s made from powder mix and 2 their bubbles boba are soooo hard I think they never defrost the tapioca or something Bleh A good place to go for quick cheap eats especially if you re a Pitt CMU student but if you want quality food definitely go somewhere else 
PzKIov6zKLmQVJLzAtqD4Q CMU This place has been a staple in my life ever since I moved to the city To the untrained eye the menu looks fairly simple standard chinese favorites a basic sushi menu no big deal right Wrong This is as close as you re going to get to authentic Chinese in the city Fresh seafood a rarity for Pburgh traditional dishes on a rotating specials menu and amazing hot pots are what you can expect to find I recently tried the basil chicken with crispy milk and I m addicted Sweet slightly crunchy milk balls paired with a flavorful brown sauce and crunchy sauteed basil are an unexpected match made in heaven It s not on their everyday menu but it s always worth asking if they re able to make it this place is great for off the menu offerings if you know what you re asking for If you re a veggie lover or even on the fence the buddah wrapped vegetables are a must An assortment of crunchy Chinese veggies are baked in tofu skin and doused with a rich dark sauce its unlike anything I ve had before So good And I kind of hate meatless dishes The hot pots are are always a sure bet The pork fish and tofu with veggies may sound like a mismatched assortment of whatever but they work their magic Oh yes they work their magic It s my favorite but that being said you can t go wrong with any of their hot pot offerings Shit is dope I could go on and on about all the amazing things Orient Kitchen has to offer but they re open till 11 most nights so you re better off figuring it out for yourself 
pzXRGYOtO4VdS5E4aBS_1g CMU I m not a meat eater so I couldn t care too much that some of their authentic dishes are a revelation to those who have had crummy Asian food in Pittsburgh There are a few veg friendly dishes but the samaritan in me after 2 visits at this place should warn vegetarians vegans of the following Under Small Eats the Tan Tan Noodles and anything that s hot and sour will be drowning in chili oil The whole dish will just look like a swamp of red orange sauce oil that anyone would be scared to ingest in anything more than a light coating on the edible parts Do the Chinese really eat such abhorrently greasy dishes Oh and these dishes aren t small at all make sure you share with at least one other Casserole Casserole with cabbage and gingko nuts Mild but good flavor and lots of veggies I would suggest to round out a meat centric meal with this instead of the many other tofu dishes as if vegetarians only eat tofu for protein Sichuan Specialties Giant mushroom w basil and diced taro Some of the mushrooms tasted too medicinal for me but a very meaty dish all things considered and its sauce goes well with white rice Both entrees are huge portions so again I advise sharing because anything that s not Americanized Chinese fare will be in this size aka for family style Be adventurous with friends and enjoy 
q-8MptANhRd41SFPygLqxQ CMU Lulu is average Some good dishes some mediocre ones They have a wide range of dishes to suit every diet and taste Personally I think the Orient Express next door is a better value and tastier but Lulu s is a decent and reasonably priced little college noodle hut 
Q4NI5tTkgVkaRyRk-93OJQ CMU Meh Their tapioca is okay Their general tso s chicken is okay Their pho is terrible They don t even have hoisin sauce sprouts mint limes or anything else They also used the wrong noodles in the tasteless broth Sighs Edit Tried Lulu s again I ve decided that I m not coming back anymore and I ll never understand why it s so packed all the time I got the Pad Thai and the Thai Curry The Thai Curry was okay but the Pad Thai was the grossest thing I have ever seen It looked like someone had vomited it out plated it and then served The noodles were over cooked and floated in a bath of sweet syrupy soup Yeah Gross 
q6zxhi-BFUFjWbSV1JW7bA CMU I ate here for lunch with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was The service was very fast and friendly and the prices were reasonable It will now be my go to Chinese place for lunch 
Q9EMZfKM-GuNQ8J6bWOAWQ CMU In sum we ordered take out here a few days ago There were bugs in my egg drop soup Nuff said Usually I write these long reviews Not today I ordered two orders of soup Hot and Sour and Egg Drop I only eat the Hot and Sour the night we ordered our take out I specifically ordered the Egg Drop to have for lunch yesterday Fortunately for me I noticed the bugs prior to eating Looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup Disgusting 
Qc40ic3hCLGvLOxCqlVPJQ CMU A good place to go to for more authentic Chinese Cantonese food All of the staff are Cantonese I believe This place is decently sized and it has a drink menu and a sushi menu And thank goodness there is a small parking lot because we all know that parking is very very sacred in the area around CMU Pitt My favorite dish Their Bok Choy or bai cai is amazing Seasoned just the right amount neither too salty or too bland It s oily but not dripping with oil I love it I could eat a whole plate of this The duck is pretty decent too although it s a bit high on price about 17 for half a duck 22 for a whole duck But the taste may be well worth it because I haven t really gotten this style of duck anywhere else in Pittsburgh Some of the dishes are questionable they look more like American Chinese style dripping with strange orange red brown sauce but there aren t too many of these Recommended for people craving more authentic Chinese food in Pittsburgh and we all know how hard that can be to find 
qDbbv1l_zT0iZh-6lFTj0w CMU The waitress owner is the worst I have ever experienced Sure her English is bad but her attitude is worse I went in with allergies a cold after 3pm yesterday evening hoping to get a soup to comfort me She tossed the menus on the table remarking that she was doing me a favor by placing the lunch menu on the table even when lunch was technically over She went away and chatted in Chinese with the nearby table She came back to my table and I wasn t ready It took her 10 minutes to return She turned up her nose at me and began chatting loudly with the sushi chef My body language showed I was ready but she came over when she was good and ready I said that I wanted soup and asked her for her recommendation since I was feeling under the weather I guess she was disappointed in my order She refused to apply herself to the question giving short sharp answers avoiding eye contact and then stating Everyone is different so a recommendation was not possible She left again for an extended period of time I had time to look around at the dirty carpet She brought no tea or water I asked about the spring rolls were they fried She tried to educate me on Chinese cuisine versus Thai with such attitude Excuse me I thought to myself Does Orient equate with Chinese I asked if she had ginger tea She said there was only one tea in a yelling tone and I had better be okay with that Finally I ordered the Miso soup It came in a very small bowl and was not hot enough I asked for the tea twice since it appeared she did not hear me She barked at me with the equivalent Alright already She plopped it on the table Later when I was finished with my soup she put her fingers all over the tea nossle That was effective in making me leave promptly Again my body language communicated Check please but she chatted with the sushi chef never letting him get a word in edgewise I waited another agonizing 5 minutes for the check and left a 1cent tip I mumbled Never again as I left determined to never frequent this establishment and to discourage all of my friends and family to steer clear As I drove around the back the kitchen staff stared at me in an unwelcoming manner I had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before 
qdvDqZcEHXla8mWmPCVJZg CMU I used to eat dim sum in New York s Chinatown and in heavily Chinese neighborhoods in Queens NY so I have pretty high expectations This place can t compare with my old haunts But based on the fairly positive reactions of my friends who aren t as familiar with dim sum this place is okay by Pittsburgh standards The dumpling wrappers on the vegetable dumplings were gummy and popped right open when I picked the dumplings up The rice crepes were also a little too jelly like in texture I don t recommend the cilantro crepe even if you like cilantro The crispy crullers are a little better because the the crispness of the cruller contrasts with the gummy rice crepe wrapper but you re better off just picking off the rice crepe and eating the cruller middle My friends especially loved the Shanghai pork dumplings and sticky rice dumplings with chicken I couldn t eat those but if you can they might be your best bets The egg custard tarts were decent and a nice way to conclude the meal The tea unfortunately appears to come from tea bags and not loose tea leaves Dim sum cart service is only on weekends What s more confusing is that only some items are brought around on the cart while other items must be ordered I do miss seeing what all my food options look like before committing to anything The service here is pretty pleasant though which is a surprise when it comes to getting dim sum 
qITPI0NphvebI5FL8cYU_Q CMU Quick Service and you get a large quantity of food I wish the lady behind the counter didn t have such a bad attitude General tso tofu 4 life 
QjGUiXXX7xQ4O7e6aP4tuA CMU This is my go to spot for Chinese food in Oakland They have an extensive menu as does the other local Chinese restaurants but the kicker is that Tong s uses the meat that you order that is if you order chicken then you get chicken not cat dog or pigeon In all seriousness in a highly competitive market where students are demanding quick preparation times Tong s does an excellent job of balancing quality and preparation time 
qj_-cg5Fy59usrOES5korQ CMU The price is fine pretty mediocre though as far as cheap chinese buffets go The eggrolls were undercooked 
QmG5IGz4seHcqRCQzefQVg CMU I was not sorry to see Pacific Ring go and so was excited to try a new restaurant All I can say is wow We ordered off of the authentic Chinese menu and really enjoyed our choices My husband had the beef soup which was very flavorful and a huge serving I ordered a dish with fish and tofu in a spicy sauce Yummy yummy yummy I also had a cold beef tripe appetizer Also very good As we live around the corner we will definitely be working our way through the menu on a regular basis 
qq_rLTChQ5jpGdXlVcyP0A CMU The worst pad Thai noodles ever It is not suppose to taste sweet I had plaque build up immediately on my teeth Worst than eating a bag of candy 
qsaOOfxZHnwZzVJTTCJwNw CMU I only go to two Chinese restaurants in Pgh and this is one of them They offer an impressive Vegetarian Menu with soy protein wheat gluten and tofu They have a nice lunch special too that features several dishes from their regular veg menu including vegetarian hot and sour soup The atmosphere is nice and the place looks much nicer inside than you would expect from the outside The waitstaff is both nice and attentive and because I eat here a lot they remember me My boyfriend is neither vegan nor vegetarian but almost always orders soy protein his favorite is the Orange Soy Protein I recommend the Kung Pao Soy Protein for lunch and Shredded Heaven for dinner Seriously you need to try the Shredded Heaven It s comprised of wheat gluten seitan tofu bamboo shoots and an assortment of other awesome things 
qugOhm1dzuTSRb_Xv_zstQ CMU Best strawberry bubble drinks smoothies or teas I ve ever had hands down no question And I ve had a lot Other than that the dishes are delish the portions are huge and the menu has a great variety Yes the food is a little greasy but thus very tasty and the service is hit or miss Still for those of us who were are students in the Oakland area Lulu s is a beloved staple 
Qun9LDH_yFG1BQcr6FtX2g CMU My mom from Taiwan who has been in the hospital for a week had a craving for outside food yesterday so she sent me to Szechuan Express for the Roast Duck Noodle soup A bit surprised they used rice noodle but my mom loved it For less than 6 two containers quart and a half of soup that really tasted home made with duck and a lot of cabbage I had the crispy shrimp plate 107 earlier in the day which came out like a sweet and sour dish which isn t my cup of tea but it was crispy and well made in good quantity with a ton of rice Fast fast service Taiwanese mom approved 
qvrsizBk18vESKG-zOHnKA CMU Definitely a fan of Silk Pagoda Quality of the ingredients seemed to be pretty high compared to other Chinese joints in the city General Tso s was nice and crispy without too much gristle fat on the chicken hey it s a Chinese restaraunt what do you expect Sauce had a nice tangy flavor not too syrupy or sweet My friend ordered the sesame sliced chicken which had a really great creamy nutty savory sauce Like someone else said sometimes you just need greasy Chinese The next time I do I ll be heading to Silk Pagoda 
R-JCzGr9Nzz0Pk09vM_uIg CMU My girlfriend and I have ordered from here twice and she has gotten sick both times I have been OK but the quality of the food is definitely in the cheap category so those with sensitive stomachs need not apply 
R-k76pDHm_sE9_hUUwVcZQ CMU I went with a teryaki rice bowl and it just wasn t quite right The chicken was ok but whatever type of sauce was they used tasted like a supersaturated salt soy sauce solution It was not good I didn t expect great service and I wasn t wrong Would I come here again No Never 
r-QAdIGjWzFiM70-DK0n_g CMU Oh college When I think back on off campus food this place was perhaps the definition of what one looks for first Dirt cheap price to portion ratio convenient to campus and good food albeit with some land mines on the menu My roommate always got noodles or the ma po tofu I never got in to noodles as much and had several staples including the ma po tofu within the entrees The pork was my meat of choice The other meats were hit or miss The bubble tea and smoothies were also pretty good The tapioca was usually cooked correctly One of the drink makers once concocted me a milk tea with a bit of coffee in it which was incredible I can get better bubble tea in Houston but this was the best I had in Pittsburgh Four stars once you figure out your list of things you like here 
R06CcC0rSk0N_4ynpk0JNQ CMU I love this place This restaurant is hands down the best chinese place around the CMU UPitt area It s kind of hidden in the middle of Craig street so a lot of people don t know about it but it s pretty amazing I always eat here for their cheap cheap lunch specials 5 60 entree side and rice My favorite dishes here are Black Pepper Steak the Amazing Chicken and their Pad Thai The staff is here is usually super nice too All in all its a pretty great restaurant and definitely beats Lulu s or Oriental Express 
R0_A-ms0uBVtECBuykkqiQ CMU Good cheap and very quick food in the Oakland area Cheaper and quicker than lulus but quality is a little less than lulus 
r1XMnFFt4GYO4cz1UmgAkg CMU Closed Signage down Boarded up tight Phone disconnected 
raNjANu1nLwrl3PnGuOyCg CMU Do not order if you are hungry or in a hurry we ordered at 8 20 on a Sunday evening and were told around 40 minutes 65 minutes later we called and were told they were slammed Hard to believe on a Sunday evening They then told us another 30 45 minutes We cancelled as who wants to eat chinese at 10 15 10 30 Most disappointing as we asked them to call if it was going to be more than 50 minutes originally needless to say we will never use them again 
rcsBqvwa5gtXGfbbnX_pIg CMU The place is convenient reasonably priced and pretty good food I ve come here a number of times for lunch with colleagues as it is a nicer sit down place not too far from campus it s clean spacious enough and comfortable The menu consists of several noodle options American Mac spaghetti meatballs Asian Japanese pan noodles pad thai bangkok curry and Mediterranean Italian pasta and several salad and sandwich options All the meals are vegetarian by default with small about 4 50 and regular about 5 50 though you can add meat chicken steak shrimp meatballs or tofu for about an additional 2 50 I recommend the noodle options after all it is called Noodles Co 
rER3ySXXdXGWneqx9QnS9A CMU Szechuan Express is a solid place for cheap quick Chinese food It looks exactly like the hole in the wall places that line Clemente Street in San Francisco Just walk up to the counter place your order then take a seat or wait around to carry out The food here is not gonna blow you away with high quality or uniqueness but for 5 it will surely fill you up The garlic sauce tastes very similar to the chili sauce but again for 5 don t bring in unrealistic expectations Its a bit grungy inside so if you need it to be super clean to eat somewhere then maybe you should choose another spot A couple good dishes are beef noodle soup double cooked pork and chicken with garlic sauce The staff is extremely friendly too I usually stop in around 2 a couple days a week for lunch and the dude who works there is always laughing and having a good time with the customers 
RFAf-0SnqnxGI6rDJlWLdA CMU I lived across the street from Lulu s for three years Even though most of their food are Americanized they do have a few selections that are pretty authentic Their Hong Kong Beef Chow Fun tastes just like the stuff my mom used to make although a bit on the greasier side Their Singapore Mei Fun and Java Fried Rice were staples for me here If I were judging them based solely on these three dishes I would give them four stars however it took me a few tries before I found what was good there 
RpQl-CiC_FIOJU45KOo-Ug CMU What has happened to this place Used to be delicious but something s changed Rude host pointed us to a table of course the personal cell phone BS going on with a friend was far more important for a noon lunch in a nearly empty restaurant Nor good signs and we should have walked out then We started with a bland egg roll Moved on to fair won ton soup Entrees of cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken both on brown rice we re disappointing Left us both wishing that we had gone for Thai food down the street instead Save yourself and opt for one of the other fabulous dining experiences in Shadyside 
rrmkIGjg1Bx3M9gHV3ysUQ CMU I was looking for some good hot and sour soup I think you can totally judge a restaurant by its ability to make Hot and Sour soup and we ended up at this lovely little place I can see it being a pain during peak hours times due to parking and limited seating but I kind of think its worth the wait One they put Sriracha sauce on every table Two the Hot Sour soup is nom Three they had crispy noodle dishes I had the LuLu Pan Fried Noodles with pork While I didn t really care for their pork the pan fried noodles were deelish I had these once in another Chinese restaurant in Durham but I could never remember the name of the dish or how to describe it I don t think LuLu s stands out as a particularly awesome Chinese restaurant but it certainly wasn t bad If you re looking for something that isn t too authentic I d totally recommend this place 
RSUBeHZhMrtfusYiMhevHA CMU Great food an interesting little joint Very popular among Pitt students Only 4 stars bc service is regularly pretty bad The food still makes it worth the of admission 
RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA CMU Little Asia does offer some more authentic Chinese items however I haven t found my favorite yet All the dishes tend to be super greasy 
RUJxaMDtaX0opeC6eg_idQ CMU I really like Lulu s noodles Most of the time I m there I get the Lo Mein with Chicken It s always pretty delicious I did one time opt for Calamari in my Lo Mein instead of chicken and I was very disappointed It was extremely rubbery and almost inedible Lesson learned Although I had the issue with the Calamari I ve never had any other problems with Lulu s especially the service which seems to be often complained about and will continue to go there when I m in the neighborhood 
R_9WyuyefqHdYV7vLYHUDA CMU Lulu s is the first off campus restaurant I remember going to upon arriving in Pittsburgh and it holds so many fond memories which is why I m adding an extra star to this review What would Craig Street be without Lulu s Heck what would PITTSBURGH be without it They have a range of different menu items but I mainly stuck with their noodle dishes Love their beef lo mein and their crab rangoons The owner Mr Yan is the nicest guy ever and graciously helped out the student organization I was a part of when we ran a bubble tea fundraiser to help Hurricane Katrina victims I actually came to him second after the mean lady at Rose Tea refused to help us out 
-5z-2YPiSLF5lQh8czHjZA CMU ollie s works just fine if you happen to be at columbia university and need a quick bite the food is perfectly acceptable but nothing special on that basis i would have given it three stars the problem though is this busy eatery feels kind of dirty you wouldn t really feel that if you were doing takeout but the last two times that i ate there i sat at the back of the restaurant from there i got a full view of the bathroom doors and the messy stack of spare chairs etc this restaurant need to be a little better organized 
-8MwIPChqAB2BZo98NViUA CMU The food is mediocre but we ve been using them because they accept credit cards and we rarely keep cash on us DO NOT USE A CREDIT CARD HERE I had two orders within five days and wound up being charged three times twice for two different amounts on the same day I called them and the manager said he runs the receipts at the end of the night himself and that sometimes this happens Would I please wait one week and see if it came off This was the FIRST warning it happens sometimes He s obviously doing something wrong Well it was fair to wait so I did I called him a week later when the amount still hadn t come off He was obviously annoyed with me and got very short on the phone He kept insisting I do nothing illegal over and over I replied that I understood that but there had been a mistake and it needed to be fixed The amount was 36 20 and had come directly out of my checking account I wasn t happy He insisted the credit card company had looked into it and was working on the 20 00 mistake I reminded him that it was 36 20 and he started getting even louder with me We ended it with him giving me his cell number so I could send him a screen shot of my statement that clearly showed the three charges I sent it to him and waited two days to hear from him When I didn t hear from him I texted him since I always called at a bad time for him his words asking if he had a refund for me yet I waited another day and STILL did not hear from him Hence my reviews here If this is how he conducts business at this restaurant STAY AWAY There are MANY better places to get good Chinese food from This place has neither good food nor good business practices 
-bgxDvpmcAt6UJuH5COInQ CMU Ollie s is a joke amongst the Chinese citizens of the Columbia community They make fun of this place for claiming to serve Chinese food and they laugh about the clueless American diners who pay to eat it I have to admit that a few years ago I would stop by Ollie s for their spinach wonton soup on weekends However I was also on a strict diet at the time and noticed that I enjoyed every source of nourishment immensely In any case Ollie s has failed to impress me with any of their other dishes Their pork buns have little filling and are strangely sour wtf I once tried to order the General Tso s Chicken Americanized Chinese at its best and partway through eating the first piece I realized it was not fully cooked I cut all the other nuggets in half on my plate and discovered that 100 of them had bright pink middles What s really strange is that the cooked parts of the chicken were extremely dry which confused me about as much as the first time I had a Baked Alaska how do they bake ice cream cake without having it melt Another time I got their Taro Bubble Tea no bubbles Really if I had wanted a glass of milk with some purple food coloring I could have gotten it a lot cheaper at Morton Williams In any case I keep being forced to go to lunch meetings at this place and it upsets me because I really want Ollie s go out of business so a real restaurant can take over this little corner 
-HzsxUVID_gptFTSoRz0mQ CMU I wish I could give it two and a half stars if only because the lunch specials are cheap but involve a huge amount of food but the food isn t that great hence the two star rating The fried rice is mostly miss and never actually tastes fried Today my fried rice had clumps of untouched white rice spread throughout Not so tasty The wonton soup can be kind of tasteless but the chicken with broccoli is good The brown sauce totally covers some of the blandness of the rice Also they give out fortune cookies which makes me happy as the places near my apartment don t do that so lame 
-IlPMI0I1asgtzYXizqLoQ CMU its nearness cheapness and speed make it irresistible Columbia but they once sent me a soup that had an industrial size like 4 inch rusty STAPLE floating in it When I called to tell them this they said So don t eat it How s that for great customer service 
-LjtU0SqTvFVx2XCnO-NhA CMU Totally not appreciate this shop at all Bad service to stay or to go The dilervery guy shouted at me and my friend because he is not happy about the tip There s another time that we ordered a noodle soup and it tasted sour We are unhappy about the meal and one of the guy told us maybe it s because that we are not used to this flavor You could always get better food around the neighborhood Just can t get it why is this restaurant so fasinated by Columbia s students The only food you can give it a try is the beef noodle soup though it s greasy 
-n3Czfv1ibCesQ3nVcvofg CMU I had the pleasure of living in the Barnard dorm above Ollie s one sweltering summer I will never forget the smell of Ramen in the elevator every single day And that s a bad thing It actually makes me slightly shudder to think that I used to eat here when I was too lazy to go elsewhere for Chinese food Unless you get something that has been very very fried you are out of luck The servers always seems overworked and rather miserable It wasn t a huge surprise when the staff filed a lawsuit against the whole Ollie s chain in 2007 for not paying adequate wages see http query nytimes com gst fullpage html res 9402E0DF1130F933A05750C0A9619C8B63 and http www columbiaspectator com 2009 03 23 owner ollie s tomo pays record sum labor dispute The Ollie s near Lincoln Center actually has decent food I have no idea what the hell is going on with this one 
-sR8Fow7NA_Q0mjFvkdcww CMU Tons of MSG in the food even more than most Chinese take out places If you want to take an instant nap after eating order Panda I ordered the Garlic Shrimp combo that included shrimp pork fried rice and veggies They throw in those crunchy Chinese snacks and an eggroll I also got the won ton soup which was below average It came out to be 10 bucks Pretty quick and tasty stuff except it ll knock you out 
-xNGgMHMc5rrmsyiT3nnyA CMU This was awful I hated every minute of my experience there I had egg drop soup Funny thing is they forgot the flavor I also shared an order of pan fried pork dumplings I d say they forgot the flavor on this too except the parts of the wonton which they burnt definitely had some unpleasant flavor For an entree I had some noodles a wide noodle sauteed with some beef They were greasy and lacked any seasoning I should have sent everything back and left but I was hungry and it was late at night This place is always packed and so I thought it would be good Now I just want to know why the hell so many people are there all the time Surely they aren t there for the food 
0-cvBjERazfUo54740BAPQ CMU This place was AWFUL I went with a group of friends after visiting Columbia The food was crappy psuedo traditional Chinese and the service was horrendous I had the wonton soup noodles with roasted pork The broth was both extremely bland and very greasy The wontons and the roast pork were pretty flavorless The actual waiter who served us was very nice until it came time to pay the bill He very nicely told us that they couldn t split the check We were trying to figure out how to divide the bill when a female staff member maybe a manager came over and started waving the bill in our faces and yelling at us about how we couldn t split the bill I ended up putting it all on my card After we purposely left a shitty tip she actually followed us out of the restaurant onto Broadway and demanded an explanation We told her we didn t tip servers who were as unpleasant and mean as she had been She started yelling at us again and told us not to ever come back Terrible terrible experience Expensive sub par food insane staff I ll stick to Chinatown for good noodles 
0bdpY9ZLKyEQUr8jqQ7btg CMU I ve ordered take out several times and the girl sitting behind the cash register is rude unfriendly and has an attitude I never feel like going back but I do because this is the only Chinese restaurant in the area I m so ashamed I found out that the owner had to pay out 2 3 million in back wages in 2009 to 813 workers in many of his restaurants in what the State Labor Department called the largest amount ever collected in a single case of minimum wage and overtime violations I assume that is why the employees are so unhappy http www nytimes com 2009 03 19 nyregion 19ollies html The food here is not great It is the only Chinese restaurant by Columbia University on Broadway The lunch specials are not worth buying because the main course comes in the smallest containers I ve ever seen I wouldn t order here based on the fact that this place is a sweat shop 
0bqD3Cdz1bs1bFwBNk-xJA CMU For a cheap Chinese take out this is as good as it gets Wai Lee was a great companion for most of my undergrad career Its certainly comfort food And the delivery was always fast even in rain and snow 
0ERY2HvLhTCEQlaNzdSQDA CMU Good chinese food kiddy corner to the entrance of Columbia University Always packed with students Great amount of food for your buck 
0Ru1MDcfH-hWCH7KkxXlDg CMU Don t bother 
0_ziEfyEGNSgHIBUgurnBA CMU Honestly Ollie s is pretty good chinese food If you re in the neighborhood and craving chinese just do it All you hataz it s chinese food don t expect a big production It s salty saucy and sometimes greasy just eat it 
1DPjKYIgS4NxcGeWNeKFZQ CMU The food is good Nothing amazing Their chilli sauce is good but I always feel sick after eating Service is awful They simply dont care about you 
1ezQ2DZM-k_OHlUSMpwF8Q CMU The only dumplings I consider good there are shrimp pork or chicken corn The others are so so That being said those two are quite good Aside from that the service is pretty bad if you sit down and absolutely horrible when you order a delivery They mixed up my order several times got addresses wrong and did not refund me even when they said they would I ended up disputing a charge on my credit card because I was fed up In short it s a good dumpling place for the area but save yourself grief and just call ahead and pick up and make sure your order is correct EDIT So I gave them one more star because honestly these are the best dumplings around Columbia if you stay away from the veggie or the mushroom ones Service hasn t changed much in the sense that it s basically nonexistent 
1Qx5Ln94sdALK6KjZlOntA CMU Really enjoyed this spot They had alot of different soups with different broths which is my love I think I tried three different soups and I really did like them all Seriously take some time and go through the menu as there are alot of options That being said if you re not that far uptown already or at Columbia I cant say I reccomend you making the trip but if you re in the hood Give it a shot Service sucks as mentioned 
1rsaQp_YTAwogu7V7sFjLQ CMU This place has the best straight up classic NYC Chinese food in the neighborhood Nothing particularly fantastic but they are quite courteous and delivery is shockingly fast 
1Tjflx42PLgGxGP1sCaCGg CMU Bleh it helps a whole hell of a lot if you aren t getting delivery AND you speak fluent chinese not because they don t understand English but because their disservice towards non Chinese speakers sometimes borders on racism Weak Delivery radius is huge because the guys are on vespas great for those living in both East and West Harlem and wanting non yellow rice and authentic soups over ghetto fab Chinese food but it is slow as hell Plus the drivers can be downright rude if you don t leave what they feel is a high enough tip 20 at least One driver tried to push his way into our apartment when he felt the tip wasn t high enough to which my roommate responded by slamming the door in his face Ridiculous Only a few pluses the fried rice comes with edamame and is a huge portion they deliver bubble tea in sealed containers that last the trip and the menu is extensive Other reviewers are exactly right on the college pop keeping this place open it needs to just fade away At least the Ollie s at Lincoln Center though also rude has better food Lame lame lame Don t go 
208m0hSzlDcjILc0dSR9mA CMU I am not a dumpling connoisseur but I think this adorable little dumpling restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood Just went hear for lunch and shared the following 1 steamed vegetable dumplings these were probably the least flavored of all 3 but had a nice ginger taste and fresh ingredients 2 steamed chicken with basil DELICIOUS superbly flavored and fresh loved 3 pan fried pork with cabbage i didn t see any cabbage in here but the pork was really good very juicy great quality pork Dumplings are LARGE they don t scrimp on size Since i don t usually eat dumplings even though they are expensive comparatively to others i thought it was a super cheap meal so win win for me Also i ate in and the restaurant is very clean and tastefully decorated 
2b8yIzlUT2mBBzpqdPz_qg CMU There are definitely better places on Upper West than this Would not go back 
2C2gzy0iVBd4_FC8IhE8qQ CMU please don t spend your money eating here i have TRIED to like this place due to is close vicinity to school however despite the convenience of the location i just cannot bring myself to eat here anymore the service is bad and the food is just awful why is ollie s still here 
2fZ4t-MZWcJUXd_EqTZ_og CMU When i think Chinese I order from Ollie s My order is almost always Black bubble tea Steamed little juicy buns Wontons in hot sesame sauce and Chicken mooshu Beef with string beans or the Pork and eggplant casserole For years I would only order in as the service here was horrid However I recently met a friend here after the new renovations and for the first time I had a pleasurable experience The waiter was attentive and even fixed a mistake without making me feel bad for asking I hope they continue to hire customer service oriented people because I love the food This is the only Chinese place that I can order in from that doesn t make me feel sick As a plus they will deliver to up to Inwood if you like 
2noihoOKhmaKqBJ_Rh8ojQ CMU Today s order at Ollie s chicken fried rice fried vegetable roll fried pork dumpling 2 diet coke Well I don t know what everyone is whining about I just had an amazing experience with Ollie s I ordered because 1 there are so few even marginal places in my neighborhood Riverside Dr W 149th St and 2 I wanted to see if they would deliver so far uptown Because frankly I only have great memories of the food I ve eat in or taken out of Ollie s never had delivery before THE ORDER PROCESS First the lady taking my order was so polite clear spoken and easy to work with Wow puts the non English speakers in my neighborhood to shame She got my phone and address into the system double checked it read back each item as I ordered gave me a total without my having to ask Everything about the order taking process impressed me thoroughly I ordered at 7 40 PM and called back at 8 18 PM 38 mins later to check the status Again the lady was polite and not the least bit perturbed at my call She said 15 20 more minutes The moment I hung up the buzzer rang So 39 minutes to get over 40 blocks Yeah I can definitely live with that Plus the delivery guy was extremely pleasant THE FOOD First I ate my fried pork dumplings They were amazing Smaller than the huge doughy cement like dumplings so many places sell you know the ones the size of a tumor with a questionable meat filling These were dainty 8 of them and they were perfectly crisped brown with the right amount of sauce Scrumptious I was in heaven and knew I had done the right thing by giving Ollie s a shot Next I ate the vegetable roll Very nice the shell was flaky and the contents were nice A bit more oily than it needed to be but I would order it again Last the chicken fried rice Ollie s has the best in town best anywhere Today for the first time in 10 years it was a bit overdone But it was still delicious flavorful moist less then it usually is and very hot I m sure next time it will be better The sodas could have been a bit colder Didn t get a menu or enough soy sauce Not a biggie next time I ll ask THE PRICE I paid 18 plus and added 5 for a tip More than I usually spend on Chinese food but frankly it was worth the money because I am sick of ghetto Chinese and am so psyched Ollie s delivers to Hamilton Heights I am totally perplexed at the many 1 star ratings But maybe I have something to learn If you know a much better place on the West Side feel free to message me the details I will try them if they deliver to me and check back 
2WTwL71T3u3-DJT-9oVJLw CMU Ollie s is the poster child of mediocrity Long ago when first trying it I proclaimed the food to be pretty good Since then however more recent proclamations have included the phrases weird bland and what s wrong with that meat You can do better 
33nZUsxPkP3WKaaNbfiwjg CMU Worst Service Ever Ventured to Ollie s for some wonton noodle soup and pork buns and all I got was this lousy service I also got the wonton noodle soup and pork buns which were just meh But the real standout in that it stood out as remarkably bad was the service From the 360 RPM eye rolls you d think a request for some chili sauce was some sort of weird exotic desire For the record apparently this Ollie s was cleared of any labor wrongdoings http www columbiaspectator com 2009 04 13 local ollies not part ny labor case but that speaks nothing of the customer wrongdoings perpetrated at every lunch hour 
3d3sbVYgIUcW669b_8ydqw CMU Ideally 31 2 stars Okay so this place may not be the first place you run to for Chinese food But when you need greasy Chinese delivery for an affordable price there is none like it Hubby and I have tried numerous other Chinese take outs near this area W 90 100 s w comparable prices but this place actually comes closest to being the most authentic efficient and affordable Some faves Roast Pork Mei Fun Beef w Ginger and Scallion Roast Pork w Bean Sprouts or Chinese Veggies Their lunch specials come with roast pork fried rice and soup of choice One lunch special can last till dinner if you are not a big eater Delivery takes usually under 20 minutes rain or shine Decent Chinese for two under 15 and hubby and I can down a lot of food Chicken Wings w Garlic Sauce is hit or miss 
3JI1ZI1mfdhscShI2PYMMA CMU I have been here three straight days with different friends 
3O9PqcMvu4Zx7NI94znf5g CMU so so 
3QDfMKo1OPMwjy4FXJOt5A CMU I used to go to this place a lot while I lived near Columbia campus The food was greasy and just edible at most Some of the dishes were just so horrible that I couldn t finish more than a few bites The service was the worst Very rude One time I tipped them 50 cents short and they told me to come back and pay Crazyy I was a regular customer and they only wanted that fifty cents Fine I gave them and never stepped back in again unless my friends wanted to go there for quick and cheap food 
3rkBPjOSv98j-H5LyDiuhQ CMU Probably the Chinese restaurant that I go to the most in the neighborhood and my teen age niece and nephew always want to go here when I take them out for dinner Apparently my sister never takes them out for Chinese food By comparison it s much more pleasant than going to the Ollie s five blocks up and over on Broadway It s a lot quieter nowhere near as brightly lit and you re more likely to see family units Service and food are maybe about the same 
3tRVd4vL4a1XkcD_LmBKIA CMU This place is a hole in the wall not much to look at and I have no idea how clean it is Having said that the food is cheap delicious and fast If you are a fan of divey Chinese then this is the place for you 
4Ene9wGhgrM3kE4pz7szgw CMU You go to Columbia Cottage when you want 1 A table for a large group Columbia Cottage is a popular choice for Lit Hum classes at the end of the semester because though the restaurant isn t exactly large they are one of the few restaurants that will rearrange tables to easily seat 15 people Eat family style or individually both are feasible It s only a bummer when you go with your class since most freshman can t legally take advantage of the 2 Free carafes of white wine It s boxed wine and really nothing special but you can t hate on free 3 Something other than Chinese takeout Though you ll see some familiar Chinese American dishes on the menu General Tso s sesame chicken Columbia Cottage also has a Shanghai menu which has some gems like rice cakes seafood winter melon etc I ve never had a bad meal at Cottage but I figure it s mostly I because eat family style and tend to over order for the table Quality and portions were always excellent 4 A little atmosphere It s not fancy but they have white table cloths and wine glasses so it s not a takeout place either The windows are nice I guess Ultimately not a terrible choice but never one that anyone craves When I m hungry for Chinese food I ll make the trip to Flushing Chinatown or my aunt s But when fellow schoolmates want to eat eggrolls I steer them away from Ollie s and suggest Cottage 
4epsQmBgJITExIY2czwajw CMU I ate here out of desperation for Chinese food and I paid the price I think the noodle dishes I ve eaten here are decent but the typical Chinese meat dishes were not so bueno This place is fast but the food is low quality I m scared to eat here again 
4HjEZ868BOGvoddpyMnmPA CMU Basically your neighborhood hole in the wall Chinese standby with low prices and quick service Everything is decent the sweeter sauces tend to congeal at room temperature though Maybe too much corn starch and the lo mein is actually pretty good even better reheated on the pan 
4INg7-CvT9DVUrTv21qGTQ CMU Horrible service for good inexpensive food go a few doors down to peking garden 
4jwSqJaDAPyzpT8-2LkdEw CMU I go to Ollies a lot to get takeout and they are very very good with vegetarian stuff Although the service leaves quite a bit to be desired my food is always good and I can get a veggie bun in five minutes I mean come one if you are rushing here for a 15 minute lunch do you really expect the service to be amazing I also think the food is pretty good too 
4oON6S56IYaad41UG4-8yw CMU I was not impressed at all For a restaurant that is called east dumpling house you would think the dumplings are delicious My friend and I shared 2 orders of dumplings Both were meh I ve made better dumplings myself from the frozen section at Trader Joes Cheaper too I will not be back 
4WBFpvFxboRY8vPIhX8TnQ CMU Fried rice Worst fried rice that was served in a restaurant that I have ever had I would rather cook my own food thanks Beef with string beans was aite Nothing spectacular Who the freak is Zagat and why should we listen to him 
51zvjysSl7wyCPEZURB3jA CMU Hi I m Ellen and I m addicted to Ollie s I ve spent a total of about two months in China over three trips and eating at Ollie s is about as close as you re gonna get to eating in Beijing at least if you re much closer to Columbia University or the 72nd St Subway station than you are to Worker s Stadium The whole menu is inspiring but I usually stick to a big bowl of roast duck wonton soup That is a luscious satisfying meal for what 7 00 
53sJEp7PajrpIppYD5civA CMU I ve gotten sick on their food Twice Going back the second time was my stupidity Don t make the same mistake 
5nPwtbGuPI_CssE8mF-kHQ CMU Most of my Asian friends despise this place but will sometimes order out for the scallion pancakes or the spicy beef noodle soup There is nothing more I can say about Ollie s at 116th that others haven t already said but I just wanted to announce that as of March 2009 the BUBBLE TEA STATION that used to be at Swish which newly renovated is now called Vine IS NOW AT OLLIE S WOOHOO And prices unchanged too Yay for the fact that I can still get bubble tea when Cafe East closes at like 6pm or some other ridiculously early time Just for that I shall rate Ollie s with 3 stars 
5qQW4SApZb2wImt6YVIpjw CMU Every time I have a hankering for Chinese food I always find that the greasy bad for you stuff always hits the spot Let s face it people Are you really looking for a Zagat rated Chicken and Broccoli dish when you re looking for Chinese food This place is quick and cheap Since Columbia is taking all of my money it s the perfect place to avoid Top Ramen dinners 
5udKXTKQ_qeXrgvyyoaKSg CMU Just came here for my first Ollie s trip The menu is extensive and the service is fast Don t expect flare and doting You re here for a quick bite for not too much mula Seriously I think the quantity is great for the price so I m not sure what other reviewers are complaining about You re certainly not going to get the best Chinese meal in the city but when you want a break from studying and some warm Chinese comfort food I d definitely recommend Ollie s 
5x1ouzYF6Lfz0yOnyjJ2Gw CMU Pan Asian with lots of grease This place is loaded with mediocrity However it has provided respite in many late night cravings for sushi and fried rice simultaneously Stay away from the Pad Thai China and Japan they ve got down Thailand on the other hand needs some work 
64nO021-LGcacuiTOeHbug CMU How do you say amazing in Korean Sadly the restaurant is on an avenue street and probably does not get as much foot traffic attention as it should I did learn though that Columbia U and the new bubble tea spot uptown sell s the dumplings Give the assorted dumplings a try Like most my must haves are the pork and chives shrimp and pork and if you are adventurous the soup dumplings with noodles are a great warm up on those bitter cold days PS Plan to have leftovers bring take out containers 
6CpdgfHOuUhJcnvOmthg6A CMU I had the chicken and shitake mushroom dumplings steamed and the pork and chive dumplings pan fried The pork dumplings were my favorite but both definitely hit the spot The food was flavorful and the price was inexpensive I will definitely be going back 
6DpwlMhDZAR1L0_jeYR6ow CMU If you re in the neighborhood stop by Empire Corner for fairly fantastic dumplings However I wouldn t recommend it as a place for getting full meals everything tastes like old overused cooking oil 
6LY9Ua1GHLHbP3E4bOIfeg CMU The General Tso that is has spoken and he says get your local Chinese delivery from Wai Lee I like to fancy myself an experienced connoisseur of the Tso s chicken The Tso s at Wai Lee is not miraculous but rather abundant and satisfying Some tweaking of their recipe wouldn t hurt However if getting your feed on is what s important and you crave a copious serving of chicken slathered in sweet heat really not spicy at all but sounded good dial no further In all honesty the pork fried rice easily outshines the Tso s Not necessarily a bad thing in my book given that pork fried rice is the backbone of all Chinese American cuisine You might consider ordering a 1L of their homemade sweetened iced tea too I always do Oh so refreshing Aside from being pretty tasty generously portioned and cheap cheap cheap Wai Lee s delivery is psychotically fast Man I really feel guilty for not giving that guy a 50 tip He s getting a 10 spot next time Also the person that takes orders by phone is easy to communicate with i e you don t have to know how to speak Chinese to eat Chinese Bonus Anyway in this hood where good food at a cheap price is rare Wai Lee s is greatly appreciated 
6nrgQpyXnfarppWMl79i4A CMU Really tasty perfectly pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings Ask for the spicy dipping sauce It s fab and the eight piece was so filling I could only finish six of them 
6P778vj1De2Pq9dJJm-GLQ CMU One of my favorite places to order from Fast and consistent delivery Big portions and great price Some of my faves are fried chicken gizzard fried chicken pieces sesame chicken Most of their items are pretty good When I move I m gonna miss this place 
6r-fj00a2z0DpRHmc8V6Qw CMU Wai Lee doesn t have the best Chinese food in the world or in Morningside Heights for that matter but it does have really good prices and fast delivery When you don t have enough money to pay for Ollie s or a more substantial Chinese restaurant Wai Lee is there and it doesn t even ask that you leave the building I usually order the orange chicken combination platter and it s good The soup isn t the best but the egg rolls are really good I m not sure how I feel about the fried rice but it s as good as can be expected for the really low price 
70LoM_QHyMjkp5XUm-Heag CMU Their 11 30am 2 00pm take out lunch offer is a very good deal for the thrifty and starving among the Columbia students perhaps the cheapest food in Manhattan for 5 you ll get a decent portion of brown white fried rice along with three sides of your own choice a variety of stir fried meats and vegetables and deep fried rolls but watch out for the bones in meats I like their lemongrass honey chicken and broccoli chicken Finally you ll get to pick a passable but hearty soup eggdrop is okay huge wontons are nice but the meat inside is clearly not grade A chicken noodle soup is extremely rich but greasy Don t be afraid of the queue they re fabulously efficient The food tends to be greasy but better than in most similar places 
7gSmFTM_VmM6baDBptf9WQ CMU Great cantonese style soups Dumplings are also superb especially the seafood dumplings 
7jJQyx3amMZVLumOwfi60g CMU Really low quality food do not recommend The food came out in literally 2 minutes which is more than a little unnerving 
7utqg2_WGe6ccHGtRMkI_g CMU I ve heard mixed reviews and had mixed experiences Either you are completely unsatisfied with the service or food or it s actually decent I personally think it s funny that whenever I dine in I can communicate pretty well with the staff but anytime I order over the phone I get someone who doesn t speak English 
7ZK_rbzCXGJCRRHvbQiKMA CMU The beef stew noodle here is amazing I almost considered transferring to Columbia just so I could eat it more often Also I would visit my Columbia friends under the auspice of hanging out when really I just wanted to get Ollie s beef stew noodle 
8fYHm9jsHj0McIYgqvO8dQ CMU I seriously crave dumplings and East Dumpling House really hits the spot The dumplings are very flavorful and the skin is never too thick I especially love the shitake mushroom dumplings My only complaint is that they can be a little greasy even the steamed ones the meat just seems like its a little fattier than normal 
8OVQ_fxr3lBQ6s9FC0MP8Q CMU Ugh Occasionally ok all the time I have this craving for greasy chinese I m not too picky about my greasy chinese I just want it to taste good I mean might as well be delicious if I m going to consume my day s worth of calories This place was a major disappointment We ordered take out and the delivery was speedy However the ocean scallops stir fry hunan style was disgusting Bland and the asian mushrooms tasted old Crab rangoon had no flavor just greasy fried dough The hot and sour soup was decent but it didn t have much to it besides the broth Skip Empire Corner and go elsewhere chances are you will get far better chinese food somewhere else I wish I would have read the yelp reviews before ordering Oh well 
8wotgCIGh8TU-J-_ynz_nQ CMU Writing this as I eat them They are super tasty The wrapper is thin but nice and chewy mucho importante when it comes to dumpling quality Am eating the shitake mushroom basil and chicken dumplings and I m in love The combination of flavors is a winner Definitely going to check them out again Can t wait to eat all the other types they have 
8X3jYvwXPuT7ZWLiAMha_w CMU Mediocre food combined with the worst service in New York We ask the waitress to make one dish extra spicy and when it arrives we ask which one was extra spicy and she goes THEY ARE ALL SPICY and leaves They have a terrible attitude and they stand over your table watching while you write in the tip We were going to give them a below average tip 13 and then they complain and say it is a mandatory 15 when their service is so bad that it really doesn t warrant tip at all They are only in business because desperate college students do not have many options for food in this area I will never eat here again The beef stew noodle is just okay They suck 
92FYA3IkNrapHKV8-K86iA CMU Great neighborhood spot and wonderful to have a good dumpling place in Manhattan Valley I thought the dumplings were excellent and big and the scallion pancake was also really really yummy You can definitely tell that the dumplings are hand made seemingly to order and the staff is very friendly and welcoming If you re thinking of going here today for lunch or dinner definitely give it a try I don t think you ll be disappointed 
92WlA23sSLcCWeTtBVkzYQ CMU Ollie s makes some fast delicious beef noodle soup Only been here on rare occasions when visiting New York and this is the only thing I order here I can t seem to find any good beef noodle soup places in South Florida sadly either I am blind and or unaware For about 8 it is really good tender meat spicy broth thin noodles and they prepare it really quickly It is a shame that the service here is so terrible though I am not sure why they are so rude and impatient I ve ordered both in Chinese to try and get on the good side and English in case my Chinese was just not good on separate visits and was treated badly anyway and practically ignored during my meal It s frustrating but then again I don t really care much because I get to have some delicious beef noodle soup Overall Ollie s is A OK bad service but a good place to have a really quick meal 
9HYvTposrs6Hd3v7oIn1LQ CMU Authentic and delicious northeastern Chinese cuisine There are few things that I enjoy more on brisk fall days than soup and dumplings and the food here hit the spot East Dumpling House knows and executes Chinese noodle and dumpling cuisine very well One thing that sets this place apart from other East Asian restaurants in New York City is that they have selected a specific cuisine sub cuisine even and they stick to it Here you won t find an endless maze of a pan Asian menu that spans the vast diversity of cuisines from different Asian cultures I am always leery of Asian restaurants that serve both pad thai and sashimi there are far too many of these Swiss Army knife Asian restaurants in NYC Not here Instead they stick to the meat and potatoes of China s northeast which you could characterize as wholesome doughy Chinese comfort food The menu features classics such as scallion pancakes pan fried egg and chive dumplings ugly dumpling a wide variety of steamed and pan fried dumplings and a variety of soup noodles and cold noodle dishes we stuck to the dumplings but we ll try some of these others next I m not aware of another place quite like this on the Upper Westside much less one that serves tasty and authentic dumplings so it s a welcome addition to the neighborhood This cuisine is not easy to pull off but this meal impressed us My wife and I shared an order of steamed shrimp and pork dumplings and an order of steamed pork and chive dumplings shuijiao jiaoze pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings guotie and a small order of Shanghai wonton soup This is enough food to feed a table of four but call us ambitious and hungry The filling in each of these dumplings was fresh and delicious consisting of chopped ingredients that are mixed together but distinct In other words no mushy ambiguous globs of mystery meat 1 Steamed shrimp and pork My favorite A generous serving of chopped shrimp ground pork and some vegetables I appreciated being able to distinguish the shrimp from the other ingredients 2 Pork with chives Well done and balanced The chives were not overpowering and the seasoning was perfect My wife thought the meat was a bit too chewy but I liked it 3 Pan fried pork and cabbage Tasty and crispy but a bit unevenly browned The bottoms of some of the pan fried dumplings were dark brown while others were only slightly browned 4 Wonton soup The skin was a bit too thick for wontons but the filling was tasty it featured ground pork and minced vegetables including I believe shiitake mushrooms The steaming broth clear and light tasted like seaweed and a hint of chicken broth Judging from the dumpling skin the dumplings here are probably made very quickly sometimes this leads to dumpling catastrophe with meat and filling rebelling from the flour casing but these dumplings remained intact Columbia students and other Upper Westsiders should flock to this place a rare gem of East Asian cuisine on the Upper Westside The price is right and the food is tasty 
9IvJNLfAAenyLSNFbOXsEg CMU Cheap fast good chinese relatively speaking 
9MSw4LYWqu3YYLm8TR6vNg CMU I give it 3 stars Notable considering that the other Chinese places around here don t even deserve 1 star I ve ordered from them twice now and was impressed that they stored my address from the first time Speedy decent Chinese food Huge portions Tasty gyoza Good dumplings Arrived piping hot in 10 minutes 
9N7jFWb8_QC079zlYGssxg CMU I guess if you live up in Harlem Heights you are starved for decent food Ollie s is the best Chinese I ve found willing to deliver North of 140th Street I ve been to the restaurant a couple of times and it is just okay It is a mainstay for delivery despite it s average food If there was one thing that I could recommend it would be the shrimp fried rice the soy beans are a welcome addition I ll be back until something better is found 
9PhE0w5qxFhrMVf74UNm4g CMU The service is poor The waiters were rude and the food was not fantastic at all My friends and I were super disappointed and indeed shocked by their attitude towards customers I would not go there again They even complained about our 15 tips although the service was terrible Super not recommended 
9Q0KGu6xSReRCsfsJ2uSHw CMU Considering the terrible service and mediocre food it s a wonder Ollies is so packed You get better food at the hole n the walls around Columbia than this place This restaurant may have the worst service in NY Chinese restaurants arent normally known for their attention to custmoer service but this place deserves a medal Please do not support this place we need to send a message to place with terribe service and subpar food that this is unaccpetable in NY 
9rHyenaWJmw6K9Eax_KL-Q CMU Alright but not REALLY Chinese 
9UUrlKyT-jQv6seKxoULVw CMU Kind of surprised at the awful reviews My experience food came quickly was abundant and tasted good It s not authentic I suppose though what really is and it s closer to Chinese fast food than haute cuisine But it served its purpose and was crazy cheap for NYC Very troubled to see the labor issues in the photos above I feel kind of dirty for having eaten there now 
9V11mU_5HgKoPVQwxX790Q CMU Since I work nearby I have had lunch here a few times Chinese fast food tends to be greasy high in sodium salty and overall not exactly healthy With that in mind I always question my judgment when getting food here but unfortunately I have done so on a few occasions The food at Ollie s is just that greasy and extremely salty I usually have chicken with broccoli or rice with sauteed vegetables and I ve noticed that I always drink lots and lots of water to get rid of the taste in my mouth Also not once did I avoid stomachache after eating this food Maybe it s bad quality of their ingredients or maybe my stomach just can t handle all the grease and soy sauce but I do try to avoid this place and do not recommend it to others Halal food carts on the block serve much better food With that said I ve always experienced fast service Maybe that is the problem the food is prepared long in advance and is just sitting in oil waiting to be served within 3 minutes of me placing the order Eek An extra note their lunch take out comes with free soup so you get quite a lot of food for under 7 or so dollars I wouldn t touch that soup with a stick but just sayin 
A0kg6B7In81vO4ZiSIxjEQ CMU Best general Tso s chicken ever the problem is that it s inconsistent and sometimes you may have undercooked white meat instead of the delicious crunch fried goodness Other than that the rest of the food is pretty ordinary Staff is WAY rude And they always have you sit on top of each other Even if you come during lunchtime and the place is half empty they will sit you a foot next to another table Very greasy But like I said if you want to have the best general tso s chicken around you have to come to ollie s 
A42ZA6_URl0cR2ZrQn4RrQ CMU Pretty basic and standard I appreciate that they serve brown rice but the tofu vegetable was a bit gloppy Still I ll come back 
Ad920SIL6RfI4H8Eojjhwg CMU Ollies is great for delivery It is scary fast I have eaten inside there a few times but the food comes much quicker if you have it delivered Standard Americanized Chinese fare at a reasonable price whats not to like 
ajB1Vjgf-bJbiLy44oDabg CMU The first time I ordered from New Aroma they gave me Sesame Chicken instead of General Tso s The second time I ordered from New Aroma they hung up on me after placing me on hold for a few minutes before taking my order They got the order right this time but the lo mein was gross It was dry and spongy and the sauce was kind of sticky It s relatively close to my apartment but I can t see myself ordering from New Aroma again anytime soon 
aka1wCqF3Q5fcilYiowDZQ CMU Huge portions low prices mostly bad food What was OK to tasty garlic crispy chicken any kind of dumpling wonton soup Everything else I ve tasted has been lifeless and bland no mean feat considering the amount of grease used in making every dish There s no fee for delivery and it will arrive at your door in mere nanoseconds Other than that there s little to recommend this place 
akNcXuBWTm5KIOq255jTXQ CMU My go to spot for Chinese food in the neighborhood I usually get sesame chicken and broccoli with brown rice consistently delicious non greasy and ridiculously well portioned for the price I love having tons leftover for another meal or 2 or 3 I recently tried the shrimp and mushrooms and really enjoyed it I haven t tried it but my roommate swears by their homemade iced tea What can I say Wai Lee never fails to fulfill my Chinese food cravings 
AkQh1f14q-4Ew7J42mFkZw CMU Some of the worst Chinese food I ve ever had The fried rice somehow they managed to make it tasteless And the other people eating it commented on that too The egg roll looked good from the outside crispy but the filling was tasteless also The general tsaos was ok A friend got tofu kung pao took one bite and said he couldn t eat it It tasted like dish soap And a second person agreed Only my friend who will eat anything managed to eat it I would never order here again I love West Place on 123 and Amsterdam their lunch specials for 5 25 with soup soda plus rice and entree are a good deal and their food tastes good 
AMTjQzWR3V7q0TGiqTKlkA CMU Curry chicken noodle soup was great and dumplings were very good best if let rest for a few minutes before eating to cool and to reabsorb moisture Ate at restaurnt small but nice 
aMUEGhBlsVK3fWz36TYo-A CMU I am at a loss as to why this restaurant has so many negative reviews I tend to stick toward the soups here which are rather simple and refreshing while being pretty large and modestly priced Considering how close it is to the Columbia campus you would expect the cost to be more extortionate That said the food isn t really inventive or inspiring but it s good for a cheap meal when you want to stay near Columbia 
Aoq5nQOV97P1vR7sMrVEdw CMU ICK I came here one day when I was on campus and starving hoping for some semi decent Americanized Chinese food No such luck Most of my pieces of orange chicken had little to no chicken in them and when they did it was a fatty dark meat mess The rice was overdone and the whole thing was basically inedible It was crowded so I guess it appeals to some people but I can do without the rude service and gross food for 15 
aQiWOl7cjUvoHz00cdioXQ CMU The worst Chinese restaurant I ever have The service is horrible and rude 
ASO556KDfMLFRAlZ7GrQ6g CMU If you are looking for decent chinese food delivery in morningside heights this is definitely the best option This is not gourmet chinese food but it is surprisingly tasty I serve this for meetings I have at Columbia and every time someone asks me where it is from as they are pleasantly surprised by the fact that there is good takeout in the area I am vegetarian and I must say that all the vegetable dishes are well cooked flavorful and not too greasy The food is of course slightly greasy but for chinese takeout standards it isn t too bad 
asuOWAVTCW4UdDXzP4zFIQ CMU delivery I found the dumplings to be great I was glad to see that the dumpling wrapper was not the hard floury thick and chewy kind of wrapper I had the pan fried pork chive dumpling which was pleasantly enveloping a slightly textured elegantly thin moderately slippery wrap The chive to pork proportions were just right capturing a slight tang of the chive without being overpowering on the pork Next time I order I ll probably go the non fried route however because the pan fried bunch had too much residual oil on the dumpling and therefore kind of quelched the effect of the nice wrapper Overall though the dumplings had a comforting kind of feel Will order again Haven t tried the other stuff 
AtZ7GD3A2xuqByzJpS4yow CMU My favorite chinese food restaurant Great tasting food reasonable prices for manhattan great fried rice yummy Comfortable environment clean roomy service is decent but if your with good company it wont matter tell them Blue wizard sent u or maybe not yeah dont do that hehe they might throw an egg roll at you or something lol 
AujNWVBXG-miioqHTNWRVQ CMU I m not sure when these guys opened but I ve been walking by there for months If I m ordering out Chinese I usually go with West Place or Thai Market for Thai food MMM I ve lived in the neighborhood for 4 years and have little experience with the faster food joints along 116 FDB but noticed a few weeks ago these guys had an A rating and you can t help but notice how bright it is in there which I thought was a plus So last night on my way back from Best Yet Market I decided I d stop in ask for a menu and check it out They were super friendly The menu was standard and one thing I really liked was that you can watch everything being prepared in their galley kitchen I ordered dumplings fried rice and egg rolls and all of it was very good In fact friend rice was quite a bit better than I ve had delivered from places up near Columbia I think I ve found my new place And it s so close I can just pick it up myself 
AWJVgJ0IrXRR_Hj-M3Snvg CMU Ollie s is a solid 2 5 Like Noodle World near UCLA Ollie s is a decent place if you don t have the times or means to travel farther for good food I routinely get the wonton soup and sometimes with fish balls The broth is a bit bland until you add chili sauce you have to ask for it they re a little skimpy on the wontons but it s cheap and it fills you up I also like that they add a decent portion of Chinese greens on top makes me feel healthy Once I got the cashew chicken at lunch definitely wouldn t recommend anything except their noodle soups There wasn t much chicken to begin with the cashews tasted stale and soft and really I was just eating it because I was hungry The sauce mostly just tasted salty and yet bland at the same time and from samplings of others foods most sauces at Ollie s all taste the same salty and bleh Stick to their noodle soups safe and edible 
AXWk-mzcmy4WNkTHzKPltA CMU I swear the nasty reviews must have been written by the snooty Columbia students Is Ollies the best Chinese food in the world Of course not But the service is lightning fast no nonsense the choices are abundant the flavors hit the spot You get fed and they re not greedy with the amount I come here a lot and will continue to 
b3kVd3LZEXx5QBYk6AqX5w CMU If we consider the selection of restaurants in Morningside Heights I d say that a three is pretty flattering Columbia Cottage offers nothing spectacular But the Chinese food is decent There are some good tofu options The dumplings are good The shanghai noodles have never disappointed me If you find yourself in the Columbia University vicinity this is probably one of your better choices 
B7skna-owkgRf4VhJgXn2w CMU I got chicken fried rice it was good not the best I ve ever had though The bubble teas are too sweet for me 
bdGPtSnRo2_Z2f-mS3r0pw CMU Got take out here a little while back after reading some of the reviews on Yelp Unfortunately much like many of the Chinese food I ve gotten it made me feel icky I don t eat chicken pork or red meat from Chinese places unless the chicken is free range which I ve never found so I m just talking about the shrimp it made me feel like dying Ok not that bad but I don t want it again 
BOC7J7VMbeh0u6KAnoFXgA CMU This is the bastard of Chinese food who grew up somewhere in the corn country of Kansas stumbled his way to the East Coast found a prime location right outside the Columbia gates lures you in with the bright windows reasonable prices and gigantic portions and then kicks you repeatedly in the balls from the very first grease soaked mouthful to the very last digestive rumble I still ate here all four years in college when I was dying for anything remotely resembling something that would come out of my mom s kitchen My stand by s were beef noodle soup until I found a huge hunk of bone chicken noodle soup with pickled veggies the broth was delicious until one day they gave me a ball of chicken I m talking an intertwined mess of a tiny bit of chicken meat tons of fat and tons of gristle curry chicken and chicken with mixed veggies Their lunch specials are perfect for a poor college student s budget but you were warned you ll bloat up like crazy from all the sodium unless your stomach decides to revolt first from all the oil Service remains at a plateau of general shittiness throughout your meal menus are slapped down on the table orders taken without a single word questions unanswered waters unfilled and checks slapped down halfway through your meal This place s location portions and prices are its only redeeming qualities but look people what do you see A 1 subway stop right across the street Half hour ride to Chinatown Yet cities will fall oceans will rise and you will still go eat Ollies food 
BPUGErfo6gy36uAKLFZVwQ CMU I ve never been inside but i have ordered from a bunch of Chinese restaurants and this is by far the best cheap Chinese food in the area My best description for all the food is classic The cold sesame noodles are by far better than any other Chinese food in its price range for sure Lets just say I don t keep any other Chinese menu s in my room And yes sometimes the food is oilly but sometimes it s oilly just right 
BQH7NurjQe98rSRDg9l9Tg CMU The decor is misleading this is fare just a step above Chinese takeout but when you re tired of other places in the area and don t want to eat Chinese at home or in a hot grimy shithole where the cooks scream at each other and everyone else is ordering chicken wings try Columbia Cottage 
Bs-vLAhZD3thYtzeJGMxDw CMU rude place 
Bst9ZNyMJCcCvs1QyYbLDA CMU I ordered a chicken with 3 mushroom in brown sauce which was A OK I wouldn t talk about the food as I haven t tried the other dishes and from the review out here is not that good I would like to talk about our waitress who would not be at a more bad mood I friend was soo scared of her that he ended up ordering something else I heard that the workers are underpaid which explains it When we asked her to get some sauce she blasted at us and told us to be more specific in a very rude way I only time she seemed sober is when she handed the bill We gave her the required 15 tip to avoid being followed by the waitress with a knife For a some reason the dishes get expensive by couple of dollars for dinner I heard these place gets packed at lunch time during weekdays We went on a holiday so did not take us much time to get our dishes 
C08WqpOm56DXjnEmDaUQlw CMU When M2M didn t have the ingredients I needed to make pad kee mao I walked to Ollie s in the heat of the hunger Highlight of the night it took about 3 minutes between ordering and getting my food That s the best thing I can say about the place Servers grunted threw a salty pile of chow fun with vegetables i e huge pile of greasy disgustingly salty noodles with rare shavings of carrot and onion on the table and never checked back until the bill came At one point after trying to make eye contact with them as they loitered by the kitchen I had to shout to ask for more water When the bill came it was 9 75 I put in a ten and went to leave I have only respect for food servers and normally tip 20 30 These guys surround me and start telling me that the price was for food only and does not include mandatory service fee I pointed out the many reasons I wasn t giving them a tip and felt like taking the quarter too Wish I would ve checked yelp before trying this shithole 
C0uH5dfZ3Sb9tsJ6Ft-v5A CMU This place can look a little sketch from the outside especially considering some of the surrounding businesses but inside it is very clean and quaint and the food is excellent The dumplings range from plain and mediocre to f king phenomenal Overall they probably deserve a 3 5 star rating HOWEVER the Shrimp Pork dumplings and the Chicken Green Pepper dumplings are so good that I give it 5 stars overall I ve never actually sat down and compared these dumplings with the ones at Oriental Garden on Elizabeth side by side but they definitely rival each other and top my list in NYC This restaurant now also has standard American lunch fare which also seems to be quite good 
C3IrieugUaQlRpfVSCwMWQ CMU I may be in love I have hooked up with my first neighborhood Chinese restaurant and I liked it We went here on our first night in our new apartment for our usual two orders and were not disappointed Wai Lee delivered in excellent form cheap yummy and filling for about 45 minutes We will be back at least until we try one of the other 5 places on our block 
chjx8X342KjiafeqCT7hQg CMU I ve eaten here 3 days in the past week The shrimp pork dumplings pan fried of course are AMAZING I ve also tried the pork cabbage and vegetable dumplings they re ok but the shrimp pork ones are their best Wasn t a fan of the scallion pancakes a bit too salty for my taste I d rather eat at the restaurant than have it delivered seeing as how they forgot my request for hot sauce hot oil when they delivered You just can t eat dumplings without hot sauce 
CIj-MchwTsWLNC-4oB8lfw CMU two words FREE WINE I ve never been to a place that gives you free wine with your meal For that reason alone you should come check out this place But their food is pretty good too I was visiting some friends in morningside heights and they suggesed this place for dinner I don t think they had ever been there either they just heard about the free wine So we all just ordered our own meals which I do not suggest The dishes are fairly big and beg to be eaten family style So talk it over with your dinner party order what people want then share the wealth P S the wine is white so enjoy the food and drinks 
CITuooLY4qY_s34RjDwn7g CMU I ve been going here with my family ever since I was about four or five years old and we know the manager personally Every time I come back to visit we all have to go for at least one night I m not sure if you New Yorkers really get it Example Someone down this review thread commented that the food is just a step above Chinese takeout Where I come from what I have to compare this to this statement could be no more far from the truth But then I have to remind myself that New Yorkers are spoiled with A LOT of good chinese food We have a splatter of chinese places back in santa cruz that I ve been so disappointed with that I ve given up on just about all of them with the exception of our local rice and noodle bowl shack It would seem to me that if you actually repeatedly eat from a place and drink their unlimited wine you d have the decency to give the folks at least three stars Things I can t live without when I m ordering Hot and Sour Soup Shrimp Dumplings and Peanut Sauce I actually dream about eating these from three thousand miles away And last night we enjoyed an awesome platter of Duck with Ginger and Scallions and Broccoli and String Beans in Garlic sauce The veggies always seem very fresh and never over cooked Check out their veggie vegan options The menu also has many authentic un americanized options to choose from 
cJvcazRWkeH1f9cycDbyHw CMU Columbia Cottage is great for a quick asian meal whether on the go or in the mood for a sit down meal The crowd is usually a mixture of locals and Columbia students but the atmosphere and service are good Portion sizes are good for one person I usually get my food take away and end up having left overs 
CkJVY41sEMI3v4B8WCw64A CMU The price is JUST right Honestly it is your standard cheap chinese take out place Absolutely nothing special here I ordered the Chicken w broccoli combo once and it was pretty good Nice sauteed broccoli good sauce The chicken was not that great however The pork fried rice that came with the combo was extremely greasy and had hardly no pork or brussel sprouts in it I might as well have gotten white rice instead Another time I ordered some chicken wings This was actually pretty good and extremely cheap so I will probably order them again Please dont expect anything special when ordering here If you do prepare to get disappointed 
CqUntEm7fPhgH7Ygt_wYqg CMU Just when I think I m never ordering from this shabby place again they keep pulling me back in 
cTfVeXHegU2YlzvK65cH2A CMU MMMMMMM i am cramming for a midterm and craving Wai Lee s tofu and veggies right now anyway back to the food ive had veggie lo mein my bf has ordered chicken lo mein beef and broccoli and ive also ordered the egg rolls yumm and vegetable noodle soup really good flavor and fresh veggies all really tasty and great for the price AND they have a ton of vegetarian options i m not calling this authentic chinese food i will say that this is definitely the best of the chinese american that i have eaten around here best of all they deliver within 15 minutes its actually spooky bc you put down the phone and it seems like they ring the door bell a minute later 
cu4ls54IFmRnEUvTnT_K9g CMU should add i stopped in for a tea to go i rated it badly cause of bad service and now i understand why when you re in the area walk to the cash register and look at the sins i mean signs posted on the wall to your right it is their labor rules regarding payment preposterously low pay i imagine coupled with bad treatment 
cV0OFRuQK7899rnX4-gPIA CMU Yes best chicken lo mein ever Sooo good Definitely worth the trip to Harlem just to get a fix 
cvi2KYREpw172xgUiSBWcw CMU fast and reliable and not esp expensive food wise don t go in expecting much service is just notorious 
CX2vje1e7dD9YoqFRGQghA CMU I echo others Meh s There s a reason why I never think twice about traveling downtown to Chi town for dumplings The uptown trip here isn t worth it The dumpling skins were thick and gummy and the fillings lacked flavor I mean they re passable but they re not something I d ever choose to order and eat What a shame 
CYvJbkLTgo4oQeAFrVRpQw CMU Cheap restaurant But too much salty and oily some of the dishes are nice there 
D5_WEIXcGIFP-p7bNAxA0w CMU The following are good from this place Shrimp chicken or beef broccoli Shrimp or pork fried rice egg rolls boneless chicken chicken wings onion rings any type of lo mein sesame chicken spare ribs i always order the same but i believe any of their food would be good i just never had the curiosity of ordering something different I ve always ordered from here since i was young This place will always be my go to for Chinese take out i always try different places but for some reason i come back to Wai Lee Despite the fact people think this place is dirty etc guys believe me its the same owners i ve been eating here for the past 15 years lol if that helps I never regret eating from there except for when i do feel bloated and fat haha 
daWsV11IspOA_dfzvPfaYg CMU 2 5 stars Maybe the reviews made me expect more from this place One thing it does have going for it is the cost Its cheap I ordered 3 small dishes pork fried rice pork and broccoli and kung pao chicken and an egg rol and it was 16 50 The small size is pretty large so that is nice too But The food is pretty meh The pork fried rice was alright but only had pork no added vegetables as I usually expect The pork and broccoli was decent as the pork was nicely cooked and was in thin slices The kung pao was straight up awful I mean just worthless Don t order it I know im ordering Americanized Chinese food so I m not expecting world famous chicken but come on at least serve decent chicken Maybe I ordered wrong but I dont know if there will be a next time from this spot Sadly I don t know how many other options there are for delivery in this part of the UWS Oh well live and learn 
dgsO8M4UryBo5IfhlFRnCw CMU They just installed a new awning and an exterior door to prevent cold winter air from entering so I assume the chill is fixed 
dOlUQKz7y7NAgWmxeVu4aw CMU When choosing stars for this one I had trouble am I comparing Ollie s to every quality Chinese restaurant in the city Or to cheap late night take out joints Because if I was going for the former this would come off as a fairly snooty review about how awful and mediocre and terrible it is But for the latter Ollie s definitely delivers General Tsao s Pork Fried Rice Beef with Broccoli all is decent enough and much better than Columbia Cottage which on appearances seems like it should be far superior and yet really sucks Delivery is quick and yes the service is rude But the prices are cheap and the food reliable 
DQ4YpEdC8XTkeIqBWe10IA CMU They have delicious dumplings i order from them it s always quick and steamy hot fresh Scallion pancake was chewy and tasty but Korean style potato pancake was very different from what it should be don t order that 
dS6EDePrS5LcyYzqkiULIQ CMU I discovered this gem of a place getting my Taxes done two year ago Located just off the corner of 106th st in Manhattan there dumplings are out of this world My personal favorite are the Chicken and Corn dumplings But the entire menu is really good The food is fresh and you can even buy dumplings frozen to take home 50 Dumplings for 20 bucks is a bargin in my book 
dwuw0DH1EBLDnt3YfT4q_A CMU Columbia Cottage is a perfectly decent no frills spot People who are into fine Chinese cuisine would most likely not want to eat here but i don t think the food will insult their palettes For everyone else know this the service is quick and on point Their brown rice is yummy Especially accompanied by the Spicy eggplant MMMM lunch Which reminds me they have a lunch special menu that makes absolutely worth it I wouldn t come here for dinner Here s a tip they give you more food for takeout than sit down 
dX10Kvlz-mZtfMh-I_vatg CMU Unbelievably cheap and really tasty But beware these things are filling The dumplings were fabulous other food is adequate 
e-JvT8XF6vT0Dn1_Eg9eOQ CMU I ordered from this place using seamless web It took an hour and forty five min for me to get my food I called after waiting an hour and I was told it would be there in a few mins it came forty five minutes later My little juicy dumplings were dry and crusty The house special lo mein tho I had requested to spicy was very bland and extra greasy even by bad chinese food reaturant standards The only reason I gave it two stars is that miraculously it came piping hot after 1hr and 45mins from placing the order There was absolutely no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long what so ever If this place had the last morsel of food in the entire state of NY I would start eating my left nut before I ever would order from them again You ve been warned 
e1pBh4fUyrQ-HvVvQ8NOVg CMU Just ok Nothing special Same old americanized chinese takeout place cheap prices decent portion I like Elsa G ordered the szechuan chicken and it wasn t spicy at all I should ask for it spicy next time This place will do on occasion but only because i have a soft spot for mediocre chinese food 
e6dJNFG9MICm-0aJD_knyQ CMU Definitely go here again Fast service This is where you go for cheap delicious Lo Mein This is my Chinese Food Joint in Morningside Heights 
E6rP1RLsWifN_2Kf7vt72Q CMU Cheap Harlem Chinese food There seems to be an over abundance of these hole in the wall type places but Peking Garden is a good bet if you find yourself in the neighborhood The food isn t incredibly good but the flavors are noticeable ie the food isn t just unrecognizable mush plopped in a container with too much salt and that plastic cheap flavor and the portions for the price are very good My favorites here are the vegetable lo mein and the shrimp rolls pretty standard and safe fare Worth a try if you re in this neighborhood and don t want to break the bank on a quick meal 
eFrJm3EJy8dxRA1QxPC0aA CMU Horrible Horrible Horrible Avoid at all cost I swear that the dumpling I received would bounce it is so tough and rubbery the scallion pancake was burnt on the outside and raw inside The man that answered the phone when I called to complain had nerve enough to tell me that this is what traditional Chinese food tastes like Well as someone that has attended traditional Chinese banquets I beg to differ This was the worst food Horrible awful inedible Order at your own risk 
eHEMepo9HSB-_PISDsNXvw CMU Ridiculous food and price Thanks to so many Yelpers who agree this 
eISsxXCkiNNhnF3s1v4KAQ CMU this place west place definitely isn t your generic chinese place unless ordering crawfish pig feet and seaweed for lunch fits that bill to you it s all about their 5 95 3 entree rice soup lunch combo where you can choose items like the above or of course some general s chicken teriyaki chichen etc etc etc items seem to be on a rotating schedule 
EkKK_WTbV6tNa7R1qsRrxg CMU I ve been coming here now for so long I m ashamed to admit how old I am A consistent reliable standby for quick chinese whether eating in or doing take out Stick with soups dumplings and noodle dishes then thank me 
ERo8jFnmi3YUu7Oixg8Mkg CMU For my first anniversary with my boyfriend we stayed in and ordered Wai Lee I kid you not We ll have spontaneous dinners at Nobu and outrageously decadent multi course tasting menus at Momofuku Ko but when it comes to celebrating special moments Wai Lee holds a special place in our hearts The beginning of our relationship was filled with lots of studying over Chinese take out from Wai Lee It s no wonder why years later we often like to revisit that familiar feeling and take out place Then again the sweet and sour chicken is also just really freaking good I m sure other places have similar sweet and sour chicken but Wai Lee is consistent and I ve never been disappointed They ll put the red cornstarch loaded sauce in a separate container to prevent the fluffy fried nuggets of chicken from getting soggy I imagine we like the sweet and sour chicken so much because it reminds us of chicken nuggets Bite sized and crispy they are somehow not oily at all even though anything fried is far from healthy Soooooo good I always get a combo platter Eggroll pork fried rice with a Coke General Tso s and sesame chicken are both standard edible stuff but this is still the best Chinese take out in the area Whatevuh Anniversary or not I love this place I m in a relationship with three other people Saji s my boyfriend and Wai Lee are all recipients of my irrational wild love so take the five star rating with a grain of salt 
ETBU5awSUE7c5rz-5aOdEQ CMU East Dumpling House is a small restaurant on 106 near B way south side with a wonderful limited Chinese menu Service is good and simple with free iced green tea if you go in and if you get delivery more than once they keep your name address in their system Dinner for two 25 after tax tip great deal for the quality Food categories appetizers dumplings soup noodle cold noodle and rice dishes Appetizers I love the Korean style potato pancakes they re like spicy latkes and that means oil and the ugly dumpling s tasty too I haven t tried the others but I d save my Eel craving for the rice dish and I can t imagine scallion pancakes compare to the Korean potato pancakes Dumplings steamed is best The three pork variations esp shrimp are excellent There s a vegetarian option if you re vegetarian And a chicken option if you re crazy Yes I tried the chicken one It has crunchy green peppers inside if that s your thing Haven t tried the Shanghai Wonton Unlike a lot of other places their dumplings don t skimp on fresh ingredients and ginger The sauce adds a lot of flavor So soak it up Noodle favorite two soup noodle dishes are the Bulgogi and the Pickled Mustard w Pork Vegetable noodle is simple kind of bland and fresh good for sick people If you get delivery the broth and the dry ingredients are kept separate again thoughtful and fresh Cold noodles are boring Don t waste money on those unless you need a non meat appetizer for a table and no one can agree on anything Rice dishes I ve only had the Eel Over Rice so far melt in your mouth eel with a sweet brown sauce but based on my experience with the soups I m looking forward to the Bulgogi Over Rice and I m curious about using the Curry Vegetables Over Rice as a shared appetizer 
EV7UuuroTRDmgImNyZ3ipw CMU This place isn t absolutely terrible but it isn t good It s passable if you are very close and do not feel like cooking The prices are alright especially for New York but the place is dirty The people are not terribly friendly either The past couple of times that I have gone in it has also taken way too long to get my food Walking six extra blocks to Empire Szechuan on 100 Broadway for better food and only about 1 2 more price wise is a much better option 
Ey7eyPItgDVK5LzSi_Z7Kw CMU Restaurants around the Columbia area are generally not very good and Ollie s is just one of them They do have a couple of edible dishes and we go only on days when we re studying very hard in the library and have no time to go anywhere else The ladies in the front are really mean but the waiters are okay 
eytpcEsBZ4D2VJz2po0N6Q CMU Dumplings are close to my heart they remind me of cold nights shivering in my apartment in Seoul with a heaping pile of dumplings and a large bowl of white or fried rice to keep me warm Therefore eating dumplings is always a zen like almost religious ritual I have passed by East Dumpling House more times than I can remember but always vowed to step foot to test and enjoy the magical ness that are dumplings I tried my best not to compare these dumplings with Vanessa s down on 14th st but it was hard not to I ordered the combo chicken and shrimp dumplings and dove in The dumplings themselves were pan fried nicely and had a delicious and subtle chiveness to it The accompanying sauce was mild and did not have enough salt to it In ending I greatly enjoyed the dumplings and found the small nook of a restaurant and the kind servers as a perfect compliment to a delicious bowl of inexpensive dumplings I ll definitely be back 
Eztzb8VEVLpEpnqxtCdE6g CMU Come on CU students why do you insist on keeping this place open I used to go here 20 years ago and the food was kind of gross I was shocked to see them still in business now and the food still is less than mediocre Don t forget to ask for NO MSG if that s important too cause its loaded here 
eZUz_M4Cq_6pqX4q5eNdUA CMU Listen this place is great for one reason and one reason only They give you free unlimited wine until you finish your entree I first ate hear last July pre Yelp GASP and I made a FOOL of myself Long story short I was having guy issues who doesn t and I was piss drunk by the time I was halfway through my spicy beef entree I broke a couple of glasses Sure the employees looked at me funny and I embarrassed my friends but I had a great time right I eventually ended up in Midtown walking in the street in my underwear hitting on some guidos Flash forward to last February I decided to go to the scene of the crime and had an equally amazing time Granted I wasn t quite as much of a hot tranny mess as I was the first time I still enjoyed myself I didn t even manage to break anything The food is really good but FREE WINE I can t stress that enough So what if it s boxed wine it s unlimited people You too can be a train wreck on a budget 
E_0qtof0a-SnZ04HqRxG4g CMU I d rather have Panda Express Its overpriced for chinese food and not worth it For some reason I always come back hoping for a better experience only to despise Chinese food the following day If you have a craving ignore it or head to Chinatown where there are better options 
F2jVHfoWRZ33prELMUYl3Q CMU Gross food and rude service Why is this location so much different from the ollies near lincoln center 
F8bu1mH-35vWoXGBvNqm1Q CMU Worst restaurant ever 
f8Kf1lsEfhzwXvmvxhErGw CMU I m reviewing Ollie s as I reminisce about my Columbia days and have a serious craving for their Basil Fried Rice It s the best fired rice I ve ever had After I graduated from Columbia and lived in Washington Heights I would still make trips just for the rice Now that I m in NC I ve been experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms since I haven t found any rice that comes remotely close I even considered flying up to NY just to appease this craving Overall it gets 2 stars because I think the food overall is a 3 although the fried rice is 5 but the service is at best a 1 5 on a good day 
f9NPIzewi4P_qvwhp_fu6g CMU So I ordered chicken lo mein and the chinese cabbage its typical greasy chinese fare but that s what i craved The two stars isn t so much for the food as the service and it was a delivery The delivery driver called me to come down stair and on my way down which probably took two minutes MAX he apparently called my phone again Oh when I finally got to the door he shoved the bag in my face and walked away very rude 
FeOOLBRJFvxdeEvkROBe8w CMU If greasy chinese food is what your stomach craves then look no further The fried rice is good and the General Tso s Chicken is not bad either Though it s not the best chinese I ve ever had but it will definitely hit the spot I just finished an order right now Oh no the itis is slowly taking over argh zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
fFmAhCQ9JtLtkd_1QEif1g CMU This place is what it is Cheap delivery chinese Sushi is less than average Still order from time to time as it s convenient online This was before I found Thai Season delivered MUUUUCH better sushi Also the delivery guy will always call and tell me he is downstairs 5th floor walk up Nice try dude I m not walking down the 5 flights to pick up the food you are supposed to deliver to my door Walk your ass up and i ll give you 25 
FHR7c_vHk5EvRFaic6gksw CMU Very good food not expensive and friendly 
fJpP0HDdPf-exSsQJgZntg CMU There was a time when I took my classmates out for a treat The waitress ruined our whole conversation she did not know how to split a bill We left with angers and dissatisfaction It is designed to get traveler s money there are better restaurants in Morningside neighborhood 
FJsISAqasWOfSDs6E5OZAg CMU Just an update to inform that this place no longer has a B but an A so my previous review is no longer valid It only has 13 violation points which is very low for a cheap chinese place Looks like they cleaned up their act 
FllqDQN5LwMJDeo2O_qqxA CMU Some of the reviews below describe really horrible meals a staple in a wonton I ate here frequently in grad school not because they serve the best food in NY but because it was on campus and kind of cheap Besides who has time to cook with all the studying Only thing I ever had here spinach wonton and fresh spinach soup with spinach noodles At 6 50 it was a steal enough for 3 meals And with ginger it was quite delicious and I think healthy 
fRYPD83MuG8JdNqx-8YuAA CMU Not too impressed by the pan fried dumplings here They were pretty greasy the skins were too thick and the fillings ranged from bad to acceptable All around the dish was lackluster I guess if I want good jiaozi I m just going to have to wait until I have time for a trip downtown The inside of the restaurant was nice and clean though 
FULr8xJqsvjZvDKtsS3SQQ CMU When I ve eaten here twice their lemon chicken tasted like bitter lemons and the chicken was dry I ve had their hot and sour soup and it was just wrong I don t recommend eating there but who knows maybe I came on bad days 
fXEXvPtwE8BnXI50n9r4bA CMU If you re thinking of dining in the restaurant don t This place should be strictly delivery The atmosphere inside is not pleasant but delivery is always super fast and the delivery guys actually know where they re going within Morningside This is great of you re ordering from an office or academic building which most people on the neighborhood do Not too greasy but not authentic Chinese food either 
FxwXTA1h6RMvtVbJQKDuRg CMU The food here is really good and the portion sizes rock Plus its totally cheep Basically this is my new go to Chinese take out place The only issue The wait staff SUCK They are literally so rude it is actually shocking My friend and I went in there for lunch the other day and were later joined by another friend after ordering The late comer wasn t hungry but she wanted some bubble tea so she asked our waitress to bring the drinks menu The waitress who had seemed annoyed enough before now gave us one of the dirtiest most evil looks I have ever seen and made such a big nonverbal fuss about this request that once she had gone the lady at the next table and I kid you not leaned over and said to us Well girls I hope you like spit in your food So my basic message is good food good prices never tangle with the staff 
FY1_riFFXuQo7ydHGyPCvQ CMU I couldnt believe that a place would give out free wine with dinner had they never met me At any rate this place passed the litmus test for me The test is If I see alot of asian people eating in an asian restaurant I assume its decent food Thats safe right I digress The fried dumplings here are awesome It comes with this peanut hot oil dipping sauce that is killer Overall decent chinese relatively inexpensive and of course Free Wine 
g-Xv7Cs6WooKLziPKymskA CMU I can only speak about delivery I ve never dined in But the food we ve had delivered is so so bad It is hard to go wrong with cheap Chinese food Expectations aren t high and virtually every place I have ever ordered from satisfies the craving But this place is awful I actually tried it twice the first time I thought we may have caught them on an off day since other reviews were OK Both times the food was SO bland that it was almost inedible Yuck I will never order from them again 
g3TsrwLuHfC7n5vV_PR3cA CMU The food s OK I have ordered delivery a few times just because I didn t feel like going out to get takeout Have to say though the main reason I won t order from this place again is just that the delivery guys are kind of rude They make a big deal out of standing there counting the tip which just kind of bugs me because I tip pretty darn well The first time I ordered the guy actually came back and knocked on my door after the delivery and said This tip pointing angrily at the receipt I had given him 15 percent but apparently he d read it wrong he looked again and said oh and then just turned around and left Kind of embarrassing because I had people over that night Plus twice the delivery guy has stood at my doorway and argued with me about why I don t have more light I DO have a porch light and I m a tiny little woman not some big scary menacing dude or something I get dinner delivered because I do NOT feel like drama that night people So no more from this place Empire is just as good for my mediocre greasy but kinda tasty Chinese food needs 
Ga8TmpNWo5iEz7UuFzzbFQ CMU went here on a saturday and it was packed with students and families The food was quick tasty and well priced We tried the standard american chinese cuisine when we were here We def want to go back and try some of the odder things on the menu 
gDDzkfp66SVVQDwsKaW_TQ CMU I have no idea what some of the other reviewers expectations were but clearly they are not Chinese What exactly do you expect from a hole in the wall where dishes are only 6 On Manhattan island of all places This is authentic as it gets Right down to the rats running around the back of the kitchen Maybe they grew up eating Chinese food at P F Chang s too much as a child but this sure as is what real Chinese food is like Dirty greasy and cheap The only thing that could have made this more authentic was if an old toothless Chinese lady was screaming at you from behind the counter in some incoherent bastardization of Chinglish Oh yea the chicken and shrimp with bbq pork fried rice is pretty bomb bbq pork fried rice at no extra cost You know assuming you re not a tightasswad who has no idea what real Chinese food is suppose to be like 
gDYHiLLi98QcHBkOotEfJg CMU There are at least 7 storefronts that house Chinese restaurants within a 2 block radius around here none of which are permanent and all of which are mediocre I want places to stick around as there s often more for rent than open signs in the area I try so hard to like each place but they re all mediocre at best Peking Garden does however do the best job food wise Service wise however is a different story at Peking Garden customers receive hand head gestures while employees deserve full stories and extended time with the counter help Inquired about their very limited Student aka lunch Specials went with the mixed vegetables Fried Rice with rice soup Hefty portions just enough flavor certainly cheap 
gEALECPj_uyXmOHm3NCl_A CMU It is cheap by manhattan standards at least 7 50 for sweet and sour chicken egg roll and fried rice The actual chicken was decent but they gave me an entire tub of fluorescent red sweet and sour sauce which I m going to say stank I was also pretty sketched out when people came in and ordered fries which made me wonder if my combo was going to taste more like a happy meal The egg roll strangely had a smoky aftertaste and the fried rice was ok but the pork in it was dried out I definitely have had better Chinese take out in manhattan and with so many choices it ll just take some time to find one in Harlem 
GGIV106VOgbKavgTRMEJ_A CMU Thank goodness I paid online and said I ll pay tip by cash The food actually came WAY faster than I expected which was less than the hour The guy was of course not talkative I gave him a tip of 5 bucks on less than a 15 bill and he still seemed disgusted Wah Anywho I got the sweet and sour pork and a shrimp eggroll The sweet and sour was basically flavorless and not appealing The shrimp eggroll you don t even taste the meat All you taste is cabbage So disappointing 
gilUhAsNgEnuabU7d9Zf9g CMU Ugh So I tried a new Chinese food place Big mistake The food just wasn t good I ordered chicken it was really stringy I guess they re not using a good quality chicken I ordered calamari the smell of fish hit me as soon as the food crossed the threshold Ummm yuck 
GM1ZuNIjNCXXcfExj6qGPQ CMU Me You want to order dinner Roommate Chinese Me Ok lets do ______ ________ Roommate Nah lets do up on 109th Me Awwwwwwwwwww I ll play you for it I rolled a 6 in cee lo and he rolled triple 5 s His steak with fried plantains were pretty good but the Chinese is just the cheapest and lowest of quality The prices are the only good thing going on Everyone s review on this place are great by the way 
gmdCe8axId_l1b9QJ2Yixg CMU As a former UWS resident take out service is a big part of what I eat on a daily basis As a consumer we look for communication on initial order taste of food temperature and quickness of service Columbia Cottage hits the mark on all four key criteria points I would order Chinese as part of my rotation of take out restaurants I found the food to have a balance of flavors in true Americanize Chinese I pretty much order the standby dishes shredded beef or chicken dumplings pork fried rice lo mien etc Nothing fancy just good delicious entrees and appetizers I guess about 10 years ago friends recommended this place Their main reason for ordering was quick delivery They would tell us that food would arrive between 10 to 15 minutes I did not believe until I placed my first order and it arrived in 10 minutes or less It was hot delicious and very good for Americanize Chinese Yummy Delivery was always fast Lighting fast I only lived 4 blocks and one avenue over not very far I have placed orders at other near by Chinese restaurants and it has taken much longer in time Average delivery time 20 plus minutes 
gNlliTGDX0HX-XzDqXA1dg CMU The worst place to order shrimp I ve ordered shrimp dishes from them twice to take out and the shrimp has been terrible The first time I thought it was a mistake and today I ordered the shrimp and broccoli with white clear sauce instead of the soy sauce The shrimp was old soft smelly and even worst it wasnt cleaned properly some of the shell was still on the shrimp part of the shrimp had black spots almost look dirty I knew it wasnt the sauce because I odered a clear sauce with it I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt What a big mistake I decided to call them and tell them that I was returning my meal because I couldn t eat it The lady at the register didnt even question me she told me to order chicken or beef which means that she knew that the shrimp is bad She also told me the shrimp is soft to which I responded soft means really old and smelly She said we order it already clean I said why would you purposely order bad shrimp because that hurts your business if you can t order decent shrimp dont provided to your customers at all Who wants to purchased bad food I am giving one star because she gave me another lunch I chose chicken and cashew nuts and asked them not to overdo on the oil And that was ok nothing that would make me go back there I will stick to buying chinese food near my house which is much better I ordered sesame chicken from them in the past and that was not good either Their food tend to be very oil drench in oil and soy sauce 
gS7UF3BDRqdl7ByuJypvDQ CMU I think the food was great I only had 1 thing but it was great I went in for take out on my way home from class only had to wait like 6 minutes for my order The staff was nice friendly and the food in the restaurant looked smelled delicious They don t get the full 5 stars cuz they were a bit on the expensive side But I m making my next date take me there 
gSN76-S-ForwEjs23bfNdQ CMU This place exceeded my expectations I was expecting americanized Chinese food like where they use spaghetti noodles for chow mein but I was pleasantly surprised The food is pretty good I particularly like the basil chicken It has a classy vibe but it s still casual 
GSO9Dk8ea7Fsp7t2BzRwfQ CMU Four stars for the bubble tea only I actually like Ollie s taro root bubble tea better than Tea Magic or Cafe East especially Cafe East The food is better at Vine which is next door 
gSt8kPAXnY7_yPZ0zzBs1w CMU So I took the advice of fellow helper and ordered the lychees OK So what is the deal with the prepoked hole in the lid of the lychees Several places do this It makes it IMPOSSIBLE to get the lid off the of container w o shooting liquid all over the place If i want to suck the liquid out of the container via a small hole which I don t let me poke my own hole Yes great deal but bad execution Plus liquid leaks out all over the rest of the food I also ordered the I like eel roll took a chance on it with no description since it was for eel lover It was pretty mediocre and I ve uploaded a picture so no other yelper gets sucked in It was basically 4 pieces of a fat eel avocado roll wrapped in cucumber and topped with eel sauce Not worth 8 50 if you ask me For 10 Saji s has 4 pieces of eel sushi and an eel cucumber roll 6pc a much better deal for eel lovers Also the fried rice I got the second time around was half fried white rice like they just threw some white rice in the wok and didn t bother to fry it all the way 
GXub_oKAQbvXXXIwEOYuUQ CMU Not too shabby for delivery take out chinese food I had the Singapore Chow Mei Fun and it has a nice kick to it which I really enjoyed My friend ordered the Szechuan Chicken and it too had an appropriate spice to it So many Chinese places say the dish is spicy but it ends up being sweet or bland instead Not too bad here 
GxYxWmAP6eoxZib9mnJJDw CMU I wish I could have gotten to rate this place higher but being as me and my friend ordered delivery at 7 30 and the food didn t arrive until 9 30 from a whopping 7 block distance I would say that it wasn t worth the wait especially since we did not order a 4 course meal in which that would be the only acceptable excuse for such an atrocious delivery service time 
haBea0wBW95WdV2oLRNb6A CMU Worst service ever Really bad attitude to the customers and the food was really not good DISAPPOINTED AND FEEL SICK about the place 
HDv5mNprB2NkLiLAsIN0VQ CMU I love this new place It s tastefully decorated the food is great and the staff charming We tried several different kinds of dumplings and they were all great especially the pork with chives and the pan fried ugly dumpling appetizer I thought the peanut sauce on cold noodles was a little too sweet The iced tea there is very different and was excellent unlimited refills too 
hF5gR_GCUWuVB2PyKpZvOQ CMU It s cheap fast and reliable I love this place and YO they serve brown rice It s a typical Chinese take out joint with horrible English Sesame Chicken comes with a few pieces of broccoli with brown rice is my favorite If you re trying to get a combo special the SAME EXACT dish is General Tso s Chicken w o sesame seeds Fried Tofu is good I am not a fan of their oversized egg rolls UGH AVOID the chicken noodle soup bc they use that chow mein noodle and it tastes like cardboard It s a horrible place if you re trying to watch your weight health but that s why it s SO GOOD 
hfSLHn7vQJDl7ZXQtvcFnw CMU The food is reasonable nothing exceptional It is a students hub since its right out side Columbia University and their helpings are huge I find their noodles I ordered Chow Fun slightly over greasy with peanut oil drizzling literally from them Its fine when u want to have something different for a change but I would not recommend this place if you want to have something exclusive 
HJY3SrChY_IHFx_8BIQRMA CMU While a devotee of authentic dim sum and Chinese my guilty pleasure is the Americanized version The scarcity of Chinese restaurants in my area UWS led me to try this restaurant solely on the recommendations of Columbia students figuring they didnt have the time to sit down at Columbia Cottage for the free box wine The place is hit or miss In fairness it is clean which is more than can be said for most of these hole in the wall Chinese takeout spots Dry Sauteed string beans and pancakes good Eggplant Garlic and Egg foo yung really bad Crab rangoons great Fried fish foul So it s worth a try if you want Cheap chinese good sometimes really good 
hK3k8vsJTf__6HDMtstkOg CMU This place solidly comes through with perfectly fine chinese food for takeout when you dont feel like cooking or leaving the house I just the garlic chick platter which comes with pork fried rice and a fried egg roll Yummy for a good price I also got some vegetable lo mein for me and my roomate to split that s good as well Give it a try It s the best in the area that delivers p s my garlic chicken is real pieces oh white meat not all nastied up 
hmdPhXfTk9yKER417dvQRw CMU I want to like this place I really do There aren t many places if any to get dumplings in the UWS The dumplings themselves are pretty good BUT They have GOT to do something about the shoddy delivery service The first time Sent a Hispanic dude who doesn t speak English or read very well I m certainly sympathetic to the language thing but the dude rang the wrong buzzer even though it clearly said my apartment number on the receipt Some other dude answered and said I didn t order dumplings So the delivery dude just went back to the restaurant They didn t call to confirm or check in any way After an hour I called them to ask what the deal was The guy told me that the delivery guy said I didn t want it I told them that was clearly not the case and I wanted my dumplings very much thank you So they sent the delivery guy out again This time I heard the buzzer ring down the hall so I peaked out and saw the delivery guy waiting I buzzed him in as my neighbor clearly pissed was coming down the hall I apologized to my neighbor then turned to the delivery guy who was smiling like nothing was wrong I tried to explain to him what had happened but he had no clue what I was saying My wife then tried to explain in Spanish No dice I took my dumplings gave him a decent tip anyway and ate my dumplings Everyone gets one chance And the dumplings were pretty great The second time Ordered two 8 piece dumpling orders Told them that the last delivery guy couldn t get my apartment number right They assured me that they d get it right this time I gave them my credit card info as I had no cash on me and hung up After a little while the doorbell rang Success I thought I opened the door and was greeted by a smiley Chinese dude I got my dumplings and the guy said 14 75 I paused for a second then realized he thought I was paying in cash Odd So I said oh I paid with my credit card The delivery guy freaked out a bit and then realized that the receipt had gotten soaked in the rain and was unusable They delivery guy didn t know what to do and kept saying Very busy Cash over and over again He even called his boss back at the restaurant and had me speak to him Mr Boss explained that without the signed receipt they can t charge me fair enough so if I wanted it they would have to send the delivery guy back out to me Exasperated at this point I said no it s fine I ll figure something out Luckily my wife happened to have just enough to cover it so I paid the guy and ate my dumplings The second 8 pieces were undercooked Sigh All in all I m sure this is a lovely place to go when you can eat there I ve given their delivery two chances now Not sure I m going to give them a third 
hOVL4-RxXnW0YL3UrBVoFw CMU It may not look like much but it s way better than Szechuan Garden Kitchen down the street and still manages to be less ghetto looking The things that say spicy are actually spicy Plus they offer hot and sour soup with their lunch special and SGK does not The portions are massive and fed me for one full extra meal only costing 6 The guys are nice and asked me if I was Chinese In my broken Mandarin I said yes and asked them if they are from Fujian I guessed right But I don t understand the mainland Fujian dialect at all Only the totally different Hokkien that is used in Malaysia 
hqG7ZDSD10wIBIFMxRl_hg CMU This place is pretty decent My husband and I were nervous about trying it when we first moved to the neighborhood because of it s questionable appearance dingey We were pleasantly surprised when our chicken lo mein and sesame chicken were delicious It s not over the moon great but they have speedy delivery and are very affordable My husband goes back for the sesame chicken regularly PS Ask for extra rice if you like rice They never seem to give us enough 
HTWquZsV414CWRjODHyyIA CMU Service is really fast even during peak peak hours when its raining Fried dumplings Wow Truly an amazing amount of oil Like enough to lubricate an entire NASCAR team The tasted like normal chinese food dumplings but more the slimy greasy type than the crunchy fired type that I love Egg rolls Meh Pork fried rice Well the rice part is tasty but the pork itself looks more lie that stuff that chinese restaurants serve as imitation chicken Gummy and chewy and yuk But I can eat around it so whatever 
hyusPxDzXjbnqqBJ0ir-9g CMU Yelp wanted me to update my review on Ollie s I haven t been back since my original review which you should read if you want a good laugh but after browsing through and seeing all the recent 1 star ratings i can only imagine things haven t changed much since I last wrote So i ll end this update with Ollie s still SUCKS 
I-0kFYTpxt7N-bLk8Bb6BQ CMU Decent dumplings uptown though it is unfortunate that the gym sign next to it so obscures it s existence 
I54PaWBzHBQYID7SqRAeJw CMU Go here if you want a meal that will fill you up for under 10 but don t except a tasteful meal Service is very straight forward Chicken curry rice 
iAWiBoRFeUdpI5H05C90RA CMU I first noticed the small neon sign the other night as I was walking along 106th between B way and Amsterdam The words East Dumplings beckoned me with visions of steamed goodness What was this A new dumpling place on the upper upper west side Prayers answered Not wasting any time I walked in and ordered steamed pork dumplings with chives 12 pieces for six and change One bite reminded me of traveling around China in the early 90s when I ate dumplings every day for two months In subsequent visits to East Dumplings I ve tried the steamed shrimp pork dumplings my new my favorite as well as pan fried chicken dumplings with green pepper It s all fresh and delicious Throw in another 3 bucks and order the Shanghai Spring Rolls or Scallion Pancakes but I d pass on the Spicy Noodles I ve had way better Stick to the jao tse at the East Dumpling House and you can t go wrong This place is awesome 
IbwlBVebnit4Xxsn3d3nWA CMU One of my favorite restaurants of all time I graduated from Columbia 5 years ago but still trek to the UUWS at least once a month for this amazing place The food good better than most cheap Chinese places I also love their Steamed Dish that comes in a fun bamboo box It s healthy and filling Their scallion pancakes are delicious and for the more adventurous they have a Szechuan and Hunan section with more authentic dishes The place is always full of real Chinese peopl a good sign so I assume they get those items right More importantly free all you can drink wine YES free and yes unlimited The staff is friendly fast and generous As long as you aren t falling on the floor puking they will keep bringing you wine and for that the Cottage will always have a piece of my heart 
iCRp2egFuT-04ikWKATZGw CMU The staff are very polite Even when the place is packed with students and business people alike for the lunch special the workers manage to stay friendly and cheery The food is the standard American version of Chinese food A little greasy but okay The fried rice is made with yellow rice so I prefer the white rice You must specify because the fried rice is standard 
ie7YhkEoDiPJ5K2IteZA0Q CMU I never understood why there were so many people inside Ollie s on any given weekday during lunch I came here twice First with friends for dinner and another time for the take out lunch special Both encounters were surprisingly mediocre but not unpleasant First time I was there sitting down they kept ushering us to make our minds up and to order I can understand that get the business going Second time I was there the service was fast what kind of service was there I just ordered got the food and left The lunch special is a deal though You get your choice of meat vegetable with brown or white rice and with a choice of soup egg drop wonton and hot and sour All this for 6 8 Not bad for lunch The food however makes me confused I m used to home cooked Chinese meals and I m used to legit Chinese food in Chinatown and I frequent Chinese take out with my friends so I m familiar with that too but Ollie s just makes me really puzzled as to which category it belongs to It s definitely not a home cooked meal but the way they prepare the dishes are so different from Chinese take out and Chinatown Chinese food It s almost Americanized And I thought Chinese take out was already Americanizing Chinese food Weird Bottom line Don t come here expecting authentic Chinese food But come here for a good lunch special Take out only 
iEckPZDO-edUlBH7BC4deQ CMU Not so bad but also not so good The basics are worth a go Try the items on the small window menu 
ieMsiHWFtkv9wRi74fERAA CMU Don t do it The food quality is awful The flavors are all off The food has a bad after taste The food has a terrible odor like cat pee or something There are barely any vegetables in a vegetable dish it s just all noodle And the dumplings are all noodle SAVE YOURSELF TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE 
iEVd-7QJ4Q3Rgu62O0subQ CMU For the most part serviceable Chinese a step above takeout Intangibles make the grade There s the free box wine There s the 14 95 braised pork shoulder which seems to be about half of a pork shoulder skin on braised with a soy sauce based sauce It s great and can feed two people all by itself There s a few other more authentic than takeout dishes There s the service which is speedy enough and nice enough by Chinese restaurant standards Not worth a special trip but a worthwhile neighborhood choice Infinitely better than Ollie s 
iFFfpi_9NpcdQ57dArxBAQ CMU We order from them and this place was tasty I always crave dumplings and they hit the spot Not the best dumplings but the best you are going to get on the west side If you know a better place let me know The scallion pancakes were really good and the food is authentic 
iI-7eURlH0dmlAqvSRzDGQ CMU Awkward phone experience Hi when s the lunch special start uhhh uhhhhh errrr uhmmmm ehhhh hmmm uhhhhh urrrr uh 5 more minute K Stopped in 20 minutes later to be safe for lunch special takeout Had the mix and match for 5 95 The rice was dry and lukewarm but service was quick How and why meat made it into the vegetables scared me but everything else was solid not extraordinary but that s what you get for a meal and a half for less than 6 
ILvOq-XoYwgVWOhcBEWYHg CMU Since starting grad school at Columbia almost two months ago I ve probably already been to Ollie s well over a dozen times Why Simply put the portions are gigantic and the prices are low My favorite dish by far is the spinach wonton with fresh spinach and spinach noodle soup It s delicious and it generally unless I am completely starving when I go is two meals worth of food And it s only 7 50 so really not a bad deal Is Ollie s five star gourmet cuisine No not at all Also the service is pretty terrible except for take out which is surprisingly efficient However it s just fine and it s good value for grad students on a budget so I d recommend checking it out Note for people going with a group They only take two credit cards per check so plan accordingly 
Im9G9BW3EP_ZnfBPlHZxQQ CMU Not just bad criminally bad Literally I already knew most of Ollie s food sucked I was ok with that because I d found two things on the menu worth getting the sesame tofu and the veggie pan fried dumplings I was content to order just those two items and avoid the mediocre soups stir frys etc Tonight I called in an order of the dumplings for pick up When I arrived they were ready ready to hand me an order of mixed meat dumplings not veggie dumplings I was annoyed but not mad when you order Chinese food over the phone sometimes you get misunderstood It just happens Then the cashier phone person told me that I should speak more clearly Never mind that when she repeated my order back to me I heard her say vegetable through her mumblings Whatever I was content to just ignore her and pay for the veggie dumplings they were now making 6 75 said the cashier That was odd I thought weren t they less than that I paid anyway got my change and then pulled out a menu to check Vegetable pan fried dumplings 8 4 75 What the hell Aren t the dumplings 4 75 I asked the three of them behind the counter still open to the possibility I was looking at the wrong menu or something I really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt First they just ignored me They definitely heard me but just ignored me I asked again Taxes they say Tax isn t two dollars I said They whisper sometime to each other and then begrudgingly give me 1 25 That s still not what they should have given me but at this point I had had enough So there you have it Ollie s sucks at taking orders and they try to overcharge you out of spite 
iNET7P8ro6P5WVCHBVrHWQ CMU I went here on a recent trip to NYC I wasn t feeling too hot so I only ordered soup I got wonton soup my fav It was very good but I think it s kinda hard to screw up wonton soup well maybe you can I also ordered the honey green tea hot which was very very good Definitely recommend that if you want a nice hot semi sweetened tea It came in this tall glass with a pink straw Very cute I like stuff like that I would def revisit this place on my next trip to NYC 
iNYnQIu81mONL0MOguSE5Q CMU Probably my favorite place for takeout in the neighborhood The dumplings are SO GOOD and after many many orders I think only one batch of 6 came just slightly soggy The pan fried ones are delicious and feel less greasy than other friend dumplings The shitake mushroom ones are really unique and though I was pretty apprehensive about the dumplings with corn added to the meat those too are surprisingly great Also the service is very friendly which is a huge plus Came back to this review to add that the service is BEYOND friendly I ve always seen the same young woman at the counter taking orders and serving seated costumers and she is just wonderful She s always smiling and just kind of patient and friendly even when serving the rudest rudest group of 4 teenagers who were almost shouting at her and i m sure she wasnt expecting a great tip from this lot If they expanded their menu a bit this might be only go to for asian takeout 
Irw08Jf8Z1RWWGsKd2Q4Ow CMU It s cheap It s not actually as greasy as I thought The portions are huge Nothing is authentic but for 5 75 and so close to my house it s not bad and as authentic as Chinese food in the area gets sadly There s a semblance of vegetables in each dish usually broccoli The wontons in the wonton soup are laughable all skin no filling Try the egg drop soup instead Maybe my standards are getting lower but when I m in a hurry this place seems absolutely serviceable 
IykCD0h7RSuIeEcw1l3fBg CMU I ve read some highly critical reviews of this joint but I m must stay I m THRILLED that I can order from Ollie s I just found out they deliver up into Manhattanville breathed a sigh of relief I can finally get decent Chinese food delivered Sure it s not mind blowing but it blows my other delivery options out of the water excepting perhaps China Place which is not horrible but has nonetheless just been usurped for the position of preferred Chinese delivery They will deliver 20 blocks above or below 116th they ll store your address and credit card number and recognize you by phone number and they re polite and more easily understandable than most of their counterparts up here 
iz00i6GPjGm4hmkz1XMeDg CMU The Pork and chive dumplings and the Veggie dumplings were not as plump as I anticipated Still good though The dipping sauce spilled in the takeout container Didn t really need it They were pulverized Next time I will not not forget the Chili Sauce 
iz2oS3QGyKBHSLeFUD2yFQ CMU I don t know what all the complaints are about Sure not everything is good but lots of things are I m a fan of their veggie steamed dumplings nom And their garlic broccoli I always clean my plate Their fried chicken dishes aren t as good general tsos sesame chicken but hey that s why I don t order them Super fast service I usually order carryout 
j1bq03g52WSTnrd6fYElQA CMU I like Ollie s for their free tea and soup not their service I always feel like they are doing me a favor letting me pay to eat here Good cozy place to drop into if you need to pull away your visiting family and or friends from Times Square for a while 
J6Gsn-3Htbrrld-tgnrS0g CMU It s actually Taiwanese food rather than Korean Love the Basil Chicken with Shitake Mushroom dumplings and Pickled Mustard with Pork Noodle Soup Their Pork with Chives dumplings is also good even though I am not sure if western people will like it 
J6qlwhJ1WMqBgtlz4MeykA CMU Ollies Ollies Ollies You disappoint me so It s hard to avoid eating at this place when it s so close to Columbia but after the 3rd time of wasting my money here I d rather go as far as Flushing to get my beef noodle than to go back What a disaster this place is with their rude service and food The beef noodle is terribly oily the boba tea and pearls often soggy taste nothing like what it s supposed to taste like and overall Ollie s food is just too oily and salty Lastly don t expect this place to serve authentic Chinese If you like American Chinese you d probably like this place 
jd0XvdIy4EvOz75zQzRpkQ CMU Oh Ollie s you are so close to me yet you cannot satisfy You try with your too big portions large menu and exploitative labor practices Yet the moo shoo vegetable dish I had the other day just didn t taste right I kind of liked the mango veggie dish I must confess and I will likely come back for the veggie dumplings and vegetarian soup from time to time for a quick fix I could be convinced to add half a star if you would give me a fortune cookie after my meal but you never do 
Jd6hTZB5lJr8ofbnOx5GmA CMU Ollie s is fairly expensive for what you get 13 for Tso s and a soup Guessing they can get away with this due to the convenient location for CU Morningsiders and lack of local competition Ah well Entrees are pretty good Nothing to write home about Wanton soup tastes kind of buttery At first I liked it and now it comes across a bit odd This is where I go when I want Chinese takeout and am feeling lazy 
Jh-_YIE0i0U7zAMMNkfBvA CMU This place needs to use less oil salt and sugar Then it d be the perfect lunch you can have every day 
jlcAITMEg59kTe48hQRI-w CMU The food s meh It s a cookie cutter Chinese place what do you expect So onto why I m REALLY writing this review So I live in Harlem I m a goofy young white guy but most of my neighbors are black cause it s Harlem I live on a rather nice street in a rather attractive building populated by a wide range of age groups but it s mostly older folks So basically I m in a part of Harlem pretty indicative of Harlem in general and very far from the negative and untrue stereotypes that plague the area So I order GrubHub delivery from this place since I ve been testing out different cheap Chinese joints nearby and the confirmation says it ll arrive in a half hour A bit under an hour later I get a call from the delivery guy saying he was at my building and where was I I told him I was on the first floor just inside the front door and he said Ah okay be right there I wait five minutes and call him again First time no answer second time he picks up I ask him Are you sure you re in my building You have the number right I confirm details with him He says he ll be right there again Five more minutes pass and I get a call from the restaurant My delivery guy is waiting outside your building why haven t you gone to meet him Well I respond He said he was coming in I m on the first floor and can see the entrance I don t see him at the front door And then says the guy on the phone He says there are two black people standing around outside he s afraid he ll get mugged Go meet him So let s back up About thirty minutes before a boy and a girl from my building both barely teenagers were finishing up putting together a box for Goodwill from the building in the lobby outside my door Nice kids cool cause And then they went outside to wait for the Goodwill truck DUDE BLACK PEOPLE ARE NOT DANGEROUS SEND YOUR GUY IN SEND HIM IN NOW The restaurant owner was not happy with me A minute of my fervent insistence later he relented and ordered the guy over to my door which notably is only 30 feet and ten stairs from the street The delivery guy acted as if nothing had happened but I saw him sprint around the corner out the front door when he left Dear China place I understand some of your employees may have some negative preconceived notions against people with dark skin I understand they were likely brought up with these views and have never been asked to challenge them But I strongly suggest YOU challenge them NOW to re examine those views especially since you re based in such a diverse city where your employees WILL encounter black people Also should I mention the food gave me indigestion 
jmkiacxv7n617akQqvgb4Q CMU I love Ollies I really do which was why I was so upset when I left this location My dad and I decided we would have dinner here We ordered the scallion pancakes as an appetizer My dad order the sauteed vegetables and I ordered the orange chicken The scallion pancakes and the sauteed vegetables were pretty good I never tasted the orange chicken It never came I ended up having to share my dad s meal and cancelled my orange chicken order The one good thing was that our server was apologetic about it 
JmuAfPOVI8fduvuLSyZWqQ CMU Not a destination restaurant by any stretch but this is great value if you need take out in the area 
jnBLeR_-ogFqvUyYVHB7vQ CMU pork and shrimp dumplings bulgogi noodle soup and scallion pancake were all recommended by the waitress and all delicious I d go back and order the same things next time I loved the soup great broth and noodles with a bite 
JOk_trPfO0b_rYbwdatR5A CMU The dumplings are great but the menu needs more vegetable side dishes It s very skewed towards meats and rice 
Jp1VAs36D8ipCrZHibWh_Q CMU Just had my first meal at East Dumpling House and can t believe I didn t go there sooner I ve lived in the neighborhood for a year and usually stick to the same staples but this place is now at the top of my list EDH keeps it simple the menu offers a distinct cuisine allowing for a cohesive dining experience The physical space is small but nice with cherrywood floors and solid lighting The waitress was very nice and professional serving up our apps and main dish right on time I started with the Ugly Dumpling which was delicious all the way through give it a dump in the dumpling sauce for the full flavor experience For the main I got Wonton soup 8 pcs is more than enough awesome not to salty flavorful vegetable broth and big dumplings If you re in the neighborhood and want a quick inexpensive bite this is your spot 
JQxV4EOVMqkGsXcU1-qvug CMU Having been eating here often had everything on the menu Taste and flavor are generally good Pan Fried Ugly dumpling tasty authentic flavor Scallion pancake a bit greasy All dumpling dishes are good love pork and chive the best Great wonton soup the meat in wonton is a bit tough maybe using pork instead of beef will be more tender My least favorite and will not order again is Sesame Cold noodle it s not authentic Asian noodle it s over cooked Italian thin spaghetti the sauce is horrible my guest could not eat it It tastes like someone who s learning how to cook Flavor is well there s no flavor bland that I would not serve that to anyone and for 5 95 I would rather get a dumpling dish Tofu spicy meet sauce is ok Curry dish over rice is decent but they used bugolgi beef which can be tough I want to give 3 5 star because overall is not bad for quick week night takeout 
jy9-wAmZ8Slvy9ZdjAizNQ CMU Eh Not as bad as most Yelpers would have you believe but definitely the worst Ollies in NYC Basically lame Chinese food hiding under an Ollies label Definitely falls into the category of When you re broke and have no better ideas Not a destination And there are much better places in the Columbia neighborhood You won t die from salmonella if you eat here but skip it if you can 
kc6xPYNbE27lLYWb--RGDA CMU Best Chinese Food in the Columbia University Morningside Heights area All I have to say 
kCv-3dd8rRzpctz-hMmjAw CMU Got delivery from Wai Lee tonight and was pleasantly surprised Good American Chinese and not the super greasy stuff you often find The thing I liked most about it was the low price I ordered a small eggdrop soup a small shrimp lomein a small chicken with broccoli a spring roll and crab cheese wontons Needless to say it was waaaaaay too much food I thought the smalls would be small since they were ranging in 3 5 but they were huge I can t imagine what a large would be like I got all that food for 15 and it will definitely last me a few meals The shrimp lomein had plenty of shrimp which is rarely the case It wasn t overly greasy either which is often a problem The food was hot hot hot Even after a good 20 minutes of sitting on the counter The chicken with broccoli tasted fresh and wasn t bland like it is at lot of other places All in all I recommend Wai Lee but I caution you on the serving sizes Its definitely more than you expect 
Ko_Y7fdxEIYIojX7ssceBg CMU Just got some delivery from PG and the wife and I dug it The garlic chicken did not quite meet expectations as it was a little bland The chicken and veggies tasted fresh but we couldn t detect any garlic Still it wasn t bad The Mongolian beef however was a home run We were seriously impressed with it the meat was very tender and flavorful and the sauce had a nice spicy kick to it Oddly enough it was far more spicy than the garlic chicken which was highlighted in the menu as being hot The combo wonton and egg flower soup was pretty awesome too and contained especially large thick yet tender wontons Delivery was quick and the prices were very reasonable We ll definitely be calling again 
KS9QrZpfLHVB2WxXAGuf7g CMU 2 5 Tried the steamed veg and pork and chives versions The fillings aren t half bad veg was interesting and different from typical veg filling I liked the ginger Terribly inconsistent skins though all far too thick one of the veg dumplings had skin maybe 5 cm thick Pierogi have their place but that wasn t what I was looking for 
ktiP9kQdkAsWBdV3GwCRVQ CMU Ah the dumplings I am a dumpling freak and always looking for the most delectable For the upper west side Cottage is decent but I cannot say I have had better yet The shrimp dishes are tasty and you can t go wrong with the noodle soups PS Don t forget to bring your take out containers for leftovers Mother Earth will appreciate it 
kWnfxMJpRxSdv-7QB8HXQA CMU Service was very rude Food was boring and overpriced and not very good 
kX4N4wNONa5oA01WLhgA_A CMU Service Good Ambiance Good Food Good I expected more of this place because of the reviews If I was to go after dumplings I would head to chinatown or Good Fork in Blk The place is good and food decent but not jaw dropping 
kXVdyujToFG5uak6lk-VPA CMU It is the best Chinese restaurant around Columbia University much much better than Ollie s Every time I m craving for real Chinese food I ll get my friends and go there together So we can share the dishes since I m not satisfied by only one dish We love most the dishes on the last two pages of their menu 
kykBeMgZ6IdrnxWxonbGDg CMU I probably ate here once a week for three years straight in college but sadly enough i have no idea how their food is or how it compares to similar restaurants we really just went there for the free wine The sorority girl special steamed chicken and vegetables with some sort of sauce on the side served in a steaming covered bamboo dish was as good as steamed food can be Giving it three stars b c it will always be a great Columbia memory 
L0kWJhcdUPCPs41HYWrz2Q CMU I was looking for some quick and cheap Chinese food so I chose one close and got it delivered Delivery minimum was only 7 and the General Tso was good and enough for 2 meals Nothing special but I ll eat there again 
L9OyRumJMkaMx_dnEm_iAw CMU It s a cheap chinese take out joint You know the drill No surprises here BUT they are incredibly friendly on the telephone and really speak english well They intend to deliver very quickly and occasionally do Otherwise they apologize profusely I never have the heart to dock his tip Good place 
ladGhoLYv7DQLXgdC6tvMA CMU Very nice decoration Food was good Personable service Would go back again to explore more dishes since we had only a couple 
lCbg0raxfkz1NSbyKvFjNw CMU Did their dumplings get bigger I haven t ordered from them in a while the last time was when they first opened but it seems like they re larger now Oh well just an observation I can t attest to whether their food or service has improved over the years but the last order was delivered pretty promptly and the dumplings were decent though not outstanding Good value for the price 
leinNkC2NAh8zRyqkGgJgQ CMU W and I walked into this place after passing by and not knowing where to eat We didn t get the free wine because we didn t ask Like others have said it is passable Chinese fare I ordered rice cake with sliced pork and cabbage as I haven t had it in awhile It was surprisingly good and I was loathe to not finish all of it W also ordered some sort of crispy shrimp and it was pretty good as well The shrimp was tossed in some sort of sweet and tart sauce which I usually shy away from My favorite part of this place was this waiter that brought us our dishes He was a gruff asian man that told me to move my phone by tapping at the table I genuinely enjoyed his personal charm I only wish this place wasn t so packed to the brim we sat near the entrance with me facing towards the wall I had to move my coat and bag a bit since people passing by kept hitting my bag If I m craving passable Chinese near Columbia this is where I ll go 
lF_oUkbf8DHU8y8Qw5plsg CMU I d stick to the vegetarian dishes The vegetarian dishes are GREAT especially the vegetarian dumpling noodle soup with and the steamed dumplings 
LG0c03hg-cnRUUQum1ieNQ CMU How many stars do you give for heartbreak I had been to Columbia Cottage way too many times for low quality americanized chinese food It was fine for lunch if you just wanted something cheap and really hate your health Then one desperate day as I struggled to find somewhere to eat for lunch in the Columbia wasteland I checked the yelp reviews for Columbia Cottage and something caught my eye did I just see xiao long bao Seriously Suddenly I had expectations maybe there are actually two versions of this restaurant the one that pumps out mediocre americanized chinese food i e crap and the one that makes pretty good szechun food holy shit I was excited Well unfortunately even though they seem to be aware of the recipes used to make tasty Szechuan food they don t seem to care Lowest grade meat possible excessive oil all over the place unbalanced spicing I don t even know why I m analyzing the food I couldn t even finish it And the XLB I just can t even bring myself to talk about them don t order the soup dumplings the thought of bad XLB just hurts my heart 
LmxF4WRTV-ta1y2gj55g-g CMU Man oh man I live in Flushing but Chinese delivery from Columbia Cottage was way better than last place I ordered Chinese food from in Flushing I tend to order beef with broccoli when I can t think of anything else to order Needless to say I have had beef with broccoli from many different places Columbia Cottage s beef with broccoli was tasty and fresh 
LnmuwGYPNmjtHmGohOQcWw CMU Here s why i can never go to the cottage again Two buddies and I showed up there at about 7 o clock and by 8 30 we had each had two carafes of wine There were various sauces smeared all over the table along with a lot of grease spilled wine and general grime The table next to us wasn t really all that amused by us sending them a carafe of the free wine I ended up eating an entire roast duck somewhere in the mix as well All of us had passed out by 11 I tried to fight this one guy my friend actually made a bit of a mess and everyone felt like hell the next day Free wine disaster 
LOaLxwYmkAlJpHnrOWTEnw CMU General Tso s Chicken was pretty average but this place still deserves three stars for smooth communication and delivering a lunch special and nothing else 6 including tip in a speedy manner Also helps that broccoli was nice and green not gray 
lPICTbVgq-iCIOsV3bRTvA CMU good but bland but most chicken dumplings are am i rite cute place fascinating that it s in the neighborhood 
LtZd6A4ZmVssxBDJe36KKQ CMU Bad food even greasier than other Chinese fast food restaurants Pu Pu Platter had much fewer content than what it was served in other restaurants Szechuan Dumpling in Hot Sesame Oil was not enough hot I just felt they may reheat it for a little time before serving I won t come back again Even though the service is OK 
M5z08DDa3gtsgCKCV5WxmA CMU I consider myself a dumpling aficionado and these are some of the best I ve ever had The key to a good dumpling is a nice thin shell with fresh ingredients These have both If you order the chicken and green pepper dumplings you will hear the cook chopping the green peppers can t get fresher than that My favorites are the steamed pork and chive dumplings my mouth is watering just thinking about them Also don t miss the ugly dumpling The dumpling sauce here is excellent I don t know how they do it but I always want extra Although I wouldn t stray too far from the dumpling side of the menu East Dumpling House is a hidden jem in the Upper West Side You and your wallet will thank me later 
M6Ew_44bGJv4LBvgv1qP9A CMU We liked it We live in the area and this is a nice looking place so we went in We ordered the dry crispy spicy shredded beef and although it was good the description was nt accurate The menu said it was crispy spicy and dry and it was none of the above The service was great and appetizers Fried vegetable dumplings BBQ pineapple chicken were great as well For the price and a local chinese place why not try it We will go back 
MeLv9UPokPzSmfMjSG9ppQ CMU Good dumplings but there are land mines to avoid All the noodle soups are pathetic noodles are worse than unfresh dry noodles they are fresh noodles that got frozen and were not thawed properly So you get that gross starchy disintegrating taste in your mouth That said the dumplings are A OK You can probably make similar quality ones at home too but here the standard is different because well it s difficult to make a batch of dumplings It s a unique place on the west side it s really the most Chinese place in a 20 block radius random American Chinese takeout joints not included natch but quality wise it s not much better than a Quickly that s been modified to serve fresh dumplings They don t seem like they are doing well with eat in customers but they seem to service a lot of takeout orders Typical NY I guess everyone s too lazy to leave the house 
mjcT6NFKe96DG2jOMXGBxQ CMU The worst If you want to ruin your day go to ollies The servers treat you like youre being punished They wont smile say thank you or really do anything that is customary in western culture This place needs to close 
mlrPQNQXplr3weyo3vqAnw CMU Perfect greasy spoon Chinese Restaurant 
MODWlokRNOd24MJtzO1Sww CMU if i could rate this place less i would the most disgusting chinese food ive ever had in life yuck please don t waste your money greasy and gross 
mPR-kC0nBeI66BuiBVykMQ CMU This Ollie s has improved over the years I love the roast pork the pork dumplings and scallion pancakes It s a good place for take out but is often packed during lunch and dinner 
MSA6eygM_0VKdtiqGvt_kg CMU Passable Asian food around the corner from my place I probably would have never gone in if I weren t running out of options to eat around here The pad thai is pretty tasteless but I have to balance my starring for the vegetarian spring rolls which were divine I might come back only for the spring rolls 
muZfoikzunGYOSXu5ZNSuA CMU Honestly it gets worse every time I m here And I think finally FINALLY I ve decided to not return here again Keep in mind the first time I ever came here I gave it a four star review afterward I think in retrospect it s because the food is marginally better or at least I thought it was than the average Americanized Chinese take out However I think either I was dreaming and hoping for a great local take out spot since I was new to the area back then or maybe Panda Garden s quality has genuinely been slipping Either way The steamed vegetable dumplings last night tasted off at best It almost tasted like the vegetables were perhaps placed on a counter top and mixed with a cleaning fluid of some sort I mean this literally Bad food equally bad service from a miserable looking man who never smiles EVER and sketchy clientele don t waste your time 
MX4s5_IVggX-DhVZD9WLOA CMU sniff Yes I ve gone through another break up I am moving Consequently I am forced to call off my 9 month fling with First Choice chinese takeout up in Washington Heights She was consistent which is always a good quality in any mistress My rebound was Wai Lee and it was pretty decent for a spontenous rebound night I was thoroughly satisfied the entire night and there is even some leftover for a lunchtime quickie I may be in love Again 
n16QMelRIIfEP6tk3mo7CQ CMU I ve been to Ollie s twice and both times the food was fine Nothing special but fine However the service is horrid There were at least three servers just standing around in the dining room and it still took one of them a couple of minutes to come over and see if I was ready to order despite my use of the universal signal for being ready menu closed trying desperately to make eye contact Eventually a waitress wandered over and we had an exchange that went much like this Hi I d like the C18 please Uhn When my food came it was basically tossed on the table in front of me the waitress doing a 180 and speeding away almost before it hit the table The only time they were attentive was when it was time to collect the bill Terrible service aside I d give this place a 2 star rating if not for the fact that another waitress sat down a table a couple away from mine with two big bowls of raw ground meat I think she was stuffing dumplings but for God s sake don t you have a prep room in the kitchen Absolutely disgusting 
n53lfOnnybpYYo1LY280GA CMU For some reason whenever anybody suggests ordering from West Place I m always like uuugghhh I don t want Chinese but then we order anyway and then it s really tasty West place has super decent food and then the prices are crazy low And delivery is quick Not a lot of great vegetarian options but the ones with meat are always very good The sweet and sour chicken was particularly tasty Just do it you know you want to 
N5WDTJbi0Q6wzgDSp7Fotg CMU HHhmmmm so I guess this place is 3 stars because it was decent not great but decent I ordered the shrimp pork dumpling soup The broth was quite tasty but I feel the meat insides could have used more flavor I also ordered the scallion pancakes which were delish A little on the greasy side but I m a girl who doesn t dab her pizza if you know what I mean Service was also on the slow side delivery orders were going out 10x as fast as sit down dining Bottom Line I m not rushing back here but if a friend wanted to go I guess I wouldn t mind too much 
N6oOV_9unPZtklBySiMcsQ CMU The food is bad and the people are rude I know 2 people who have gotten sick from food here 2 people who have been shouted at to leave a bigger tip and a bunch of people who will never eat here again But of course I decided to order food from here because I was too lazy to go and get anything else Never again It tasted disgusting Just because the Columbia area doesn t have much doesn t mean you should settle for this 
N7T0cKsBj2NVNFg4mAvlIQ CMU Ok mind you that these four stars do not mean that this place in on par with high end places that would get a similar rating That being said Wai Lee excels in it s category of really cheap plentiful and actually tasty Chinese food As long as you are aware of this category of Chinese you will NOT be disappointed Also the person who usually takes my order on the phone is really nice and so are the delivery guys What more could you ask for 
nfP5BeSjqeCUOc0gO3LB_w CMU FASTEST CHINESE FOOD EVER Sit down and order within 5 min you get your food if you are on the run THIS IS YOUR PLACE ENJOY 
NFZuU-camULT8XuyInZwhQ CMU Oh man I am just addicted to their Wontons I didn t know why they refer Wontons to Dumplings in their menu It would be a little confusing Can you believe that I went there twice in a week just for their Wontons Recommendation Shrimp Dumpling with hot oil 12 6 75 Shanghai Dumpling with hot oil 10 6 75 Their service is also one of the best services that I ve received from Chinese restaurants in NY 
NgJM21HUSXnEJrcXXUncIA CMU The sesame chicken and general tso s chicken are horrible dishes small pieces of chicken not great sauce soggy I have had a few other dishes that are just okay Chinese food in this area is really lacking 
ngWA_0MfTm2WEakSHmg2gQ CMU Great shrimp and pork dumplings An order of 12 will set you back 7 95 plus a little extra for pan fry where they steam then lightly sear in wok Clean small maybe 8 to 10 tables of happy people as its dumplings and good ones in a light thin wrapper with a mild ginger soy dipping sauce The shrimp were perfect and the pork mix rounded them out nicely On top of this while my phone said 99 degrees outside their air was chilled for a great start to the weekend Yelpers thanks your reviews rarely lead me astray and this was no exception 
Nh2GqVZ5qZ_80jxmIygbnQ CMU Order from here to avoid falling into the Ollie s trap Still it s nothing to get too excited about Their lo mein tastes like decent lo mein the scallion pancakes are greasy and crispy and especially flavorful when dunked in soy sauce and the food is competently cooked all around But the sesame bean curd I ordered was way too sweet and no amount of brown rice could neutralize the taste of sugary something with a hint of ginger Prices are okay and the menu is extensive Delivery came in a ridiculously short amount of time All in all I d say it s earned its current three stars in this part of town one could do better but one could certainly do a lot worse 
nlDEyjGDZhFXYMHi7sUK1w CMU Cheap as hell and pretty good hey it s Chinese fast food You re not escaping the grease Always seems cheaper than it should be At lunchtime there s often a lineup of Chinese Columbia students out the door so that should at least tell you that it s not terrible 
NlFQJpyDxPxm0xwtzvZGng CMU Wai Lee knows its target market and meets its needs well Do not come here looking for a great meal in terms of taste and presentation you re sure to be disappointed In fact don t come here at all the one time I went in to pick up my food I was a little turned off because it is a dumpy little place This place is for all the college kids and young professionals like myself looking for a quick cheap meal The menu is pretty extensive and any classic you could be looking for is probably on there For about 7 bucks you can get basically any entree white or fried rice and an egg roll Throw in another 1 50 and you got yourself a soup 10 bucks for all of that after delivery and you re set You re not getting cheaped out either I ALWAYS have two dinners out a Wai Lee meal and I m stuffed after both On days that I m less hungry I can even stretch it out to three If you had a bad day and feel like going home lounging in your pajamas watching a movie or TV and eating some comfort food Wai Lee is the way to go 30 minutes and 10 dollars later you ll be set and you ll forget about whatever happened that day because you ll be in a food coma 
nMi3VkYms0MWsKlexMQacw CMU very good dumplings as good as the ones in Chinatown and flushing price is very cheap too 
nMJSpqRX_uG0aIjra8zj3Q CMU Bad Chinese food Don t bother 
Nx20z-_zD6AEj70c38h1Lw CMU For what it is a sketchy Americanized Chinese takeout place it s great It s cheap it s pretty fast if you order at the counter i haven t done delivery and it s tasty Bonus it s not overly oily like a lot of cheap Chinese food I don t know of any better place in this neighborhood because everywhere else either seems super gross or way too pricey 
nZbN7POnSOVr-RSas2b6uw CMU Wai Lee does a damn good job at what it does and what it does is deliver large amounts of cheap Americanized Chinese food to my apartment in 15 minutes or less Anyone expecting authentic gourmet stuff is not looking in the right place Who expects great food this fast and this cheap That said the service is great and the food is tasty not greasy or soggy like a lot of the other places in this area For American Chinese it s pretty good and the portions are extremely generous I probably order from here at least once a week and my boyfriend and I can have dinner for 12 tip Mmmm 
O22WgHapEo18vhhUSNj1fg CMU Great on the phone made sure to repeat my order to ensure they got it right Reasonable delivery 20 mins or so We ordered the boneless sparerib combo the sesame chicken combo Both were good especially since they weren t dripping in too much sauce 
O6mFk1w-hd5HkxBlnfAciQ CMU This place sucks I ve never had a worse meal in New York than here Possibly ever Absolutely terrible Service was surly and unhelpful Here s what we ordered Chicken Lo Mein Flavorless the noodles were way too soft very little meat in fact very little of everything except a bit of cabbage and noodles How do you screw this up Singapore Mai Fun The recipe for this is something like Boil a ton of rubberbands mix with all varieties of reject meat dump in one cubic shitload of bad curry serve with garnish Both the menu and waitress promised this would be spicy and even with all that curry it wasn t even lukewarm I left at least 3 4 of the serving there gigantic portion at least and didn t even get it wrapped up because it was so terrible Egg roll We ordered a pork egg roll we were served a shrimp one we think This was actually inedible Like disgusting Like port o potty disgusting On top of all of this it was pricier than an actual Chinese place Don t be fooled by all the silly Columbia undergrads filling the place up Don t ever go here ever 
o9vNPUKGWSMc8JpgbDV_Mw CMU The food itself was decent The service was horrendous The server Amy wouldn t look at us in the face when we were trying to speak to her She also seemed to be frustrated with our questions about the menu Once the food arrived she never asked us if we were doing OK or needed anything else And the worst part was when she cleared our table she spilled plum sauce all over my pants purse and the purse of the patron at the next table Amy either didn t notice or didn t care because she kept on walking I ll probably only go back there if I m desperate for decent Chinese food near my apartment otherwise I ll take a trip down to Chinatown were the food is excellent and cheaper 
OaMia2idwF-pJBFwD4m5AQ CMU really bad and oily All the food there seems sharing the same sauce and seasoning and the waiters and waitress always bring you the check right after you finish your dish or sometimes before you finish 
obqzffOq2CUJnFfcXqKeog CMU Good portions Oily bland inconsistent food Offensively bad service 
OpIbgx_jVCgzJ6crtqF1vg CMU I take advantage of the lunch special because it s enough food to last me two semi decent meals during cram days I ve been currently stuck on the chicken with eggplant Its not exactly authentic chinese shanghainese food and my parents would be ashamed if they actually knew how many times I ve ordered from them but it s a notch above the regular MSG laden mush you get at most Chinese fast food joints For the price it s perfectly decent Also don t order the drunken chicken or wine chicken It s a childhood favorite of mine and they almost ruined it Almost I hear it s kind of a tough dish to make so I shouldve known better but just a heads up 
OVaJU8lRtGq2AKWzxS0O7g CMU We rated Wai Lee a 2 5 rounded to a 3 They have crab rangoons which is a big plus for us The other plus was the price It possibly the cheapest meal we ve had in NYC Wai Lee is the epitome of American Chinese While waiting for our food they must have served 10 orders of Fried Chicken and P F D pork fried rice The entrees weren t very good at all 
o_fd6B8l0-MjQPYjXs9j2g CMU The service here wasn t bad nor was it good It was just meh The food was the same way Seemed like a waste of for what I got which was General Tso s chicken and rice but ahh you live and you learn 
p1bTw-BtK_vLKhmnsg_AhQ CMU For a Chinese fast food delivery restaurant this place has surprisingly good chicken wings Expect everything to be oily and deep fried but that s what they do best Delivery is slow however and they refuse to deliver past a 10 block radius If you order in store be sure to speak loudly or else they won t hear you behind their cage 
pBCuT-SXtzEJrWrfTbwINg CMU Ollie s has been feeding college students and lovers of cheap NY style Chinese food for many many years I was personally hooked on the shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce with brown rice for years it was just so darn convenient quick and cheap And tasty if you re a fan of the typical chinese food that one expects to find in New York I could probably go on and recount the joys of cheap NY chinese in a Seinfeld like rave but suffice it to say you can get almost every imaginable stir fry noodle dish soup or fried rice variation under the sun at any one of the many locations across Manhattan I particularly liked the lunch combo special of a soup and entree for under 7 that comes out in a hot steamy jiffy and leaves you full and happy At least after you ve had lots of jasmine tea to wash it all down and alleviate any grease guilt that you may be be enduring Good value all around and they tend to be open late if you want something light like some dumplings after you get out of an evening movie at the big movie theatre across the street 
pdemfRde4d51u1Pcctbmog CMU My kind of fried rice Also the broccoli with garlic sauce is very good if a little salty and the dumplings aren t bad either Service is quick and you can t beat the price 
PEdrffcfRmQpLCB23UI35A CMU This was OK for New York I guess but compared to what I am used to in Japan these were mediocre at best and overpriced I share the thoughts of another reviewer who said that the dumpling wrappers were much too thick Still the service was excellent and the staff very helpful 
pjICsBnmIPZFpdw5KtSSJA CMU Meh I ve experienced better 8 vegetable dumplings and a can of soda for almost 9 is a lot of money for mediocre dumplings and a fanta The dumplings were not bad but not awesome The sauce doctored soy with a strong earthy aroma and not very spicy I might go back to fill a dumpling craving mmm dumplings but not until I ve tried all the other Chinese restaurants in the area I was so excited to try them after I read the reviews Sad face 
PlefQpmwtsU1R9ARxB6QCw CMU First off the prices for this place are great Nothing is very expensive I had the shredded chicken Cantonese noodle soup It was OK it was a huge portion I think a table of four could have eaten from it The problem was that it had no flavor It was as it said chicken and bean sprouts in broth Nothing more nothing less Matt had the Cantonese style roast pork He didn t really like it to much he said it tasted like they used way to much vinegar I didn t think it was bad at all It came with a side of rice but there was no soy sauce in sight or waiter to ask I actually like his better than I liked mine We had two large Saporas and it came out less than 30 The only problem was that the service was really bad We went in around 3 30 or so and the place had two other customers and it took them 15 minutes to come over and take our order They never once came over to see if we needed anything but as soon as we finished though they did rush over to give us our check They need better customer service 
plN5hhaj9aCoW7FOAHm5uw CMU I was told this is the best Chinese food place around Columbia and I totally agree The steamed port feet with spinach the combo soup and the saute salted pork slice were awesome they really nailed both Sichuan and Shanghai food at the same time impressive P S ask for free wine if you happen to dine at dinner time they won t tell you unless you ask for it 
pnlmVaZRjdoulq2kP20Q5g CMU It has way more Chinese people at any given time than Ollies that should say something Not that it s the most authentic Chinese food around but the comparative cosy atmosphere free wine and big round tables in the back make it a fun place for large group dinners 
pU119mplgEacrjdo0tgbMg CMU Yay So happy East Dumpling House is in the neighborhood For starters instead of water they serve a very light iced tea green I think Water is also available of course They also gave a complimentary small dish of really good fried chicken The dumplings are delicious the fillings are fresh and have no gnarly bits the wrapping is good and light and the spicy sauce is great The pork chive dumplings were amazing and the pancakes of both the both potato and scallion variety were hot and savory and tasty Can t wait to go back and try oh everything else The best part Dinner for two was twenty and change 
Pz3ZkicVS9GMgHfPR59VZA CMU Ollie s is excellent bad Chinese food While I m sure that the food here is offensive to even the most amateur diners of authentic Chinese cuisine it s pretty darn delicious to us philistines who also enjoy Panda Express And while Ollie s serves one of the best bad Chinese food in the city its appalling standards of service and its exorbitant prices despite being a bad Chinese food joint make me a less than an enthusiastic customer While I m one to believe that a restaurant cannot be judged from one dish alone I think Ollie s best dish the General Tso s chicken is a great reflection of the restaurant as a whole First and foremost is that neither Genreal Tso nor Ollie s is real Chinese food Secondly neither General Tso s chicken nor Ollie s is very healthy But authenticity and health issues aside the General Tso s is delicious because it s crispy so much so that you forget you re eating mystery chicken meat and overly sauced which also helps conceal the quality of meat In short Ollie s is not a place for the discriminating palate And the theme of low quality maked by heavy sauces and seasoning repeats itself in most of the dishes And though I m addicted to the excellent bad General Ts s here the other dishes aren t too bad either The lo mein and the fried rice there are a bit too greasy for my liking but the little bit of everything soup is a pretty good on a rainy cold day If you re looking for a casual meal that s saucy filling and uncomplicated Ollie s isn t the worst choice you can make in the neighborhood I am happy to eat at Ollie s because as I made it clear I enjoy bad Chinese food But one of the hallmarks of bad Chinese food is that it s suppose to be cheap Ollie s is getting more and more expensive each year that a dish of General Tso s is now 10 50 for dinner and 8 50 for lunch For those prices I could get a much better in terms of quality and tastes meal in this neighborhood Lastly the service is wretched Granted that this place is a bad Chinese restaurant an expected stronghold of surly servers but Ollie s seems to take crabby service to a new level The cast members of this awful team include the girl on the telephone order who yells at you because you took up 2 extra second to glance at the menu the delivery man who spits on you and never apologized for it the other delivery man who swears in Chinese in front of you and your friend because he feels he didn t get tipped enough the waitress that barks white rice or brown rice and the waiter that demands to know why you left a tip smaller than 15 Just how bad is the service Last year there were allegations that Ollie s was being cruel to its workers making them work illegally long hours for absurdly low wages Now when I heard that my first thought wans t that s awful I can t believe my neighborhood Chinese place would practice such unscrupulous tactics Nope the first thing that went through my head was Oh Ollie s workers are overworked and underpaid That explains everything now 
pZkr6Otg_sWGJyN-K4yp9A CMU pretty good quality tasty too try it out these guys are taiwanese 
Q2pnPYuYDE9Hx0QO0RNC2A CMU I loved the duck noodle soup or whatever it was called for a while But eventually I got a little grossed out by having to fish through the gross parts to get to the meat That might be authentic ish but I m from upstate New York The love fizzled Everything else ranges from eh to not that good It s cheap enough though 
q31sQUfNbL7b9s4MZMLMtA CMU The place looks like a dump and the food is more or less reflective of this appearance I even did the safe thing and didn t order any meat from here I got fried veggie dumplings They were kind of soggy and had a strange aftertaste and the dipping sauce that came with it was not the usual tart vinegary liquid with scallions but rather a very bland soy sauce All in all a disappointment The only reason I came here was because Panda Garden a few storefronts away was closed at the time 
q3xtC5rK8b8Yira5wIgs9w CMU I m a vegetarian and they delivered the wrong order the dumplings were all chicken and shrimp I called them to ask for a replacement which they grudgingly agreed to When it arrived though it came with a new bill that I refused to pay and had to send the delivery guy away Really unfortunate customer service Order at your own risk 
Q4uO-cYBk8SSvJWdRSiepw CMU My old school Chinese parents love this place It s true When they come over we talk about where to go out and eat Yes this is one Chinese restaurant here among maybe four but when they came they just had a blast Almost like they d want to come back It s definitely pricy enough but two things to make it worth the trip 1 Free house wine white It s probably bought boxed from Costco and slightly watered down but it s not bad 2 The Shanghai menu is more authentic and better Hands down best Chinese in Morningside I know that s not saying much at all 
q7tEkISRcRtp9sx-5F0V1w CMU My roommates and I have been struggling to find a good Chinese place in the area Naturally as we all tried different joints we developed separate preferences and turf wars started and so on and so forth so one day for lunch we decided to all order from China Place Since we got our food delivered I can t speak to the quality of the actual restaurant experience but our food came very quickly and they didn t charge us a delivery fee delivery is free for orders between 100th 145th Sts It s a little more expensive than places in the area really a little about 1 2 more for a lunch special but the product is very good I had a nice crispy General Tso s Chicken with some very good fried rice hard to find in Harlem and standard wonton soup Reheats well and they give you noodles and fortune cookies which you also don t really find in Harlem why which is about as much you can ask for 
QECkTIz1R5KuAiK2kUc2bw CMU Undergrad is long gone and meals of Snicker s bars and Combo s are a thing of the past Don t look at me that way You know you ate similar meals when you were a dopey freshman Anyways I ve been wanting to try out Ollie s only because it always looked pretty busy and busy is good right Well yes and no The food is pretty standard stuff I had the Chicken Bun and some Chicken Dumplings and my friend ordered the Broccoli in Garlic Sauce I liked my Chicken Bun a lot it was hot and steamy and the dough was light and fluffy and the filling although not plentiful it was pretty tasty The dumpling on the other hand were way too doughy not something I would order again The space is clean the service prompt and the appetizer menu prices are reasonable for the area Not Flushing by a long shot but reasonable I am getting another Chicken Bun this week 
qLlfpBsuZGp5nYBZzCiisA CMU Shrimp with Broccoli was mediocre at best 
QmBsBozDDSr0GszXEA3tUA CMU So the competition continues On rec from friends who used to rock the Manhattanville scene but now live in Ft Greene I tried this place and promptly moved it to vying for front runner status in the Best Chinese in West Harlem Challenge It s A Otay Not superb but definitely edible Mad Decent as it were Edged out China Place in competition Must fend off Hunan Balcony 
QMGvzFu3UDk9p2OWsMnHmA CMU Just because I m a chef doesnt mean i know anything but as an asshole i was mortified the 2 different times I was in this place I used to go to the one across from my job on 84th and they were pretty rude but the food was consistant And working at another place in timesquare i personally used to cook for uncle tom the owner and founder of Ollie s If he knew what was going on he would close this one as fast as he closed 84th I ve never been givin an attitude by a server for asking for another beer on top of that having my food basically thrown on the table Dude seriously I m a chef and if the customer asks me for something as i m checking out the dining room i get that shit CUSTOMERS COME FIRST without them you have no money To top it off I still gave the dick 18 and he stops me as I m leaving to question me AAaaa something wrong u know we pool tips here I replied explain to your co workers that your a cock and thats why ur average is low 
qNKqRchSpd_xHEl8bly_Pg CMU I heart West Place and my secrect experienced guideline for ordering their food is as follows Recommendation 1 Wonton Mix Egg Drop Soup sm 1 50 The best Wonton Mix Egg Drop in Chinese fast food restaurants Please remember to ask for the free fried beancurd sticks served with the soup 2 Szechuan Style Scrambled Eggs 5 Yes This dish is created by me because this restaurant takes customer s special orders I has order it for many times and it never disappointed me Good 1 Lake Tung Ting Shrimp jumbo shrimp marinated with broccoli mushroom bamboo shoots in egg white sauce 9 25 I was extremly full after finishing it myself 2 Shrimp Toast 4 2 75 3 Lunch Special 5 a great deal of rich content Bad 1 Egg Foo Young Too gravy 2 Fried Rice I didn t ask for white rice and they did it with yellow rice which turned out to be too dry Mon Sat 11am 11pm Sun 12pm 11pm Features Delivery Please enjoy my pic of it too _ 
qoUpYR5yJ2ROBeke90qiog CMU Decent chicken lo mein and f ing fantastic scallion pancakes I ll call that a win Good enough for who it s for In this case that d be moi 
qr-KZZS4uPmSQntAWR3Zyw CMU Dumplings are my favorite food and I ve been to most of the places that specialize in them in NYC so when I heard that the UWS was getting our own dedicated dumpling haunt I was pretty excited I ve put off writing this review for some time but after having had East Dumpling about every week for the past two months despite some initial disappointment I am happy to say that this has become my go to dumpling delivery joint In terms of value it s tough to find something that comes close 12 dumplings for 6 95 and about 8 are a full meal So for about 5 you can get your noodle wrapped meat fix without having to do any cooking Most Chinese places in the area and in general overcharge for their dumplings many charge about the same price for half as much and the ones that don t deliver the hot dog equivalent of a dumpling unseasoned ground meat parts with soy sauce While East Dumpling is definitely not the best dumpling I ve ever had it s above average and probably the best combination of price quality in the area The chicken green pepper dumpling is unique and livens up the otherwise standard fare but well executed dumpling options They use a fair amount of ginger in their filling which I don t think I ve had much but it makes them sometimes feel a bit one note in terms of flavor with the exception of the chicken and green paper dumplings they sort of all taste the same Overall a fine if unspectacular addition to delivery routine 
Qs94i_KNIEr7lkfTZrZjmg CMU Seriously is there something wrong with me I went back Crusted food on my teacup chicken is fatty and rubbery like it s just been reheated for the 10th time today waitresses act annoyed and mean Is there some malfunction in my brain that causes me to return to this place for a third time now 
QSnuUFrWX7OCbHGVJg2qaw CMU Good delivery in Harlem should be a category all to its own on Yelp we Harlemites need to band together and share the knowledge Ollie s has a wide delivery area rejoice I decided on three somewhat dirty Chinese food stars to start off this review It s good And their scallion pancake almost had me giving them four Though even sigh unseen I doubt I d want to relax and eat a meal here I have gotten delivered and very much enjoyed the shrimp with cashew nuts lots of nuts and the lunch special with soup is only 6 95 steamed veggie bun mmm bun aforementioned scallion pancake crispy and with great dippin sauce which we all know is k e y When ordering lunch breakfast after a long night I ask for a fried egg on top and call it breakfast grilled shrimp salad Iceberg yes but fresh and with great sesame soy vinaigrette spring rolls what I love crispy things moo shu vegetables snow peas and you know a couple diet cokes Also fyi the first time we ordered Dana was disappointed that they did not have the shumai that she usually gets and loves from the downtown Ollie s ah well I m over it I like em 
QWwqUGluKh1jm9AYGz3IVg CMU So surprised that this location is receiving such low reviews I know they are overpriced and often very busy but the food is pretty good Much better than anything else you can get by way of Chinese food in the area 
R1mEeHdyuby7whzDjrG-zw CMU To sum it up Wai Lee offers quick cheap and very tasty guilty pleasure food I heard about this place from someone who consistently ate here when they went to Columbia I was first unhappy with the food when I ordered Orange chicken doesn t taste like chicken but gave it another shot when other chinese places were either too pricey or didn t make the cut What sold me was the Chef s Special General Tso Chicken 9 SO GOOD It s enormous and I love it It makes about 2 days worth of left overs by itself The beef with broccoli is also really good and very fresh If you order more than 10 they give you a free soda egg roll or wonton soup which just sweetens the deal 
r2Nk9tuqhZzEiV_siC2Sag CMU Columbia is an Ivy League school supposedly full of America s most brilliant Then why is Ollies which serves the worst tasting least healthy food of most questionable origin thriving here This has led to much disillusionment I was dragged here a few times but the straw that broke the camel s back was when I made the mistake of ordering my beef without the high fructose corn syrup and vegetable oil sauce it usually comes with The result was a mound of something dry and grey that could have been beef but also could have been thousand year old llama poo 
r8C-ZAAK2XL5c7wW8HsXsw CMU Ollie s is everything that sucks about Columbia and Morningside Heights summarized in restaurant form It is dirty overpriced disturbingly short on quality inconvenient full of oblivious customers terrible awful rude service and can I say dirty one more time So profoundly terrible and such a waste of what should be a prime restaurant location that I honestly think all the people who gave it two stars are succumbing to the pressures of star inflation 2 stars would mean that Ollie s is a Meh I ve experienced better The bland subpar greasy overpriced food with terrible service Ollie s offers deserves 1 star at best 
rBO7uTafOfP55LP8SKwABg CMU Went for lunch on a Sunday and the food was pretty good Yes it might be a bit oily but still good quality food Service was decent though 
rCUboj-6iyegP61nmuif-A CMU does the job of a cheap corner decent Chinese take out place for those that want to stray from the chic broc combo they also have southern tastes on the menu a la fried chicken fries and more fried items they re also very cordial and fast you get what you pay for here so manage your expectations and satisfy your shameful cravings here 
rIkisfAPMzPO70MrtT48NA CMU This fantastic little place just opened between Broadway and Amsterdam right across from the Duane Reade I have been eagerly anticipating its food since they put up a paper sign that read dumplings in June I was not disappointed If you are Chinese or have ever been to the People s Republic you know that their dumplings are something that is imitated at every corner Red House or Palace Garden restaurant in the city However EAST takes the blue ribbon 7 00 for 14 perfect Pork and Chive dumplings made by hand in their huge back kitchen is a combo that can t be beat Their chicken won ton water dumplings come in a broth that you can tell by taste was made with tender care and real chicken not just salt 6 50 for 8 The veggie dumplings are fresh as can be and come in a thicker wrap to balance the softer taste of greens about 5 50 for 10 I have only eaten these three items but I can t wait to make this my main Dumpling hangout in the city Their menu s are in English Mandarin Korean and Japanese so don t be afraid to try conversing in which ever language you find most comfortable The staff is friendly fast and seems totally committed to the idea of the dumpling as an art form The red oil is right on par with the spiciness and excellent flavour that can be found in Sichuan Jia you Zhungguo Jia you EAST dumpling house 
-GtSjvKOAQ70HEY1-Ychiw CMU P F always holds a special place in my heart this was my first classy Asian restaurant At one point in my life I didn t know that Chinese food stretched further then my neighborhood china buffet And then 2 good friends brought me here You could only imagine how I felt when I saw those horse statues out front of the building I give this place 3 stars because I have since indulged in much better establishments particularly ones that are not chains However the food here is generally good Everything has a fresh taste and is presented nicely The service is usually good and the waitstaff puts on a nice little show for you if you tell them that Its your first time PF virgins well get a kick out of what they have to say They also have a pleasing drink list The plum wine PFX and the Plum Collins are a few must trys They even have a long list of Sake if your into that I always get a kick out of dessert so much yummie goodness I usaully have a hard time deciding what little Mini Dessert I m going to choose Come here and enjoy the food and the environment the decor is beautiful 
-jHC9vDC1XOK3s94BqmRHQ CMU Yummy I come here with my family all the time every time we visit sometimes for lunch but most of the time for dinner We usually order a bunch of dishes just because there s usually about 10 of us But all the food we order is good I especially like their Nian Gao I can never find any other place that makes it this way in LA The decor is ok It might need a little updating but it s not so bad Enough space for small and large groups I want to eat here again 
-KJP9tcUEWbm2mQnWvhGSQ CMU Only white people who don t know anything about real Chinese food would go to this restaurant and call it good 
-KZIDiL6gd7TLMPY3j-Kog CMU Authentic and tasty Chinese food Their Shanghai soup dumplings xiao long bao are AMAZING with a thin skin and lots of soup The skin is just thick enough that it won t puncture when you re picking it up but not too thick that it ruins the skin to meat ratio I have eaten plenty of XLB in my lifetime from China to LA and I d say that these rank pretty highly in my book We also got Loofah with gluten Pretty good but some of the loofah si gua didn t seem fresh It had an interesting side taste that I can t exactly pinpoint but it was sill good nonetheless Recommended Bean Curd Skins with mustard greens and soy beans Xue Cai Mao I thought it was fine but my mother wasn t a huge fan The bean curd skins were the kind that you could buy at a Chinese supermarket The dishes were kind of oily but nothing overwhelming and somewhat expected at a Chinese restaurant The service was fine and the decor was actually quite nice perhaps I m just used to hole in the wall Chinese restaurants Unfortunately a bit pricey but from what I ve been gathering that s expected here Pleasant first meal in the Princeton area and I ll probably be back to try the nian gao and chicken with water chestnuts So to sum up in four words GET THE SOUP DUMPLINGS 
-u9Kel3UPMaMVOZzEoi3fg CMU 4 stars because of what the yelp literally says Yay I m a fan It is almost surprising that a city like Princeton small but with a lot of rich people suburbians and a UNIVERSITY seriously doesn t even have a handful of dining options I guess that made the PF Chang an instant success when it first opened a little more than 5 years ago When I first got there from Los Angeles where PF Chang is just a good option I couldn t understand why I had to wait for more than an hour and a half for a table here I rarely reviewed on a franchise and will never do much but wanna write a good review about my experiences here because of the scarcity of dining options at Princeton I think the ambience is great for that price service is usually fine but could be a hit or miss During the numerous visits lunch dinner take outs late nights you name it my favorites were the chicken lettuce wrap mongolian beef dali chicken which I believe is off the menu now orange peeled beef chicken honey crispy chicken shrimp and the last but not the least the chicken noodle soup Ever since my wife bought it for me long time ago I am in love with it I guess my review could well apply for other branches in the US Still in Princeton this sure is a solid option for nice dinner 
0-TcQPqWNkXpy4CGfGEhlQ CMU I am surprised that this place has gotten such negative reviews I haven t been disappointed the last 2 times I have been here I remember that the Beef house noodles were really good The sesame chicken had a funny taste to it like it wasn t fresh or something was in the batter But like what everyone else said I think you will have a great time if you stick with the noodle dishes 
06RYyw_tZAYACYqpHkLqUA CMU I ve known this restaurant for years and according to regulars who have been there this restaurant has been around since 1997 Compared to Ivy Garden every Princeton resident who has lived in the area in the past decade knows that Tiger Noodles has stood the test of time while Ivy Garden has shifted ownership multiple times Currently as of this review Ivy Garden doesn t exist anymore and no new restaurants have moved into the place I have been all over the Princeton area for 10 years now and I can confidently say that Tiger Noodles is the best around I ve seen a variety of people come to eat here and whether you re a college student or just a resident looked for some grub this place is affordable beautiful outdoor seating weather permitting and good overall service Seems to be always busy and packed every time I step in Food is very good probably the closest you can get to the real thing in NYC Chinatown The owners of this place also own two more Ya Ya Noodles just off of Route 206 in the Montgomery Shopping Center and another Tiger Noodles in the Windsor Greens Shopping Center off of Route 1 and I ve been to those locations too and both off their own unique experiences too As for service I have never had an issue with the waiters or the managers they are always kind and remember me by name when I stop in I don t particularly understand why this awesome place gets so many negative reviews but I guess haters are gonna hate Must go if you are a newcomer to Princeton NOTE They do NOT take credit cards but there are ATM machines everywhere in downtown Princeton so that s not too bad 
0glZ2eP1d_Nl3cKOKhgyGA CMU I tried this place for the first time a couple of years ago while in town I am pretty sure I had ordered either cashew nut chicken or kung pao chicken and I remember it being good So being back in town again I ventured here with a friend for dinner We ordered the Seafood dumplings for starters These were pretty good I ordered iced tea to drink On the first sip it clearly tasted like there was some kind of soap in it I had to cancel that off my order and drink water I noticed on the menu they had Mango chicken Now back near home in Webster TX there is a restaurant called 888 Bistro that has really awesome chinese food The Mango chicken there is incredible and everything I ve tried not to mention the best crab puffs on Earth So assuming that Mango chicken may be somewhat similar here at Tiger Noodles and willing to experiment a bit I ordered it As another reviewer commented some things are apparently better than others The Mango Chicken blew goats Not even close to my beloved 888 My screaming plate of pathetic had skinny little slivers of chicken with about 10 billion hard french fry looking pieces of mango I could have built a fort with these things I ate a third grudgingly and had to stop Might be looking elsewhere for my Chinese fix next time in Princeton 
0hQENXaD2WYhvQsmLydQmA CMU Great place for Chinese food I ve been coming to this place for 3 years now and it never disappoints Very friendly and family owned Definitely a recommended spot one of my usuals 
0TGXQ2Zq2a_aiq6G78F2Zg CMU I ve only been here on the weekend for dimsum but haven t had a chance to order off the regular menu The dimsum experience was a bit disappointing as they lacked the traditional carts being pushed around The dimsum dishes were ordered off the menu making it somewhat of a surprise game when the actual dishes came The food overall tasted decent Flavor and authenticity wise I was not too disappointed The quantities and sizes however were a bit on the meager side especially with the sesame cakes being half the size of a golf ball The soy milk was a pleasant addition to the menu but they lacked the option sticky rice as a side The staff was generally friendly but we felt rushed and they gave us the impression that we were taking too long to decide Dimsum is a several hour event Other than that the quality of the food is not bad wish there was more variety and options on the menu I may be back to try the main menu but do not have high expectations 
0_tUsFe2EbsBp3_gdyobnw CMU 10 degrees outside and in need of some comfort Asian food I found Shanghai Park in the area of course on yelp While I had learned to eat soupy dumplings a k a pork buns on the English menu since despite my half Chinese background I can t read the Chinese one at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia CA I had extremely high expectations for Shanghai Park s For 5 95 you get an order of 6 dumplings we opted for 2 The sauce that comes with it is similar to that of soy sauce with vinegar and strips of ginger Our buns weren t that hot when it came out and even when you take a small bite of the steam no steam would arise before sipping out the soup slightly disappointing Also ordered their singapore style noodles also lukewarm and the taste was really nothing special I hear that they have dim sum here on weekends too and I ve been looking for a place to have that in close proximity so I m glad to hear that I ve been trekking to edison and nyc Expect an upcoming update review on their dim sum soon 
18fZxKLjG9bDaKpP9y2EUQ CMU Located a bit out of the way all the way down Witherspoon close to Princeton Medical Center is this tiny Chinese Malaysian restaurant that surprisingly serves up some of the best Chinese fare in downtown Princeton By best of course in the context of Princeton and its abhorrent lack of good Chinese restaurants I mean good If only Hunan was more centrally located on Nassau St I m sure this place would be buzzing To be honest I think the only reasons why Ivy Garden and Tiger Noodles still exist is because of its proximity to the Equad where the largely international engineering graduate students don t have meal plans and need to find places to eat every day I know this because every day the smell of bad Chinese food wafts through the building around lunchtime I digress Hunan s food is consistently good with few aberrations or atrocities All of the stir fried noodles both on the Chinese and Malaysian menu are pretty decent and I almost always order the eggplant and tofu in special sauce dish But warning Stay away from the pho Even if it s 20 degrees outside and all you want in life is a hot bowl of something True it s only 6 for a giant bowl but it was incredibly bland and slightly offensive in taste The mooshu pork was not my idea to order this was quite salty and the XO sauce that came with it was umm not XO sauce Whatever it was I didn t use it after my first wrap because it just accentuated the saltiness I ve taste tested most of the menu though and in general if you don t try to go for something wacky you ll be alright 
19w7dWpRR6b6rzZ3zOxjRg CMU The original store is based out of downtown Princeton This one is closer to the suburbs so they increased the price on everything The food is not too bad but you feel a little ripped off at the end 
1n2ZXT6DhGC6-G9ct1syew CMU I rarely find myself at P F Chang s mainly because I try to eat at more indie spots but every time I find myself dining at one I am always very happy and this location was no exception The wonton soup was stellar I could see heading in for just that and some Sapporo and calling it a day we also had lettuce wraps which were really good but they always are and mongolian beef I am not gonna lie I have had better Mongolian beef but all in all I was a big fan the service was prompt the beer was cold and the food was delish If I am ever in the neighborhood again I would stop back in for sure 
1qEm7NiqRjm3ok4Z7A2D-Q CMU are you guys all mental THIS PLACE SUCKS a few years ago my brother told me we should go eat there because it was really good and has a lot of food at least the second part of that was true my brother and i BOTH got diarrhea before we even left the joint uh oh it is way worse quality than any mcdonald s white castle wendy s etc everything is soooo greasy and the desserts make me want to vomit they had some cloudy white jell o cubes that looked suspicious they were also serving chicken feet i have to admit i tried them bad idea jeans yeah they have a great selection of horrible oily garbage maybe i should try the american food but like at that point why even go to a chinese buffet i agree with the person who said that it was hilarious but the food is definitely so so so bad 
1vbTKrWbl6jfbiVsuohNyQ CMU Omg i don t know if it was my selection of food that i chose but this was the worst chinese food I d ever had in my life My stomach aches at the thought of it I almost had to force it down 
1XNjbKts-Tzw2DmSHw9sIA CMU I ve had better It was edible but I wasn t really enjoying my food here 
2A9Y3J2UIQi7DlTNTcAgOA CMU Boring run down typical cheep chineese food service was slow at best We had to ask for more tea since after the food was delivered they never came back to the table Go elsewhere 
2H6BBD0ylFGXQRgkfs376A CMU The name of this restaurant kind of misled me to think of what I would imagine this place to be I thought this place was a noodle specialty place selling udon ramen wonton etc Instead this place is just a standard low end Chinese restaurant The place is not all that clean Waiters are rude and you feel rushed Food its meh All in all just a standard Chinese restaurant nothing special Don t waste your time here unless you are in the mood for cheap Chinese food FYI This place accepts cash only 
2hQ-NjsU15wJYP6s3KqzKQ CMU Let s get this out of the way I don t like chain restaurants generally I avoid them If there are more than 5 6 of a place I do not eat there Until on a trip to California someone took me to a PF Chang s for dinner Wow Best chain place EVER I loved the food Then I tried the one closest to my home in Princeton home run Outta the park I ve eaten at a couple more all consistent and excellent I m a fan this is a great place to dine Highly recommended 
2Htn4OeujGpgtZ5dX3G03A CMU I have a hard time rating Chinese restaurants because I so rarely find them to be distinctive from one another I was pleasantly surprised walking into Shanghai Park as small door gives little indication of the spacious well lit interior I had heard they have good bubble tea here so I ordered a Black Tea w milk right away I was not disappointed The tea was sweet not watery and the bubbles big and squishy The meal itself was unremarkable as a majority of American Asian cuisine tends to be It was satisfactory for a casual dinner amongst friends but I wouldn t take my grandparents here on their anniversary Although I will be back for more Bubble Tea 
2m37yfmWydxacRPfxad7FQ CMU Let me start off by saying that I ve been to PF Changs in general probably 8 9 times in the past After last night s experience though I think I m done This place is too trendy pricey and overrall full of itself to get my money any longer I went with family last night and it was for the first time empty I can only hope people finally realized it is not as good as the hype and the trend is dying down Having had good experience with their fish entrees I ordered the Ginger Salmon Considering it s name I thought it would have a ginger flavor Nope it didn t The waitress took it back and upon the manager s recommendations they put in an order for the Grilled Salmon asparagus something Now why they couldn t just redo the Ginger Salmon I don t know The manager brought the new one out of course everyone at my table was already done eating apologized and told me I will love this new dish and it is full of flavor Umm nope This one was the exact same as the last one except they grilled the crap out of it Ugh What is going on with this place Usually everything is salty but at least that is some kind of a flavor They took it off the bill which was nice it was an 18 50 entree with no flavor but come on I don t recommend this place considering it s not authentic everything is crazy overpriced the staff is slow and drinks are ridiculously priced too and apparently their cooking staff and management are idiots My bf loves this place but after this he can go there alone Oh and I agree with another poster Instead go to Sunny Garden which is a short walk away behind the Pep Boys That is a great place for authentic Asian fare Screw PF Wangs 
2XmhoZ7SMs2SN9o43tlKWA CMU The sushi is amazing I came to this little unassuming restaurant with my grandmother who had been there twice before for the sushi She walks in says We want sashimi to the host who seats us then has the sushi chef come over to talk to us He asked us what kind of fish we liked if we liked it sweet or spicy or sour then recommended some wonderful dishes The Seafood Parfait was delightful and the Hot Lover roll is to die for The fish on our sashimi platter was so fresh and tender it was fantastic And on top of that he made us this adorable sushi dessert that was really interesting and tasty This restaurant might be in a strip mall but their sushi chef makes this place one of my top picks for sushi 
2YXcOBQlssDFbP2KysyHhQ CMU another east coast chinese restaurant you know shiny food with same old taste i went there with a friend who s visiting her cousin in princeton we got general tso s chicken and chicken in garlic sauce both dishes were nice general tso s chicken was crispy and tasty and the chicken in garlic sauce was tender they didn t blow my mind though the portion was much larger than tiger noodles AND more importantly they didn t use as much MSG as tiger noodles so on your way to tiger noodles you should stop a block early and eat here instead the food is cheaper and better and contains less msg and the eating area is more spacious 
34afeaWJtcFN5ARTaF4k-g CMU I really am not a fan of Americanized Chinese Food because sauces tend to be gloppy and heavy I generally choose Thai Japanese or Korean over any Chinese restaurant Shaghai has proven to be an exception to the rule Not everything is fantastic here but most things are very good The service is pretty terrible but I ve never had a bad meal so I m willing to forgive that Contrary to a few of the other reviews I ve found the food here to be as good as most of the restaurants in NY s Chinatown 
3aZUFzBcaGdzedyl1JOmCw CMU May not be truly authentic Chinese but it sure is yummy This is an excellent place to take your family or your partner s family on a special occasion I ve heard fantastic things about the lunch buffet and the sushi but sadly haven t been able to try either yet All of the food I ve had here has been excellent and the prices very reasonable for value recieved You re going to pay more than you would at your typical take out place but then again the food is much much better and so is the atmosphere 
3cWFO5tsTYHKwIsLBF_jdA CMU One word to describe this place consistent They have CONSISTENTLY managed to mistaken me as a Chinese person the past 3 years I have gone there So maybe in their disappointment service has CONSISTENTLY been horrid They have been short with me every time I go Very rude So I be short with them too 1 order of Soup Dumpling at 6 95 CHEAP 1 order of soup spicy cabbage or shredded pork with hot peppers are the default ones Eat and bounce But to linger on the food It s okay I have had better I have had bigger and tastier soup dumplings but this place is certainly more CONSISTENT in what you expect For that I give it 3 total stars for this place 
3PXBfwiqOYtqGx3rD-LvCA CMU Recent glaring inconsistencies in the information provided by employees regarding available vegan options at P F Chang s has caused me to question their commitment to abiding by dietary restrictions I urge all diners to check with their server manager and even corporate before consuming anything questionable 
3Ue5ll4X-l82KN7iZexOEQ CMU I love eating here so much The food is really authentic and the price point is awesome The dimsum is delicious Since I m chinese I know that this place is super authentic Also service there is really nice as well It is a place I go with my friends all the time The food is just so amazing Last time my friend and I got MUSHU meat in a wrap Trust me It is to die for Best chinese food around here Go give it a try you won t regret it 
3zKTitn3MbY5h86Y_spHKA CMU Just went to PF Changs again last night and I have to say the food was tasty This place is crazy busy all the time and thank goodness that there always seems to be room at the bar My favorite item on their menu is the chicken lettuce wraps and the staff is always very attentive and friendly 
43TjzxqXsinOJryWwTC86Q CMU Good dishes Crab Rangoon crab cheese mix is pretty tasty Double Sauteed Pork spicy pork very tender Also has mushroom green pepper cabbage Beef with Snow Peas and Mushroom beef is tender flavor is nice with the snow peas and mushroom Shredded Pork with Bean Curd my favorite dish and very cheap for lunch special It s dry bean curd dofu gan in chinese with pork Also has green peppers onions and scallions Amazing flavor Beef Stew Noodle Soup spicy Beef nice and tender Soup broth is delicious General Tso Sesame Chicken both comes with 3 pieces of brocolli Great for pairing up with another dish that has veggies I d stay away from Mapo Tofu way too much MSG Hunan Beef weird flavor and Chinese Curry Chicken nothing like Japanese or Indian curry Just weird in general I wouldn t say Ivy Garden or Tiger Noodles is strictly better than the other Both have their specialities and you need to figure out what s good for each 
47MWenlwxu6mfaOXUH5ZBQ CMU The best Chinese in the area hands down Sesame chicken spinach fried wontons bliss My only complaint is that they don t deliver to Hoboken 
47oT1UFIgZaGoEr6zz3PYw CMU I ve been eating at PF Chang s all over the country for last 15 years including the Princeton establishment since it opened a few years ago I was there this week and shocked to see their portions which seemed to have reduced to less than half of its original dinner portions The portions were significantly smaller for everyone in our group They had also skimped on the sauces and the plates almost looked empty Incidentally the prices remain around the same or gone up a bit I understand restaurants have to cope up with rising prices but food service business is competitive and there are many other fine Asian restaurants in the area including Elements of Asia which still serves excellent food at 10 15 lower prices and without skimping out on the portions 
4fTVAKcvWKVF1eiJiA5OEA CMU I have to concer with Angela Z s review It looks like your typical Chinese take out with the same furniture paper menus and set up that about a million other places have These places must be sold as a start your own restaurant kit One thing I did notice the first time walking in however was how clean the place was I ve been to about a million take out places where they usually don t care about the dining area since most of there customers are carry out or delivery You can tell however that this place seemed to care a bit more The food on the other hand is excellent I tried the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce The shrimps were nice and large tasted fresh and were not overcooked The sauce had the right consistency not watered down and the rice was excellent The egg drop soup and fried won tons were excellent as well The portions are large and the prices are great The combo platters are especially a great deal This is probably not the place to go if you want to impress a date but if you are hungry and are looking for good food this place is it 
4iwsUE2MPFZbRf5vChLoBA CMU A friend of ours lives in Plainsboro so we decided to go here after a movie one night I see mixed reviews for this place based on the food and it s service Let me give you my opinion Food The food was slightly above average I went there with a Chinese girl who knows her authentic food and she said that it was pretty good and had some menu items that are usually not seen in other Chinese restaurants We would give it a solid 7 on the taste scale Service here is where they out shined other restaurants I don t know if it s because they re aware of the negative feedback on Yelp or they just have genuinely nice servers but our guy was very attentive and friendly during the course of our dinner He even recommended some of the dishes Kudos for that Bottom line When we re in the area again we ll go back 
4qpO2ddet8FCQFAKTA4Ciw CMU we have been to this location three times and the original in Princeton at least 5 the food is consistently good especially the scallion pancake as other reviews here mention the servers are pretty surly we figure they either don t speak much English or really don t care we have yet to have a bad experience despite 
4VOFACaFhqDF02kF5O3elQ CMU We stopped here for dinner tonight Stepped in were warmly greeted and brought to a comfortable booth Tea and water were brought out immediately The crispy duck sounded good 13 95 half with boneless spare ribs 6 and shrimp toasts 5 as appetizers with a request for chile oil The spare ribs were too sweet Not as sweet as from some places but too sweet for me to continue eating particularly without any rice to soften the taste A generous portion We had to ask again for the chile oil The shrimp toasts were fluffy Not the usual shrimp paste on baguette slices fried and likely invented by Cuisinart in the 50 s but with more of a fried dumpling like texture Coated in sesame seeds Served with that orangy maraschino flavoured duck sauce Without the sauce the best item we had for dinner The duck was disappointing Not crispy Actually fatty soft and overly salty atop some gross looking cabbage No mild dipping sauce of any sort No soy Not even mustard But the fattiness and super saltiness turned me off The fortunes were lame but the orange slices were good 31 including tax and tip Ivy Garden is so much better 
4xJaSICAgRQW5hi34tAXmw CMU have you ever seen the south park episode where stan s dad is trying to take the biggest crap in the history of the world and he achieves that by eating a lot of PF chang s i feel like that isn t far off every time i have eaten there i have felt uncomfortably full and had messed up bowel movements afterwards that might be a personal issue with self control though rather than with the actual restaurant the food here is pretty good but it s SOOOOOOO OILY and sooooo bad for you i almost don t consider it to be chinese food at all for real it s just as greasy as denny s i think it s cool that they give you all those sauces to alter the taste to your liking but it s such a drag to eat there it is LOUD constantly packed with the most obnoxious losery people and you almost always have to wait even if you have a reservation my man and i had reservations for valentine s day last year and we still had to wait an hour i was like wow i m really glad i made reservations they have good drinks there but they re expensive i guess they kind of are everywhere though i wouldn t really call this an expensive restaurant but you could definitely get better and cheaper chinese food at a local place if you have to go here make sure you get this dessert called THE GREAT WALL OF CHOCOLATE it s amazing but for real try not to go there at all it s not cool 
5-XoZGh8Vc7DysKhzf7lEg CMU I d rather eat Cup O Noodles than spend 8 here Granted Princeton s East Asian food scene is notoriously Americanized 1 but Tiger Noodles makes P F Chang s seem like a Chinatown joint My visits here have always been disappointing and bordering on humorously bad The soup noodles consist of resuscitated dried white flour noodles floating in an uninspired sepia toned MSG broth that is garnished with few bits of meat and veggies The tofu and eggplant dish features a syrupy orange sauce smothering chunks of tofu and sliced eggplant and served with rice This is par for the course here and gives you an idea of what the other entrees are like Unless you re in the mood for a caricature of Chinese food steer clear of Tiger Noodles and head to one of the places listed below to satisfy your cravings for East Asian cuisine On the other hand if you enjoy Americanized Chinese food you may be in for an affordable treat here Footnote 1 Princeton has a few gems of East Asian cuisine Ajihei serves excellent Japanese food see http www yelp com biz ajihei princeton Shanghai Park is not bad though it is a trek away from Princeton U see http www yelp com biz shanghai park princeton and Nassau Sushi serves fairly good Korean Japanese dishes see http www yelp com biz nassau sushi princeton 
55AgNcsjk3ncAI6xYx1BmQ CMU At first sight of PF Changs I had no desire to go in I figured I can get this food at Great Wall number 28 or Six Happiness However I noticed there was a 2 5 hour wait so I thought it must be good And OMG it was da bomb It tasted like Six Happiness on HGH The food is so much fresher and less greasy It doesn t leave that hurt and regret feeling I usually get after eating take out The waiter Jonathan was like Peyton Manning After we gave him our order he gave us an audible and completely changed our order for the better The food complimented itself and left me wanting more It also left me wanting to marry an Asian girl I wonder if that is just a coincidence 
5AOv9NapTlJr7mVN7rBBvg CMU I love this place for an extremely cheap lunch of 7 bucks for a soup and a big plate of singapore rice noodles with shrimp If you are in the mood for some chinese food this place is cheap and pretty good Just be aware they only accept cash 
5EGrtXs5JALb5pJ51Tg_4w CMU Under new management this restaurant seems to be serving similar recipes as its predecessor Overall the food is fairly simple and does not in my opinion compare favorably with nearby Shanghai Park or Hunan On an occasion when I asked for a recommendation from their chinese menu I was told forcefully that there would be nothing I would like Nevertheless the restaurant remains a good place to get a quick bite to eat at a fairly good price 
5Uap5TcbnarcYTei8bovFA CMU If 5 a star was an option I d pick it First problem was that the waitress could not understand us or the menu saying there was no shrimp when we saw it delivered to the next table Several of the dishes were cold and we waited until almost everyone had eaten b4 bringing bland soup Only words waitress seemed to know were where s my tip Maybe cause it s new but this was not a good experience 
5vXAyM1B6KcotcBiE92SxQ CMU After attend Montgomery Middle School on People to People s program to Australia demostration we came to this nice Ya Ya Noodle at Montgomery Center nearby off Rt 206 North for dinner We kind of know where it is because we came hear every time we visit the area We also visit their sister Tiger Noodle at Princeton when we were there Everytime we came here seem to be seated in different round table and this time we got one right in front of the Asian Chinese Character Board saying Eat First It is nice we seldom see those in the US and my father was Chinese Professor in Taiwan Culture University he write Chinese Caligraphy very well We order some nice small bum and fri dumbling as apertizer which taste very good after chewing some Chinese fried noodle with saurce The waiter and waitress are nice to give us two dishes as we looked very hungry after a whole afternoon of Open Houses in Warren area before heading down to Montgomery Then we had General Tso Chicken as kids always love Family Tou Fu that we always like to have then a Mongomery Beef which taste great and also checked out a Tai Chicken that we always order one new to try out each time We like the way it sever to get all dishes and rices on at the same time this is very different from Chinese Dim Sim we had in the morning at Jade Dynasty off Rt 22 before heading up to Open House at Warren which provides one or two at a time as ordered So the dinner is more like a traditional Chinese dinner that family can shared everything There are many other customers and the feeling was warm while it was raining very heavily outside They also kept providing hot tea and cold water which is nice that we do not need to tell them to refill The whole bill is quite affordable of about 67 for a family this is a bid less than the Hometown Buffet at Edison we went the evening before and about the same as the dinner we had at Norstorm Cafe at Short Hill Mall on Saturday but that required us to visit White Castle off Rt 22 later the night So Ya Ya is both tasteful and economic We like the candy on the way out it looks big and taste great very different from Northstorm Cafe s long stick chocalate mint and much better than most Chinese restaurants little candy The only thing they did not have is the orange that many Chinese restaurant would provide when bringing in the check instead they bring in the fortune cookie 
5ymTLa-Jm3FKxLgJjcLBCw CMU Shanghai Park is our standard restaurant to take friends and to have family gatherings The menu is expansive food is authentic and size decor are appropriately tasteful We always start with a variety of appetizers smoked fish drunk chicken braised beef and of course the xiao long bao soup dumplings Depending on the size of the group we ll then get some combination of main courses Favorites nian gao rice cakes beef noodle soup double sided pan fried seafood noodles fried flounder a whole flounder and jumbo fried shrimp with walnuts Service is mostly good with a couple of the waiters particularly professional and fast with taking orders and getting dishes to the table One star is deducted as the price is rather high for the quality Lunch can easily run over 20 per person Overall though Shanghai Park consistently sets a high bar and is one of the few in its class of better Chinese dining establishments in the Princeton area 
5zhoFsUTdYOOh0NJ0vEiYQ CMU A 45 minute wait on a Friday night well worth it The venue is a bit small considering that the outside looks like a palace The food was to die for I had the pepper steak with chicken lettuce wraps Perfect combo of spice and portions at a reasonable price I may never order Chinese takeout ever again having been spoiled by P F Chang s Can t wait to revisit 
5_7brOZfZjoLmLrlcdJqCQ CMU I am a little bit disappointed that there s not a lot of great Chinese restaurant in Princeton I mean geez We have an international crowd here and I think Chinese is what I would say the most common food that you can find anywhere I think most of the major cities in the world would always have some sort of Chinatown We used to go to Good Friends in West Windsor NJ which serves a decent meal We ve been to Sunny Garden PF Changs Shanghai Park and each of them would present an a OK Chinese meal Hunan as they claim serves Cantonese Szechuan and Hunan dishes I guess depending on who s cooking your Pan Fried Noodles could either be served with a brown sauce or the white lobster sauce the noodles are not actually the Hong Kong style Angel Hair noodles that s crisp to perfection but the Fried thick Noodles Not a big fan of that I think when you place your order you have to specify which type of sauce you want to avoid confusion The wings was good When we went there there was a father and a 3 yr old son waiting for the fried wings Father claimed that his son is gaga over that wings Again you have the typical American Favorite Chicken with Broccoli This restaurant is great for Take out especially if you don t have time to cook The Tofu was typical nothing really outstanding So if you need dinner don t want to cook and want some decent meal for the family Hunan is the place to order 
5_nLTXVQ4lNTV86CvVzvLQ CMU Best authentic Cantonese style cuisine in town 
67l40sH5kdKkZ-A45BG41Q CMU Really shocked about some of these negative reviews I only stick to two dishes here but find them to be very tasty My favorite being silver thai noodle 
68iB7dAnlAKs8gEqrZcTbg CMU They serve a very good hot and sour soup here which is the sole reason I m reviewing this place at all Not many restaurants make hot and sour soup the way they do Other items on the menu are just average and nothing special Their lunch special portions are good enough The quality of the food was better in the past I used to come here several times a month when I used to live in this area It s not authentic Chinese food but it s good enough for your commercialized beef with broccoli and shredded pork with garlic sauce 
68Jk4SymFKc3cb4QEJJ5tw CMU had lunch here and made the mistake of not doing take out If you sit down and eat the buffet its VERY overpriced for dried out or in some cases greasy slop The selection is decent but there has to be some concern regarding freshness of the food Everything looked like it was cooked a week ago and was just being reheated over and over again What I had seemed fresh enough though hence the two star rating but overall it was very overpriced PS Both the Jello and chocalate cake of some variety looked as if it had been part of a science experiment as both were crusty and pretty watery overall a wierd experience When the waitress sat down to talk to me about something incoherent was the icing on the cake for me NEVER AGAIN 
6B9vkHyjG4UR2lgEgZOIgQ CMU PLEASE BRING BACK THE WILD ALASKAN SOCKEYE SALMON SALAD Quite a few items have been pulled off their menu it s so upsetting I hope its only the Princeton branch that has a change of menu i really liked their salads and they only offer ONE salad now ONE and its the most boring one Oriental Chicken the Sriracha Shrimp and Nico s Favorite are gone too How sad I hope PF Chang realizes that they have to offer more than ONE salad on their menu This is America after all I ve liked everything I ve had at PF Chang The traditional chinese dishes are nothing to shout about though still good but I think the Lettuce Wrap is fun and i d also recommend the the double pan fried noodles i like the crispy noodles And I think their Zodiac Noodle was pretty good too but thats another item I don t see anymore Why Service is always friendly at PF Chang I bet the waiters must be so annoyed at having to recite their sauce mix introduction every time After hearing it so many times now I really wish they would stop PF Chang s definitely a really good chain restaurant I can t believe they haven t opened one in NY Its chinese food with a twist with better service and set in a bistro And at very reasonable prices Oh and i love love love their bathroom Very sturdy hardwood doors for their cubicles I always appreciate my privacy in the bathrooms 
6EddKh77glFV276QKIJ90A CMU This is the first time I ve been to a PF Changs The atmosphere was very cool almost like the cheesecake factory and the service was great I got the 4 course meal option which I believe is a decent deal with a soup appetizer entree and a dessert The chicken lettuce wraps were very good The chicken was salty but was well balanced with the cold fresh lettuce I also got the sesame chicken This is different than your takeout sesame chicken as it didn t seem battered and deep fried but seemed stir fried with no batter coating I was a bit disappointed because it was a bit bland The mongolian beef was very good The beef itself was well seasoned and very juicy It was very similar to Korean style bbq The only complaint is that the rest of the dish is scallions that were cut in large pieces This made the dish very spicy and it was difficult eating the large pieces of scallions I highly recommend the banana spring rolls for dessert Overall I think this is okay chinese food Maybe the other dishes such as noodles are better but I think there are better Chinese food in the area in Princeton 
6rioF7H7OiCcUWh4Pm0ARQ CMU Ya Ya Noodles is pretty good all things considered It s certainly better than the average Chinese fare I m not a huge fan of Americanize Chinese food because of the gloppy sauces that permeate the dishes Both Ya Ya and Shanghai Park manage to avoid these pit falls Of the two I would definitely give it to Shanghai Park particularly when it comes to juicy buns 
6woqbhcY3JHmdopAkaxkEQ CMU I would say the best Chinese restaurant near Princeton above Hunan Ivy Garden and Tiger Noodles Need to know which ones are good though Great dishes Fish Fillet with Schezwan Sauce great flavor and perfect amount of spicyness imo not super spicy but can taste the spiciness Fish fillet is cooked with chinese cabbage Mu Shu Beef Pork mushroom eggs meat cabbage cooked together tastes great Comes with 4 very thin tortillas though they call them pancakes and sauce similar to the one in peking duck I m not sure if it s hoisin sauce or tian mian jiang please let me know if you do Scallion Pancakes I like scallion pancakes in general and these ones were good General Tso s Chicken You Tiao they have these on the weekends Beware the dou jiang is weird they put zha cai in there and it has a really sour taste Decent dishes I wouldn t mind getting again Two Flavor Chicken the general tso s chicken portion is good the chicken w snow peas portion doesn t taste anything special and I found it boring Lion s Head w Vegetables shi zi tou 3 bigass meatballs with a nice sauce Has a bit of chinese greens in it I think it was bok choy xiao long bao I m not a fan of xiao long bao in general and will never get it again here but it s worth trying just once Duck Gizzard ya zhen it s not on their menu It s 7 for a box of like 20 of these It was too salty for my taste but I don t mind eating it again Bean Curd Schezwan Style Silken tofu sauce is slightly spicy similar to fish fillet w schezwan sauce but feels more oily Dishes I ll never get again Shanghai Noodle w pork spinach i don t know what shanghai noodles are supposed to taste like but theirs have a really thick and chewy texture to it Flavor is lacking and too much oil Stay away Shredded Beef with Hot Pepper Noodle Soup this is quite spicy but the flavor just didn t work for me Kung Pao chicken it wasn t horrible but not good enough for me to want to ever get again Chinese spinach forgot the full name but the spinach are really oily Stay away Shredded Beef w Celery beef is not tender enough flavor nothing special a disappointing dish overall Beef w brocolli beef is not tender brocolli pieces are huge flavor is boring Chicken w Eggplant wow the flavor is extremely lacking in this one Each eggplant has completely no flavor Chicken slices are nothing special 
70TytPcYzkAfZlsGiX4pQA CMU Tiger Noodle offers good Chinese food in a casual setting and is hands down the best Chinese joint in Princeton I usually order something with vegetables tofu and or noodles but my friends have ordered just about everything on the menu My favorites are the steamed vegetable dumplings the mu shu vegetable and the Thai Silver Noodles The restaurant itself is small so often there s a short wait The wait staff is very friendly and the prices are fair 
783GyvU5QVB6NEzbDN_EEw CMU Wear your elastic pants and buckle up kiddies Santa s taking you on a gluttonous sleigh ride I emerged at least 2 sizes bigger after my rambunctious extended family hit Super Star on Christmas for the special menu buffet w additional seafood dishes The food both fake Chinese and authentic items is fresh and tasty and is of higher quality than the Christmas menu at CJ Garden Buffet East Windsor NJ Although the sushi isn t particularly exciting and tends to be more of the spicy tuna and futomaki variety than raw fish the fried dishes were especially good not soggy at all I also liked the walnut mayo shrimp too it s as good as I ve had it in proper Chinese restaurants With 16 people my fam was able to reserve a private room seats about 40 50 and even get a free birthday cake which was merely the same buffet desserts prettily arranged on a plate w a candle in it The Mandarin speaking staff was friendly our empty plates were replaced often and the food was constantly restocked If you live in the area watch for coupons in the local mailers or print them out for the website We had a mailer coupon for 15 off that didn t list any restrictions for use on holidays but they wouldn t honor it even though we called weeks ago to confirm its validity It didn t beat the holiday spirit though the manager accommodated us w 10 and we were happy 3 5 stars for Super Star We ll def be back next year After gorging yourselves silly here it really won t matter if you ve been naughty or nice P 
7b-sB8BFmhV1g_I6fJUxwQ CMU Semi decent Chinese food in Princeton If you have no car to drive to Chuan Mei Zi this is the only choice you have Getting stir fries is usually a safe choice String beans is decent so is the pork tofu pepper stir fry no idea what the actual name is I tend to avoid any fish related dishes fish with chili oil is quite fisy and nonauthentic 
7gtMQo0MrQR9vDtn6pyRdg CMU Coming from a Chinese restaurant background I can tell you that PF Chang s is a bit over rated The prices are a bit high for the portion one gets and the food is a bit too salty You are mostly paying for the atmosphere The drinks are good but also overpriced I recommend one going to a local BYOB chinese restaurant like First Wok near Hightstown 
7isMeb4TUSyjXnm1-tanDw CMU I love coming here I ve have great authentic Chinese food here every time 
7tzE6Iy1emxxMJxRvTUHQg CMU Tiger noodle is by far the best Chinese around Nothing comes close to this place I ve eaten here for years and they know me by name and are super friendly I wouldn t eat Chinese anywhere else this place is a must And that s coming from a vegetarian 
7X7CVOZV2KzXBU3ZafBB3Q CMU I am a great fan of this restaurant and have been a patron for many years The owners are wonderful warm folks and always treat us well The decor is modern rather than traditional Chinese and is quite comfortable Hot Wok is not a typical Chinese restaurant It is a small restaurant with a limited menu and many of the dishes are the owners family recipes The food is always fresh the restaurant is extremely clean Service is always extremely courteous and quick This is a small restaurant with a touch of gastronomic class Some of the really interesting dishes are Mongolian lamb Shredded pork and dried tofu Shrimp with shallot chips dry no sauce This is not a fancy restaurant and I would not drive an hour to get there but if you are in the Princeton or West Windsor area and enjoy Chinese food by all means give this place a try Ask the owners for their recommendations By the way their lunch menu is a great value Charlie 
8Kn8ya_R62bCMaNYnCfRGA CMU The minute you walk into this restaurant you ll know it s a old fashion canto style Chinese restaurant The environment can use some updates There are complimentary homemade duck sauce with fried wonton noodles on the table the severs English not good so don t expect them to answer much questions The food is okay There s the real Chinese and the Americanized Chinese I ordered black bean beef tastes good but very oily If I have to dine in i would come back but if not I prefer getting the real Chinese food at the Asian market five minutes away 
8LNRDSZ96G_3cIANNZxf2w CMU I originally was going to give this a 3 3 5 if I could do halves but our waitress just made the experience so much better I bumped it up to a 4 Yes it s a chain Chinese food restaurant so give it a break it s still good Better then you or I could probably make And it has vegetarian options which I love it has it s own little section to make it easier to find The waitress asked us from the start if we had any dietary or food allergens I loved that she did that it was the first time anyone has ever asked and it is much appreciated We ordered the Vegetarian Lettuce Wraps as an appetizer yummmmm It hit the taste buds so perfectly I wish there were more then 3 lettuce pieces but we still ate the leftover tofu mix I ordered the Buddha Feast stir fry and Steve got the Ma Po Tofu It says the Ma Po Tofu is spicy but it really wasn t that spicy and it was so good The tofu was perfect I don t know what was so perfect about it but it was The Buddha Feast was just as delicious so many veggies with such great tasting sauce all atop white rice Perfect dish The waitress was helpful at all times and asked us questions about being vegetarian and Steve being vegan It was nice to see her engage in conversation I know some people don t like it but I do Customer service I love it The decor is really nice I like the atmosphere and I like the bar area I like that you can actually sit at the bar and eat your food and not feel so cramped we didn t eat there but I passed by I would definitely say try this on a week night I hear on weekends it s mobbed but it is worth a try I m sure we will be back one day we re more Mom n Pop but we can deviate once in a while 
8prdscNfZkgPRUtyDiMP9w CMU I always hear people raving about this nationwide Chinese food chain but frankly I don t understand all the hype as I found nothing on the menu to be impressive Why is there a two hour wait It s average commerical esque Chinese food The ambiance is ok the place gives off modern and trendy vibe Check out the nutritional facts on their website perhaps you ll skip eating here but then again this is America and people don t care what the ingest 
8vFaNGe49eRzBOfuVMwn4Q CMU went last night beautiful night not crowded at all excellent service excellent entres we enjoyed the usual suspects like the chinese style saute string beans which we want to be buried with and the pork with dried tofu jesus of nazareth that was good we also like that the serving platters are like circa 1974 corning ware plates and NEVER match a fancy restaurant is nice sometimes but we are uber casual and prefer a place where we can get comfy as we slurp up our cheap but omg tasty 11 champagne see the review of this stuff ivy garden rules it s like having dinner on the patio at home but with way better people watching AND you don t have to do the dishes PLUS you get to feel like a big shot and tip generously because the prices are just so reasonable forget reasonable for the quality and tatstiness factor it s downright cheap it s official we LOVE this place 
8x19l7lS60MgsFMjtUwO1Q CMU They are BACK in business on 571 across from the Princeton Junction train station The Sultan Wok in Princeton NJ 33 Princeton Hightstown Rd Princeton Junction NJ 08550 Tel 609 799 9666 Fax 609 799 9661 Love their on line ordering system It makes it so easy to order from the office particularly when a group of us are working late 
90tppZ2CEcjxbFMzCQQVvQ CMU Outstanding food outstanding service My only negative is that this location is so far to get to However it s still very much worth it 
9Au4GuGU9YmceNUvsQ9HjQ CMU I ve been to several of these but none in NJ and until now all of them quite good I know it s all relative when one says quite good to Americanized Asian food So last night we actually drove one hour through flooded side streets and dark back roads in a very Harold and Kumar fashion in search of that all elusive schezuan egg rolls and ma po tofus Unfortunately our ending was no where as satisfying as their s in White Castle We ordered schezuan asparagus ma po tofu stir fry eggplant and a sake drink The meals were so salty that I felt as if I just emptied a carton of morton s in me We actually had to send our meals back since they were too salty to eat We were of course still hungry but now debated what can we possibly order that the chef can t screw up We chose a chocolate cake Impossible to screw that up especially since it requires very little of the chef s favorite ingredient salt Lesson learned don t go there again unless we re in the mood for salt as a main course 
9fcGWYeyYLslUD2_W-XjMw CMU i don t i don t know if i can stay awake through this review group of 30 ate so much sushi yakatori beef and noodles tilapia all these little cakes cookies mac n cheese soft serve ice cream general tso s chicken more other chicken more more pants cutting off circulation good food mass quantities mad cheap coupons on website if you are in the area and hungry gooo food coma snoring ensues oh and Fiona was an EXCELLENT waitress 
9JCL-sTxnGDWY-1pyTgSRw CMU Great foods Long waiting lines especially on weekends though Better make a reservation 
9nwOnxYSLhmiwY_ph5TFtQ CMU We went for a quick lunch from work Food is good but portions are small covered with a large portion of rice Service was so rushed that the bill was placed on the table when the meals were served Why not put the bill on the table after the ordering is done 
9pbXDIBQoMz9PgPHFBE2iw CMU i used to study in Princeton My office is very close to nassau st Ivy Garden was one of the places I went very often for lunch and dinner The food was so so Not very tasty but still reasonable enough to stuff my stomach However the noodle there was good I ordered the noodle during my birthday and my friends who are American liked it too 
9yRIInbI6wgzcSD4KJwgqw CMU This place has become a mainstay of mine Silly cheap fresh food with great service Your waiter will probably be a won not sure of the spelling who is a pleasure to deal with Hunan shrimp is my favorite amazing for 8 95 Shrimp roll appetizer from the Vietnamese menu fresh and healthy made with basil and a side of shredded carrots radish 3 95 also recommend the seafood pancake 8 95 Lo mein rice dishes run around 7 Get to know the staff and owner as all are wonderful people BYOB WIFI and free parking in the back just put this place over the top Cash only 
A5JHLGFwrFRusjyuA1fm5g CMU I came into this restaurant with my business partner at 8 55pm and the hours of operation on the door were posted that they were open until 9 30 The waitress was very impatient and said the cook was going home and that we must hurry She was very rude to say the least The food came and was mediocre at best Then when the bill was brought to our table she again was rude and impatient I gave her a 20 and a credit card for the balance She charged the credit card the whole amount and brought the 20 back broke down into smaller bills When I asked for a receipt for the credit they would not give it to me and said it was taken care of Now I am left dealing with my credit card company to dispute the charge I would not recommend this restaurant based on the poor customer service or the quality of the food 
AApchtgrza6ofHeh-_2D8g CMU I haven t been to this place in years and was decently surprised with the braised beef noodle soup for lunch You can t beat a warm and satisfying bowl of soup on a cold day for 10 bucks including tax and tip 
ADx60yIW9GtAzZOAMtN70w CMU The food is good no doubt about that But the manager and the people who work there are just horrible Particularly the manager he didnt even know how to arrange a table for 14 people he put a square table and round table together and told us that is it And when we asked him for a better place to sit He became very angry and told me to calm down A very bad experience infront of the clients and then after that every thing was an issue They were not at all interested in serving us and make it little better BTB this is in the Princeton Location I know they dont care about one such incident because they are fully packed always But just wanted to let you all know that if you are going as a large group this may not be the right place 
Ah7nqZ6X8sTHBYzk0-4XiQ CMU I m writing this review for the regular food loving people out there I read a lot of reviews about how this food isn t that great or this or that Madness if you ask me I love PF Changs Have I ever eaten at a 5 star restaurant in New York No Like I said I can only speak for the every day people But this Chinese food is great It s a really good place to go and split entrees with friends as well they sort of encourage the family style eating I love PF Changs If you re a first timer get the Chicken Lettuce Wraps thank me later 
AjVvIVoUjy69IB2xGvxnMA CMU This restaurant is located in the Hyatt I came here three twice during my stay First I was starving so I came here to get a quick bite I sat at the bar The bartender was nice and professional I was trying to order but then another bartender came in a started yapping away about work gossip very UNPROFESSIONAL She was distracting him so I couldn t order She wasn t pleasant either always had a frown on her face Must be part of a union I got popcorn shrimp which was tasty and generous but not worth 14 Second MUCH better experience It was 11 30pm and my friends and I were starving I asked the guy behind the bar if they were still serving food He was really nice and enthusiastic and said the kitchen was open until midnight He gladly took our orders and then put some tables together for us in the lounge area I think his name is Dave I got a Caesar salad which was one of the best ones I ve had large portion and plently of dressing The fried oyster was a nice touch 
avjobLdQx2hdFFV8HrJiwQ CMU Service is gruff but not unfriendly except the hostess who was pretty rude Prices average for the area Menu offerings nothing special Lunch specials are a healthy portion though they do look small because the rice and main part of the dish come on separate plates bowls Wonton soup was bland with tiny dumplings that were 3x as much dough as filling 
aX2rAHscewuOKo2QiFJ-vg CMU Good 
b4D6oFcVhZ1hIncwIsWNIw CMU I ve had so many different dining experiences here all for lunch that I wasn t sure what to give this place I know that ownership has changed several times the restaurant name has changed too but I know this for sure only come here for the Shanghainese food preferably the Shanghai dim sum Don t get the dim sum off the carts that has been inconsistent and usually not good However my last dining experience was very positive and I would ve given 4 stars if it weren t for the previous experiences 1 Xiao long bao pork soup buns great Sometimes in the past the dough would be on the thicker side but this time they were really good I hope it stays that way so I don t have to travel 30 min to my other Shanghainese restaurant 2 Shanghai pan fried noodles with shredded pork spinach not bad There were a couple noodles that must not have been cooked thoroughly bc there were a couple of noodles that were hard 3 Shredded beef with hot peppers noodle soup very tasty The beef itself was not too spicy but there were plenty of hot peppers to make it hot and the soup of course was spicy I m willing to go back and give this place another go I m happy that my dad convinced me that the food had gotten better than previous experiences but I ll need another solid meal before I can be convinced 
B5WJ0QWetNSO1sZnVTSTVQ CMU Not that great A typical Americanized Chinese restaurant not really for Chinese Maybe good for American 
b7kc_NnAz_hjojRmPb2Eow CMU After having read the reviews I decided to go here for lunch today I was quite indecisive on what to order I asked some questions about items on the lunch menu and the man and woman up front were friendly However when the man asked if I spoke Chinese I said no I do speak Chinese but not conversationally so I didn t even want to bother explaining though I ended up explaining for whatever reason He was nice enough to make some recommendations and alternatives which was great but what he said next was like a slap in the face He noted that a section of the lunch menu was more authentic Chinese and that I probably didn t know that Excuse me How dare you judge me A customer A first time customer I sucked it up and explained I knew what the items were and that I ve had it before Anyway The food came out super quick and I was out of there in no time But still that comment left a sour note in my mind Despite all of that I ended up with the family style tofu with brown rice and hot and sour soup I love the fact that they had brown rice available You rarely if not ever see that in Chinese restaurants in Boston The food was good but the sauce for the tofu was super oily The hot and sour soup had everything but the hot and sour That was a bit disappointing Despite being insulted the food was good For under 10 you get a decent amount of food definitely not enough for an average male for the entree and the soup was generously portioned Will I be back I don t know 
b7vIjwNsuoJmTeloWz_0ow CMU It s not as great as some people make it seem Of course it s better than locate Chinese food takeout The Kungpao Chicken was so salty I m curious if the people who cooked it taste the food themselves before serving it to customers Because there s no way they took a bit of the Kungpao Chicken and said it was perfect I got my daily sodium intake by taking one bit of the chicken The Lettuce Wrap was pretty good My boyfriend and I were able to get a second bowl of rice since we still had a lot of the main course leftover but no rice We got the 2 for 40 But there s no way I will pay more than that My boyfriend and I couldn t stop laughing at the mini dessert The 2 for 40 comes with two mini dessert or one large one They re serious when they say mini We got the tiramusu and great wall of chocolate Both delicious 
B9s_KhbpUmGl0op4IOo4qA CMU Yikes came back here for dim sum and it was atrocious For freezer resuscitated dim sum I feel I could ve made better choices the dumplings were among the most unappealing that I ve ever had and the pork buns were almost equally deplorable Soup buns are still good though 
bBj66rL_sImAlxN9XXTJkA CMU Service was terrible there was a piece of a bone in my rice but the meal itself wasn t bad However it wasn t anything to brag about either The waiter was taking a personal call and failed to bring the bill in a timely manner as a result We weren t even told good bye on the way out 
bhHy0UFKrkWJPW2mXjr2Eg CMU Decently authentic 
bJZOnamCB9U9fMx5wQfKKA CMU The food is amazing I recommend the soup dumplings 
BRCApys53k330fbSy5c5KA CMU I ve been here a few times and enjoy the food It s sorta family style as far as portion size and I love the tofu broccoli It s spicy and filling I absolutly love the Fried Banana with coconut ice cream and the chocolate cake with raspberry drizzle desserts They are to die for Prices are a little high to med but typical for the area All around it is a great place to eat for groups and I never had a bad waitress 
bSyWl4qi7b0qwgiV855iHQ CMU Food is good typical Chinese buffet Nothing more than expected other than the oysters Went for lunch got sushi hot food self serve lo mein thing etc Was getting my last plate and doing my round and there I saw oysters Got excited and scared at the same time cause it is a buffet and I didn t know how fresh it would be Anyways got one oyster to try No lemon to be found asked a staff member She brought it to our table and said oysters are for dinner you want me to charge you for dinner or lunch We said lunch of course Then we said that it didn t say dinner and she said yes there s a sign But truly there was no sign there when we got it Whatever So she took my husbands plate of 3 oysters and I said how about my one lonely oyster and she said it was ok and walked away OMG didn t get to see where she walked to but was she going to put that back for other customers to take What if it was touched tasted or something Ugh guess that s Chinese buffets for you BIG ICK We questioned ourselves that but also said to ourselves we shouldn t have asked for lemons But anyway my one oyster was delicious 
BtxJEi-20dreGZ5NlSCngg CMU I ve been here quite a few times for lunch with coworkers I really enjoy their noodle soups and fried rice Great value and excellent taste Be sure to bring someone that speaks Chinese in order to try the REAL Specials That s what I really enjoyed while I was here 
Bu9hW-d6_dhLhVoTj5Uv8w CMU True the service is perfunctory at best True everything costs 1 or 2 more than it should I also imagine that much of the menu is not so great But the xiao long bao are good so are some of the soups and noodles and noodle soups I imagine a Chinese speaker could really make the most of this place Not being one I still think it s pretty decent There s a reason that most of the reviews for this place are 3 and 4 stars It will not make you forget NYC or Philadelphia But it s your best bet in the area 
bvn0SmAie27UTSGta08edg CMU Okay I m from Jersey Land of big hair and strip malls And generally I get nervous when I visit a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall Especially a restaurant where the patrons seemed to upset the yellow white balance although granted the Indian customers weren t quite white or yellow But man I was impressed by the quality of the food I promised myself I would stop the gorging after this week of gluttony Unfortunately I wasn t expecting such a good meal Especially as I said from a restaurant tucked away in a strip mall next to an Italian restaurant with cheesy Italian opera blaring away But I guess with the Plainsboro population growing they know their Chinese food The tastiness we ordered included Stir fried crab w egg Lotus root with squid Tofu with golden mushrooms Homestyle duck I was busy licking my plate clean My only beef with the place was their rice was dry Not sticky Just dry How do you mess up rice Sad times But still for central Jersey I ll give it a five star rating My taste buds are rejoicing but my stomach is hating me Actually probably more like the scale is hating me right about now Thank goodness for my metabolism 
bxrYPCth6hCVYvIwA71VTw CMU Don t understand why there s always people there The place is not big There s nothing special about the food I think it taste the same as other Chinese restaurant at the corner Ivy Garden 
c6SmcCskMxbVT0hbxIbRXw CMU Located in the front of an enormous shopping center this restaurant has the availability of hundreds of people who march in and out in flocks before and after their shopping extravaganzas As my friend and I walked in we were told of the 45 minute wait for a table so we scurried to the bar in hopes to find two adjacent seats Luckily we did The food was of course superb I started with the egg drop soup a nice classic that never fails here I moved on to the beef lo mein which wasn t greasy or over seasoned The portion was more than adequate but not Cheesecake Factory sized thank god I finished off with the banana spring rolls which weren t as aesthetically pleasing as the other courses but overwhelmed my senses with delicious flavors that contrasted its appearances The main thing that I noticed in this PF Chang s compared to others was that I felt like I was in a herd of animals being ushered in to quickly eat from the trough and then leave in one mass together When I go out to dinner 3 things matter like they do for most people 1 The atmosphere is nice PF Chang s CHECK 2 The food intensely delicious PF Chang s CHECK 3 I can take the time to enjoy myself rather than not being able to remember the experience PF Chang s FAIL I was able to have great conversations with my friend which reminded me that I had little to no conversation with the bartender minus the ordering of our items The poor gentleman had barely a chance to breathe let alone speak to his guests to form any rapport whatsoever Overall I still love PF Chang s as I always have Just not this one 
CA5H3wkuH2U4WZJ6nEsNbw CMU This is my favorite buffet place in the Princeton area They have a good variety of food and the food is more authentic than place like PF Chang The person who complained about the sugary goo well what does walnut and shrimp is suppose to taste like The people who complain does not know what Chinese food is suppose to be Come on American people go to PF Chang and Tiger Noodle When you look in look at what kind of people are in there There are a lot of Asian there So think people More Asian good Chinese food And who goes to PF Chang and Tiger Noodle Enough said One thing I do not eat the American food there and I would not eat the dim sum section It s just a waste of time They have Peking Duck there you re not going to find this in PF Chang Tiger Noodle and yes Peking Duck is very greasy 
caZjjmbozlQyY8J9492Ujg CMU If you re looking for Americanized Chinese food I guess here s the place to go It caters to the working white professionals in the Plainsboro area so lunchtime can get pretty busy The food isn t bad really Just not quite authentic It s found its nice niche in the palates of the American suburbanites so hasn t quite tried to deviate from the niche It s still thankfully a step up from Karen s restaurant in Princeton but definitely nothing exciting Beating Karen s btw is a feat that doesn t require much bragging rights They have a little lunch buffet on weekdays again for the lunching professionals Dishes are simple lo mein potstickers shrimp in lobster sauce All a little bit greasy and a little cold I prefer the lunch specials that come with soup and rice The steamed fish was surprisingly good and simple with a large portion for the price Perhaps the one standout It s been a while since I ve been there for dinner but from what I can remember the dishes were more of the same American Chinese cuisine Not bad tasting but a little heavy on the oil and the western modifications 
CbcOcP-Qgljp8yLMv1DZOg CMU I grew up in Princeton Junction and Lotus Garden is the best and most authentic Chinese restaurant in the area The service is always friendly and the food is terrific My favorite is the spicy beef with dry bean curd I don t even like tofu but they have perfected this dish It s one of my all time favorites I would eat there every day if only I didn t move out and live close to Chinatown in NY I would say Lotus Garden would be able to hold its own on Canal Street 
ccoMYd8ab35eko40cqd5Ng CMU The dimsum on the weekend is awesome Within a 30 mile radius of Princeton I don t think any other restaurant every comes close I use to come here every other week or so when I lived in Princeton Even now when I go back I would always go to Shanghai Park to try their dim sum Two of my friends had their wedding banquet here and they got the chefs here to cook an awesome 10 course meal none of which appears on the menu The regular menu is pretty good too A shanghai friend tells me that the food there is pretty authentic but you need to know what to order The braised fish stomach is really good and so is the yellow chives with beef Another one of my favorites is cilantro beef soup 
CE3iao6XmtXhXcNXkADd0A CMU The food is awesome I always come here with my family This is one of the best Chinese restaurant in central NJ They have just started the delivery service So now I can enjoy their tasty food at home 
CeNT-phbOqYUL5sUhKNVIQ CMU Best Chinese Ever I can t believe there are bad reviews on here I have been going to Tiger Noodles since I was 4 or 5 years old and it has just gotten better The people who work there are great the food is amazing and I live in NY now try and find better steamed veggie dumplings I double dog dare you and now that they have expanded there are more seating options Eating outside in the summer Nothing better Cold sesame noodles and chicken moo shoo are YUM Wonton soup Perfect If you could marry chinese food I would do it here Seriously Yelpers This place is awesome 
cM-sLJq-2NMeLOePmqHvVg CMU Decent to good food at fair prices but rude service from the phone inquiry to the check This is not the first time we ve experienced such service here of course it pretty much ruins the meal Marginally better when it was called Great Wall but it s gotten worse Would thus recommend for takeout or emergencies only 
CPcjmnfMqAkx8Tm1Fmfr7w CMU There is one dish in particular that I have at least 1 2 times a week Being a meat eater I surprise myself in telling you that it s the Bean Curd with Broccoli dish It s simple clean DELICIOUS It is prepared the same way every single time I order it no variations no experimentation This dish is usually served for dinner only the portion size is generous You can order it for lunch but they will tell you that it will be dinner size at the dinner price which is around 8 Remember the Sex The City episode where Miranda orders her usual Chinese take out and the woman on the other end laughs and says I know you Well that s exactly what it s like here and that s fine by me 
cT1QQ8FpChbjKWrile1oiA CMU Not a very clean or cozy place but decent food The acoustics suck There was a table of girls laughing it up and the sound was so amplified we couldn t hear each other 
CtEgh4rY1IAWS_17behh1g CMU A good place to go on a second date especially if it s not too crowded The ambiance is quite lovely it s dark and romantic The drinks are excellent The first thing you have to know about the food is that EVERYTHING is frozen and shipped to the individual restaurants nothing is actually created on premises This explains the small and uniform portion sizes Once I found this out I lost most of my interest in coming here That said some of the noodle dishes are sort of yummy The service is normally very good although during one memorable negative visit there was this large family sitting in a corner that was letting their 2 young children run amok throughout the entire restaurant and NOBODY asked them to control their children At one point the kids tried to crawl under our table and I m pretty sure I scared them into submission with some well placed Anglo Saxon phrases That alone was enough to not really make me want to come back very often That said it s definitely something you should experience once For a repeat experience I d recommend Sunny Garden a few blocks over 
D0msSHPfPIlA3ANhAaI78A CMU Overall good experience for a pricy chain Kids liked it which is a big plus for us always 
D1vqcEqLYfiGA99v8EMygQ CMU The scope of this review is very narrow This is only for take out and for their beef noodle soup The person who took my order looked like the owner and was friendly Always had a smile Hmmm It seemed that he was the only one there who was smiling Anyways It s hard to get good beef noodle soup in the area After you have the ones from Taiwan nothing really seems to compare The beef noodle soup here has a way to go but still pretty good Soup was flavorful I asked them to add small spicy and it turned out just right Beef was good and tender Was hoping for more tendon though They used udon noodles Personal choice but I would like the noodles to be thinner Price is a tad on the high side with 9 and change for just the beef noodle soup Even though it s pricey Yay I m a fan until something better comes along 
d2pXTeJIguLMGWQWPxLk3A CMU I was ready to bash this place with a 1 star review due to the fact that it took over 2 hours and 20 minutes to receive the small delivery I gave them a call at the 2 hr mark and was told the delivery guy is on the way It was a Sunday night therefore the it s busy excuse was not a good one Once arrived I made sure to check that food is hot and does not look re heated Delivery guy apologized and quickly accepted my request for a discount and gave me 2 off of 16 don t hate me I did give him a 25 tip Since the food was fresh and the delivery guy was nice I will give them the benefit of the doubt and rate the food objectively Ming s Garden did exceed my expectations as the Princeton area lacks decent Chinese food for the most part Though not good enough to warrant 4 stars the price was right and the food is solid The cold sesame noodles a simple dish was pre mixed with above average noodles Chinese Curry Chicken generally tends to be quite bland but Ming s version of it had a pleasant kick to it with properly sauteed crisp vegetables Heavy on the onion but still superior to many places around here Finally the Beef Chow Mein was an interesting experience as it lacked noodles My significant other had mentioned this is sometimes the case but I made sure that the description contained white rice fried noodles before ordering Though it was borderline mushy the rest of the dish did beat my expectations while missing the noodle part If I were able to I d rate Ming s Garden 3 and 1 2 stars the food was solid and I ve paid too much for far worse Chinese in the area Worthy of a re visit if I am in the mood 
DAPBo6sh_sstohVUz0yS8Q CMU Man the place was packed on a Thursday at 12 30pm Not sure being on St Pattie s Day and the first day of the NCAA adds how many standard deviations to the norm We had to take the last two spots by the bar counter Ordered the Calamari Mongolian Beef and Orange Shrimp from the pre fix Food is consistently a little heavy in both taste and look This is definitely not a place for either fresh catch from the tank or thousand year old egg 
dGOYibeGsTAZ2D8kjw-DgA CMU Being a Princeton University employee I have had many chances to eat all around Princeton Usually for lunch we go to the Ivy Garden when we want Chinese however the other day Ivy Garden was closed during our lunch We decided to venture down to Tiger Noodles I was very disappointed by the food there I ordered the General Tso s which just tasted like fried chicken drenched in Tabasco Hot Sauce The portions were smaller than the Ivy Garden and the service was no where near as friendly In my opinion if you are in Princeton and you want Chinese go 2 blocks closer to campus for the Ivy Garden 
DsVqLCj8XD4h-70KfIWU7w CMU Decent enough takeot for Princeton although if you re looking for a sit down place I would definitely head 3 stores down to Sushi Palace instead That being said this is a solid option if you are looking for a quick inexpensive meal to go The pepper steak is nicely seasoned and pretty tender and the garlic chicken is enerously portioned A step up from the Ivy Garden for sure And it s cheaper too 
DTteRkAyQ7cprAMm7hEHJg CMU What a disgrace to Chinese people everywhere My last experience with Tiger Noodles is just that my last Terrible rude service Sent us the wrong food and acted as if it was OUR fault My duck soup didn t have roasted duck as in bone in skin on variety It was cut into julienne strips i m assuming so it can be rendered as dry as possible for the person trying to eat it Flavorless I don t know what the other reviewers are smoking 
dytgGmFB9m9PHLfJaalsLA CMU The GOOD it s a nice dining room and the circular tables with the Lazy Susan are good for big groups The waiters are nice It s got a killer name I mean Ya Ya Noodles just sounds yummy So good job to the guy who picked the name Also they give some great crispy things to dip in duck sauce when you sit down The sauce on the food is good The BAD the food isn t all that great Best to order something that cannot be doctored like Lo Mein The UGLY I get the feeling they insert a third element into their general tso s chicken that you don t notice till the food cools a bit so it s hard to enjoy the second half of your plate They aren t alone half of all Chinese restaurants in America seem to have very suspect ingredients It makes me feel that they don t go the extra mile when preparing the food 
edx1DlnMuWogypkgOOxkNg CMU My family and I come here to eat at least once a month Very tasty and consistent things we crave are The beef tendon tossed in spicy szechuan style oil and Chinese wine marinated chicken Both cheap and REALLY good Recently they started adding sushi to their menu The rolls are done pretty well and the flavors are not bad at all for the grade of fish they are getting It s also fun when the sushi guys throw us a tasting of something random First time was some cooked whitefish meat mixed with some mayo and sriracha or something and crispy panko bread crumbs and more mayo sauce on the bottom Tasty little cooked tartare Second time like 2 weeks later it was some crab tartare kind of thing Tasty The stir fried Udon house noodles are SURPRISINGLY good and I NEVER order stir fried noodles lol Just felt like a filling 8 dollar dish 
EFQfwHaOs45SsgKmWBkUhw CMU i am not a chinese man although i do play one on tv no i don t really tiger noodles has the best dumplings in town and they make a few really good dishes the staff is pretty friendly and the outdoor seating is nice princeton has seen a wave of restaurants with outdoor seating these last few years i think for the most part it s a hit what s not a hit is the outdoor seating at the blue point grill next door they recently expanded their seating between the sidewalk and the curb there is seating out front to the sidewalk then they leave the sidewalk clear and start seating again along the curb so you can sit next to someones 1994 toyota what happens when the occupents of that car return to get in it and how about when they start it up how is everything can i get you some more exhaust fumes for your overpriced swordfish sir oh yeah i was reviewing tiger noodles tiger noodles menu seems to be about 3 too expensive for every dish i just can t fall into the whole hey it s princeton line of thinking too expensive is too expensive regardless of location hey it s princeton might work if i was seated atop the grad school tower or on the steps of ole nass or the patio of drumthwacket but on the side of the building along nassau street eek me thinks not don t get me wrong tho tiger noodles is pretty good it s byob it s quick usually tasty and a pretty vibrant atmosphere they could do a better job on the saute string beans and last week we had a VERY poor excuse for broccoli in garlic sauce i swear they used hot wings sauce to flavor that dish i wanted to send it back but associate taster my better half is really reluctant to do that kind of thing because she s sooooooo sweet and kind she s also a broccoli slut and would eat it if it was served over crayons and roofing nails with motor oil ok ok tiger noodles is better than fair not as good as the ivy garden but we d go again order their dumplings they really are quite delicious and delicate how s that 
ElZ2ELzuaSiVOX6d3XgKeQ CMU There are not many reasons to come to Plainsboro but Lotus Garden is one of them I ordered the eggdrop soup best ever with steamed pork dumplings amazing with a steam chicken and veggie dish simply wonderful Nice dine in experience with speedy service and it was very crowded Oh this is important we were the only ones in the restuarant who were not Asian So where do people go for real Chinese food Lotus Garden 
eOw7xh4-H1SzlC2mAVPmGw CMU This place is where Ivy Garden used to be While Ivy used to be good this is probably the worst Chinese food in Princeton First of all they showed us the menu for lunch specials and when we sat down showed us a different menu which did not have lunch specials My kids love General Tso s Chicken so we always order it The General Tsos was more like stale sweet and sour chicken No wonder this place was empty during peak lunch time while all the other restaurants in the area were packed Efes Thai Noodles etc I will give this under 6 mos before it closes down 
EV0bj6DpdZ4ncbp2-ZrGjg CMU I ve been coming here every so often since it opened and I m still a big fan This buffet offers some pretty traditional items like things you would find for dim sum soup dumplings and the soft tofu dessert There is a great variety of things offered you are bound to find something you like I also appreciate the fact that they serve vegetables stir fried with REAL garlic not tossed in garlic sauce And for dessert you ve got to try the Chinese donuts with some vanilla soft serve on top The combo is killer great now I want some 
f-61-8ezrB3K-YrbxqKGtA CMU love this place great food great owner the lady works at the front sometimes is always nice and funny the food is excellent we mostly take out but ate once in and had a very nice and thoughtful waiter who accommodated us with our infant throughout our stay the food is always fresh and tasty 
f52CyoGnf4Yr-R64t2-wrw CMU MM MM MMMMM Absolutely perfect dinner Our Tofu dumpling style was superbly cooked crispy on the outside and tender on the inside With broccoli surrounding the dish in a stunning sauce We also had the eggplant in garlic sauce This eggplant was fantastic so soft it was almost creamy in a flavor bursting sauce Both dishes were served with a generous portion of rice My husband and I shared these dishes and there was plenty left over for tomorrow s breakfast lunch This place officially wins the spot as the best Chinese restaurant in Princeton Of course the competition is just sad I could probably eat this for dinner every single night and not get bored I highly recommend their vegetarian dishes Though other places have more selection none are as satisfying as this 
f6TcSuSMSZn4yqCtfbAmRA CMU For its price it really is as good as it gets You can get lunch for 5 How awesome is that In Princeton I ve recently also tried the lemon grass chicken or something like that It looks like a really light curry and is excellent with white rice Highly recommend AND they carry grape fanta How awesome is that I only wish I had found this place a year or two ago and not when I m so close to leaving Princeton 
FAwHq3JTyBY0UfJlj3YCww CMU This place is just plain mediocre Boy do I wish it were better There isn t much competition Chinese food in Princeton is sadly lacking Our current favorite is Yao s in Montgomery We only go to Shanghai Park if we are desperate 
fCltRiJrvewqTdi6PWUEQQ CMU I m actually surprised by the bad ratings this place gets I come here with my family a lot and my whole family happens to be Shanghainese If they think it s good I m willing to bet it must be pretty authentic I wouldn t consider myself some sort of Shanghainese food connoisseur but I think this place is okay too The xiao long bao soup dumplings are super good that s probably half the reason we always come back haha I ve never been here for anything other than dinner so never tried the sushi or dim sum so I can t tell you anything about that Oh and whatever you do do NOT get the bubble tea The milk tea was okay at best and the bubbles were AWFUL and I worked at a bubble tea shop so I DEFINITELY know my bubble tea 
fjrITN0sY7Q8EYDMYAlkWw CMU My friend wanted a place in Jersey that served dinner and bubble tea That s not a common combo around here so only a few choices came to mind We decided to come here and were very happy we did There were four adults and one child my little buddy K who LOVES egg drop soup I ordered a Honey Dew Green Tea with bubbles and milk milk is optional The tapioca balls were a little mushier than I prefer but in a bind I m not gonna complain For our dining pleasure we ordered the following Appetizers Scallion Pancake Not too greasy One order was plenty for us Steamed Juicy Pork Bun You get 8 DELICIOUS Share it Courses Kung Pao Tofu with Peanuts General Tso s Tofu I usually shy away from Kung Pao and General Tso dishes However these two tofu dishes are super tasty I can t stop thinking about em Chicken in Black Bean Sauce What can I say Just get it Pork Loin Peppercorn Salt It s fried boneless pieces of pork with a little spicy kick The above was a LOT of yummy food we had to take about 1 3 home If you want some yummy food served with a smile head on over 
fnl8GJOByA6NhF0P_QUcXw CMU One day in Princeton we were in search of a Chinese restaurant We heard some good reviews about Tiger Noodles so we decided to try it The food was pretty decent nothing special Regular lo mein and chow mein The egg rolls weren t bad though Our waitress was a bit rude when she came over and said gonna order Later we heard her say what the heck are ya doin to another table Anyway the food was decent and I would go back again 
FnPRkod0iKNLDvcwN7v7fw CMU I know that I m supposed to say that I harbor disdain for this place because it is a chain restaurant but after a few visits it just wouldn t be honest To start the atmosphere is very nice with great ambient lighting and nice touches like creative light fixtures and a marble bar The drinks from every bartender I ve had are made excellently especially by the mid 30 s bartender with shorter blonde hair who can make a kick arse dirty martini The drawback is that any time I ve visited on any day of the week its always packed however different from most chains they DO take reservations We visited for dinner and got the Ma Po Tofu insanely good perfectly prepared tofu Coconut Curry Vegetables and Tofu a really nice balance not too sweet as some coconut dishes can be and Sezchuan style scallops only marginal on this one served with limp not snappy snow peas Our waiter was excellently attentive and we were overall pleased with the experience Also you can view a version of their menu with nutritional information which also includes some tips on ordering your meal customized to fit your dietary needs i e made in vegetable broth instead of oil to avoid fats its a brave thing for a high volume chain to make available and I really appreciated being able to go online prior to visiting and ruling out some of the ones with more outrageous calorie counts 
FZZZGqpR5TGM5stfmqvV0A CMU I travel to China a few times a year and this is the closes to real Chinese food that is like what I eat out in the provinces outside Beijing I ve only been a few times so far though my 5 y o son is already addicted to the red bean paste pancakes What is more known as peasant food in China is perfectly remade here served family style the only thing they re missing are the big lazy susans seen on the tables in China This is usually inexpensive vegetables cooked quickly and served with really tasty sauces not the real heavy thick goop you get from your basic chinese take out These are much lighter and fresher tastes They also do a really good job of cucumbers with garlic ask them to give you the brown vinegar that should be served with it My menu choices have been limited but everything tastes like it does when I m in China really good Also there s something to be said about going there and seeing that most of the clientele is actually Asian and probaby predominantly Chinese Always a good sign in my book I d say the food is 4 stars but as the other reviewer said the layout and decor leave a bit to be desired I wouldn t hold that against a place that just serves good food but it isn t a 4 star kind of place anyway Like many of the best places I ve eaten in China it s about the food not the looks 
g1pVa3mfH_lapOOhoq-bnA CMU I was very pleased with the szechuan chicken I ordered The vegetables were crisp and maintained their flavor in the not too overly done sauce I would definitely come back here and recommend it to friends 
Gk30kydGW2mPqALhVJR8Og CMU This is really the only Chinese restaurant worth eating at in the Princeton area As other reviewers have said the weekend dim sum is all overpriced the dim sum dishes they make on site like the red bean pancakes are good but the pre frozen dumplings are just terrible However the everyday food is reliably good and fairly priced if not cheap I m not sure why people complain about the service I ve never had a problem with it and I ve been going there for years As far as dishes go I m particularly fond of the Shanghai wonton soup the soft tofu with crabmeat the clams with black bean sauce and the soup buns with pork and crabmeat 
GLJW7s7FwB2W2rtbKazW5A CMU An average American Chinese dining experience in a beautiful city Slightly overpriced as you might expect Food and service are both very good Outside dining in the summer is a treat 
gNLAY1pCDfrVXiYsCQaoZQ CMU Tiger Noodles has a pretty broad typical Chinese menu My friend and I had the Sesame Chicken and Mango Chicken The Sesame Chicken had fantastic sauce but the chicken was disgusting The mango chicken sauce tasted kind of artificial I won t be rushing back Sunny Garden on Rte 1 is much better 
GNOMgfBHqeyNZCdQBcXigg CMU Two points choose your food wisely take a Chinese friend if possible and consider them for your wedding 1 I wasn t all that inspired by this place at first But then I went with a Chinese friend who ordered for us and the food was VERY VERY good My favorites are the scallops in black pepper sauce the fish in rice wine sauce and the mok duck appetizer So If you know what you re ordering this place can be excellent There s just too much on the menu In some ways I wish they d reduce the menu by about half so that everything you can order will be good 2 After eating very well here we decided to have our wedding at the restaurant The price quoted to us was unbeatable really ask the owner he s a great guy and the price was simply without compare We didn t go crazy on decor but they put some thought into making the place look nice The owner was very helpful in selecting a menu And then the food We have a lot of food snob friends who told us afterward unsolicited that it was the best food they d ever eaten at a wedding And though the hours we d selected were fairly short and our reception ran long the staff didn t kick us out or anything they just started seating other people which because we were all seated together was not an issue They were unbelievably nice unintrusive professional and considerate And the food was excellent 
GoDxGJ633z5BY8uLvzAxUw CMU This place just opened in August It s located in the same shopping center as Whole Foods After talking with the owner most of her veggies were grown in her own organic garden The wonton soup is top notch I had the General Tso s chicken and they use only white meat It was a Little on the doughy side but the sauce was really good and it was nice and crispy My wife had duck and she loved it The duck was fresh and the skin was nice and crispy as she likes We ll definitely be going back Just wend back again and the food was great Have to warn you the service isn t that great but once you get past that the food is good 
gtIiUNDyONpD7BkrNztlKA CMU A great little place As soon as we walked in the hosts were friendly always a good sign Me and some girls had made a reservation there for almost 17 people only 7 of whom showed up and they didn t mind it at all Though we did feel sorta bad The food was good and they gave us quite a few extra dishes for no added charge Very nice of them Over all the food was average service average and the restaurant itself was alright too Seems like a good place to meet a few friends for lunch EDIT Seems that my other local chain fave Tiger Noodles bought them out But they re even better so don t worry 
gTTO8Dl29G23RYGX0dA6Gw CMU I believe that this is the place I m still learning how to determine the names locations of places which appear to have multiple addresses street names as well as towns It s NJ and I ve been recommended to not try to figure it out The setting is in a mall and the service prompt A lot of items on the lunch menu so I opted for the spicy chopped chicken with fried rice and wonton soup Asked for the dish to be served spicy and wasn t disappointed Tea was immediately served Rice I usually don t like fried rice because it s served overly sweet and with who knows what This one was different instead of omelette there were strands of scrambled egg The rice was not in a clump instead simply lightly flavoured and kept as individual pieces with a soothing flavour Wonton soup good broth neither oily nor MSG laden refreshing The wontons were the thinner type of wrapping usually seen in high end Chinese restaurants with a sweeter pork ginger scallion filling much like the type in bun Chicken lots of vegetables and tender chicken thinner sauce which wasn t overly sweet like at most places instead filled with ginger lots of chile and vegetables al dente Total with tax and before tip 7 50 Next time I ll have my husband join me This was one of the best Chinese meals I ve had in awhile 
gUQ0qgbMYwIpO_xfgMu27Q CMU Ya Ya is very good General Tso s is my favorite dish and they do a great job with it Also the bubble tea is very good The location is totally off on Yelp It s located in the Montgomery Shopping Center near the corner of 518 and 206 
GV2KBuH-eJPMGXvBQI_YxA CMU Good food standard Chinese fare done exceptionally well Atmosphere is stunning Caloric information is available which is a plus You will have to wait for a while to get a seat unless you get reservations Always always get reservations Not the best place for kids in my opinion It may take a while for you to get your food too but it will be delicious well done and in my experience done correctly Service courteousness correctness was first class 
gv8hshEMasuoJoFGdmk3jg CMU For a chain restaurant this is pretty good I have had a couple of dishes that were good but they must put Crack in the Kung Pao Chicken I like it that much I also think that PF Changs is also the spot that made Chicken Lettuce Wraps so popular Calamari is decent as well This is a standard go to back up choice for me but it can be a pain because you will almost always wait without a reservation unless you like to eat dinner at 5 Take note and call ahead Or better yet get takeout I was a huge fan of this place when it first opened but having tried other places I realize it s good just not THE GOODS 
gyspIFa1ODc16vqKJu3VAw CMU Out of all the Chinese restaurants I ve been to around Princeton Ivy Garden Tiger Noodles Shanghai Park I d have to say this is the best I say best cuz I still think all of these restaurants have no serious competition Again I could have a bias in regards to Chinese food but I think San Jose beats all these places hands down Food quality was alright Standard and kinda uninspired They did carry yo teow sp and do jian so that kinda made my day but otherwise if anyone asks me of what I think of Chinese in Princeton I d say save yourself and go to New York Pricey too yech The first time I came here we ended up tipping around 10 cuz the service was horrendous We waited forever for them to take our order and gave us some attitude while we were still deciding What really set me off though was the fact that after this the waitress had the nerve to look at the check and demand more right in front of us WTF I was leaning towards a higher tip prior to this as my friends are a little conservative on tips in general but once she pulled this crap that sealed the deal In fact thinking of the ordeal s pisses me off so much that instead of giving em 3 stars as I had originally planned imma give them 2 Pros Best Chinese food in Princeton Cons Service Taste Where s the competition Verdict I might come here with a friend but only if they want to go 
h4AC0GpSQdGaquqKvL72nA CMU I love this place It s a riot If you want a cheap but massively huge buffet with everything from fried chicken to dumplings to every color jello imaginable this is the place for you I went with a group of friends one ended up feeling sick and lying on a bench outside but the rest of us gorged ourselves You might feel sick for days afterwards but it s worth it 
HB0GZuz8UfrpMmQycU1_wg CMU We avoided this place for awhile The reason Overpopulated most of the time There s a great open garden during better weather We stopped in tonight and were immediately seated They have whole fried flounder not parts as most places do but the entire fish lightly battered and fried And duck whole duck roasted perfectly and chopped so we could each have parts Some crunchier legs others tender Skin cooked so that it could be eaten Then the sauces as perfectly done as would a French chef Including the one served with the egg roll Spicy and made with real chiles Then the chopped chiles in oil more chile than oil And the sauce for the flounder which we had served on the side and dipped everything into Then tossed some onto the rice Then took the rest home Balanced layered and no MSG headache Service They left us alone Opened our bottle Refilled our waterglasses Served food when it was ready asked whether we were enjoying things Then left alone the way I like it Such a happy meal The best Chinese food we ve had in town or recently So good we picked up a to go menu on the way out and lunch is 6 50 7 Cheaper than Karen s but so much better We re definitely returning even if only for the duck Update 4 12 09 We now come here nearly every week for the whole fried flounder sauce on the side the unfinished sauce taken home each time because it really is that good with vegetables plain rice as a scallop marinade anything really Mongolian lamb was good but not superlative A little too sticky sweet for my taste with a hint of molasses The place has not been crowded in awhile which is fine for us Once the weather finally improves the patio will again be packed The interiour is a bit ugly but who really cares when the food is so good that we return again and again Edit 4 14 I won t downgrade this place because we love their fried flounder and will return repeatedly for it weekly if possible but there are some things we have to remember 1 specials might be wierd On Easter we ordered the bunny special It was primarily rib meat and bones A good flavour but way too much work Kind of like kimchee basted rabbit connective tissue There was no bite which didn t have something to spit out 2 appetizers they re good but not great we had the meat skewers and spring rolls fried I thought they would be the cold version but seriously they re merely ok The service is prompt and great and we will continue to eat here for their incredible flounder and duck Weekly is what it has become but now that we re looking for a house it may be bi weekly Still what they do great we ll be fans of and come back for gladly but the other stuff Leave it Update 6 6 09 I ve vowed to get their curry ever since we first started dining here a few months ago each time the plate came by for another table I started drooling and wasn t disappointed The chicken is tender there s excellent flavour with a medium heat level by my standards and the vegetables sauteed but with a bite more cooked than a stir fry but that is how it ought to be Now I know where to get my Chinese curry fix which is almost as good as my mother s Thank you Ivy Garden Update 10 18 09 I hope this was an off day but I m not feeling generous today and will ding them a star The flounder was perfect but the duck a bit greasy Then that amazing sauce for the flounder it was BLAND Zero flavour Cornstarch with brown colouring We didn t even bother finishing or taking anything home a first for us So we re 2 2 in terms of places going bad on Nassau since we moved first Old World Pizza now this place 
HC2u8WJS_xHwEpdcI2AuFA CMU This place is quite inconsistent Some days they have horrible service some days their food are not that good Other times they do just fine I ve had Hanami about 10 12 times and have been pleased with their food overall One caveat I realized is that their delivery food tastes way worse than dining in so I stick to Sushi for deliveries I remember enjoying their japanese bento plate a lot which contained items more interesting than your usual teriyaki tempura Also I enjoy ordering from their tea menu a lot though some of the items can be overly sweet For sushi the quality of the fish was always good but the sushi itself had ups and downs Oh and I found their new style sushi disgusting On the contrary if you can get the fat futo maki style spicy rolls they are amazing I also remember ordering sushi omakase which contained worse fish than their sushi plates lunch specials Overall good but very inconsistent place which can become frustrating not to get the quality you expect It also does not help that the prices are on the high side 
hDixCnCBBOfdpITln9ozSQ CMU Not the biggest fan of this place due to being standard in every way It was cheap but no credit cards allows at all A bit in the oily and dry side too I mean they really do have everything you want and its under 8 bucks but you might aswell go somewhere else Pretty americanized for the most part 
hgh6M-lIByRKMb8s5Epk4w CMU For those who need reviews by Chinese people for Chinese restaurants I m Chinese American born and am happy to say that I ve been coming to this restaurant since I was in middle school and I m 34 now The people are very nice and the food is great Like any place some dishes are better than others but I recommend the following 1 Pan fried noodles 2 Popcorn chicken 3 Shrimp stuffed tofu 4 Sauteed fish Give it a try you won t be disappointed It s my husband s favorite local restaurant and a real treat 
HLqVQIyx0TeABiKmYOkS-w CMU My experience at P F Chang s certainly will make me think twice about turning my nose up at the mention of eating at a chain restaurant No this is not authentic Chinese food so if you go into this place expecting that you will probably be a little disappointed If you can put your elitist persona aside for an hour or two and you find yourself in the Princeton area I would highly recommend P F Chang s located in the Market Fair shopping center on Route 1 My boyfriend and I met my mom dad and grandfather here on Sunday for lunch since it s the halfway point in between our locations We were seated immediately at a round table that offered plenty of space to accommodate the five of us Our server came to take our drink and appetizer orders about a minute later We ordered the appetizer sampler which had crab rangoon three types of dumplings pork vegetable and shrimp which you can order steamed or fried we chose steamed an egg roll a spring roll and various delicious dipping sauces I sampled the steamed vegetable and shrimp dumplings with their respective sauce pairings and they were packed with flavor The spring roll was delicious and not too greasy which is my main gripe with most spring rolls and the duck sauce was a perfect complement Since it was lunch time the restaurant offers a special Lunch Bowl menu I ordered the Honey Chicken which came with choice of white or brown rice and Egg Drop or Hot and Sour soup for 7 95 Not a bad price at all The soup was delivered first a few minutes after we placed our order I ordered Egg Drop which is usually very thick and gooey and I was pleasantly surprised by its consistency It was more like a soup than a gel thankfully and was packed with vegetables also unlike typical Egg Drop soup The food was delivered very quickly just when we finished our soups at the perfect temperature The portions were huge especially for the price My Honey Chicken was moist flavorful and had the perfect amount of sauce I really hate when I order something from a Chinese place and it has more sauce than meat and that was definitely not the case here I was very impressed with the quality of the food Last but not least was the excellent service Our waiter was friendly and helpful delivered refills without being asked a huge plus in my book and got our orders 100 correct even brought an extra glass of ice for my mother s iced tea at her request which no server EVER remembers I wish I could remember the server s name because he was amazing Thank you P F Chang s for changing my opinion about chain restaurants 
HoP2rzc8N3Tw68Ake4Ffaw CMU First off they usually don t put chinese buffets in areas with a lot of chinese food available My first chinese food experience on the east coast Living in sf I have pretty high expectations for chinese food This place definately was not made for chinese people I feel like the food is aimed toward american The food is non authentic All the dishes are filled with tasty msg The dessert is left out on the dessert bar for god knows how long The pot stickers were hard as rocks Need I say more I m sticking to san francisco s chinese food thank you very much 
HqPJUw3AQGVom4yT1YsRYA CMU We order from them sometimes for catering events They are okay 
HvH73V_2Xf4PXEwhi8KTrQ CMU My boyfriend and I have only gone here for lunch so the prices are decent for the portion of food you get plus the soup or eggroll I like the wonton chips they give you when you first sit down Everything we ve ordered here has been pretty good The fried rice is very bland The service could be a lot better Every time I ve been here I ve always felt really rushed by the waiter waitress They always seem to want my order the second I sit down and ask things like soup eggroll rice when all s he needs to do is wait like 15 seconds for me to say my complete order I think the real reason we go here is because it s close to where we live 
HwGkR058YrnCpDzndEc6zg CMU I will always love Tiger Noodles They introduced me to udon noodles which I got again when I was in town in May The outdoor seating was wonderful on a nice sunny day The food is reasonable They only take cash which does suck So we had to run across the street to the grocery store to get some cash back with purchase A bit inconvenient but they didn t mind the weirdness of us running off to get cash to tip them with I really wish they had some Tiger Noodles in stock so I could rep them back in Boston Good solid food good service That s my Tiger Noodles 
I95tZUt8513ju7HRKIbFOQ CMU As a native Shanghaier this is one of the best Shanghai cuisine I have had in US Their soup bun is a must have Their special Shanghai dishes are very authentic and delicious 
IawY7K5ClGP8DlxQwaNjRg CMU This place is great for lunch They have a lunch menu which includes a side dish of spring roll or soup plus entree for like 6 95 Plus the best part is that they have a very extensive vegetarian menu and lunch special vegetarian menu I go here once a week and enjoy the broccoli with garlic sauce and vegetable spring roll Very good quick and the staff is really pleasant 
IdFJI1Sik8l_XrpcURAnwA CMU There are only two authentic Chinese restaurants in Mercer County NJ Shanghai Park in Princeton and Szechuan House in Hamilton Some of the authentic dishes at Shanghai include Xiao Long Bao steamed dumplings with a brothy filling and Shanghai Cu Mian thick stir fried noodles The Chinese menu is more thorough than the English So if you don t read Chinese and are adventurous take look around at the other tables Yes there are better choices in New York and Northern New Jersey but this is the best Chinese in Mercer 
IJI-evB-Zvrn2qal_T8HSg CMU This is quite possibly the most hilarious restaurant I have ever been to We initially went for a friend s birthday after she decided that she wanted really American Chinese food for her birthday dinner and so we chose Super Star because of its strong Texas motif Can you get more American than that Super Star is quite a big restaurant and they even offer a tour if you re so inclined A tour How strange is that There are three large sections of food ranging from more traditional Chinese items to chicken tenders and mac n cheese It s hilarious to see who in the restaurant is eating what most people seem to just have a plate of chicken tenders and jello But they do also have a mongolian bbq section and sushi to try in the back It s all included in the price so try some of everything The dessert bar is quite large a bit like a Las Vegas buffet in its options Little bite sized cakes frozen yogurt I m a sucker for do it yourself frozen yogurt toppings and an entire RAINBOW of jello options red orange yellow green blue yes even blue and purple Why I don t know but they offer it And fruit Super Star is located in the same strip mall as Walmart so parking is easy And you can sign up to be on their mailing list and they send you coupons in the mail 
ikVigMcz8KMiQyjXKE7v0g CMU My boyfriend his father and I were all so disappointed that Hanami had closed We love going there for dinner to catch up or after business meetings The decor was beautiful the staff were very kind and courteous and the food was the best asian fusion I ve had in a long time 
INO7Ab_62XTPTnEHip455w CMU The price is decent for the food that s offered I m always looking for some non standard traditional Chinese food and I get lucky here every now and then Besides the normal Chinese buffet set up there are plenty of extra dishes are are just stacked up between the trays These are usually the ones I go for since they re more interesting Generally the sauces aren t too salty or thick they offer lots of soups during dinner on the side near the ice cream their fish is always steamed so well and I enjoy finding little treasures every now and then 
iONnJ0-PnVQ9YdEUIoUp6g CMU Rolled down here on my way to the record exchange in Princeton We were kind of starving and we were checking out this Kitchen and Bath Store next door I didnt want Chinese Food but it was Saturday morning The sign said Dim Sum and that always works for me Another thing that drew my attention was the party of 12 Chinese People walking in That and there was a NY Times review I didnt read it but I figured it was a good sign I went in and we grabbed a seat It took a long time for the waiter to stop by our table Meanwhile there were several people that walked in after us and they were all taken care of I don t want to pull the race card but they were all Chinese It was our table and a couple of gringos sitting on one end of the restaurant We ordered some things off the one little dinky dim sum cart they had It all was sitting there and it was pretty terrible The only thing that kept its integrity were the rice in lotus leaf We bailed on dim sum and I ordered pea shoots of the menu and some soup dumplings Soup dumplings were thick I guess it s a sure fire way not to screw them up Pea shoots were oily and not done all that well Yes they did not prepare a simple plate of pea shoots well If I lived in the area I guess I would go here for soup dumplings then I would try and make nice with the waiters and hopefully they would teach me about the menu items the table of Chinese People were ordering Because they certainly werent eating the bull shit they served us Whatever it was a fluke that I went and will never go back If you live in the area and you don t speak Chinese you will have to do some work to get a decent meal and service out of here Never refilled tea or waters 
irxKzI-ItxTtDF1t0FjHxw CMU A step above the buffets around Chicagoland Super Star East has a pretty wide selection of cantonese food seafood and dim sum items They have a huge variety of dim sum items including steamed pork and shrimp dumplings clams in black bean sauce sticky rice with sausage pan fried turnip cake etc Some of the items were really disappointing such as the pan fried cakes which tasted different perhaps spoiled We were really impressed by the pork sandwiches which had thinly sliced pieces of roasted peking duck marinated in a bbq sauce and chives between slices of steamed bread The dessert selection was pretty good a lot of standard items and some rare such as the black sesame rice balls and bean curd in syrup They also have mongolian bbq and a sushi bar that comes with the buffet 
iz6lO6WELCCN1YgD_oYoPQ CMU I came here looking for decent Chinese food and yet again I ve been disappointed with Princeton s selection I ordered their beef noodles my favorite dish and found the soup to be lacking in flavor The beef was aight but I felt very underwhelmed with my bowl If that weren t bad enough the noodles cost like 8 I felt seriously fleeced I ve sampled some of the other food here but like Janelle said this place seems pretty standard They have nice outdoor seating though so I guess thats a plus Pros Outdoor seating can be pleasant Cons Beef noodles were overpriced AND underwhelming Verdict Another pan for one of Princeton s so called restaurants 
IzqDO0ygFya4kl7kymjjsA CMU This places uses a ton of MSG which is why I prefer Ivy Garden over it If you re okay with MSG however you ll probably like Tiger Noodles more as their dishes bring out a lot of favor But pretty much all of their dishes taste the same due to so much MSG Good dishes Beef with Garlic and Tomatoes the tomato pieces are larger than optimal but it s not a big deal Chicken with Eggplant standard good tasting chicken with eggplant General Tso Sesame chicken Comes with 3 pieces of brocolli Try to pair it up with other dishes that include veggies Chicken Vegetable Noodles I got this when I was sick and wanted to eat some chicken for proteins It was really good It also comes with chinese cabbage napa chang bai cai carrots snow peas mushroom and broccoli Beef Stew Noodle Soup nowhere near as spicy as Ivy Garden s Stay away from Pork in Garlic Sauce and the specials The specials aren t special at all They re just plain dishes 
J18GiCWpj1UCnjyyU_L3Kg CMU Please note Cash Only Tiger Noodles had never been on my radar for places to eat out Still the outside dining area always looks inviting so I decided to give the place a shot on a nice late summer evening Thanks to the other reviews I decided to try the Thai Silver Noodles and was pleasantly surprised Hit all the flavor notes I look for spicy salty sweet citrusy The spicy thai chicken was ok The scallion pancake was pretty good and I liked the shrimp dumplings Overall a decent meal at a good price BYOB is nice And sitting outside is very pleasant Not accepting credit cards was the only buzzkill 
j6MX_h2IJs9CJFOUj7TbTg CMU This place is AMAZING My family and I have been going here since they opened and we eat there religiously The owners are extremely friendly which helps aid the amazing experience we have every time we go At this point we are on a first name basis with them and they know what to bring us before we even sit down and order They really do make us feel like we are at home Not to mention the food is unbelievable I often find myself upset when going to other places that the food I get isn t any where near the quality taste or authenticity that I get with Hot Wok I moved to CT for four years and would make a point of getting Hot Wok every time I came back to West Windsor I also refused to eat chinese while living in CT because it didn t compare 
j9ttqlu5gS2U-GJ1mZtvcQ CMU I think something is wrong with the address since the place didn t let me check in but the food was cheap good and etc The fried dumplings had thick skin moo shu had more cabbage than i wanted it to the fried rice was good Not very oily and a good go to take out asian place that does delivery over 15 I like how they take credit cards too 
JBXEdK-OhKfQcJpry2j8vA CMU Just get the crab wontons take out and call it a motherfucken day 
jd8wm9SBq7xypP7t2jXyNQ CMU After being on the road for a couple of weeks I was really starting to miss all the food we have back home Lucky for me not too far from the University was a little Chinese restaurant where I could order some dumplings and Anh Choy I don t think I spelled that right oh well The shop is located on what appeared to be the town s restaurant row With several establishments about 3 4 quarters full Their menu has the standard assortment of dishes nothing hardcore that you would typically find written on a white board LOL I was just happy to be eating something other than steak or hamburgers Don t get me wrong I love my bone in ribeye served a perfect medium rare but sometimes I like to keep it simple Hmmm 
JEx1pGcgKmzoikSdWjmzfg CMU Best Chinese food in the Princeton area One thing that they do for me when I ask them is that they will create a BBQ pork and eggplant in garlic sauce To me this means that they are very customer focused in the way they approach pleasing people 
jhhXkYOP8X_xh6KnceH-9Q CMU This is the kind of Chinese food that was naturally selected out of the american restaurant pallet when PF Chang s came around But it survives in Princeton because it is a BYOB place popular with underage college students who happy bring their own The food is not very tasty and no one in my party of 15 people finished their plate the other night Some claim the best item are the Scallion Pancakes but really they re just fried dough with a bit of green onion in there The decor on the inside is stark and worn so dine on the terrace if you go Either not good enough or not cheap enough but I can t decide which 
ji-Lha7D5vIwJfz-ar6jGQ CMU Little bit of everything noodle soup will make your life complete 
jIFMN6pseT6sYW57JYi_Pw CMU sunny garden makes delicious chinese food and is pretty and spacious it also has nice service if you are into super authentic chinatown fare this might not be your kind of place but then again if you are stuck in central nj you may just have to make do i like my chinese food slightly americanized and think sunny garden s food is delicious that and i also liked the gigantic pumpkin they had on display last time i went 
Jm5q32HaemsFtig7nmkJ6w CMU Had a mini family gathering here and were pretty disappointed The food here is overpriced for what you get which is barely enough We ordered a bunch of dishes for variety but ended up getting small portions of salty food There are other P F Chang s that came out better than this one 
jRju-APs3CNm44KbLzAhJg CMU The food is soooo homy It was a different owner when I lived in Princeton I visited there again in November and the owner was changed I tried their food and it was very good so fat I went there every time when I was in town again First of all I looooove their beef stew It is just like the way I tasted back home The beef is very tender and I know it s not easy to cook it just right The portion is huge so I often pack half to go The lamb stew is great too I like lamb but hard to find a place to cook it well because the original lamb smell is not easy to be covered by sauce The chef cooks it very well to cover the smell yumm love it I also recommend their wonton soup Often you will find the wonton with thick pastry and pork never know what quality of the meat it is in most Chinese restaurants or take aways But they used thiner pastry not the thinest I usually eat back home but good enough in the US and with lots of shrimp in the filling That s what we call Cantonese style Last but not least price is very reasonable It s my number one choice and I will bring my friends over to the restaurant next time 
JU5vy4m0cALLsougQbUlDg CMU delicious http www youtube com watch v xQkATGaVZt8 
K2peOqxYgRWAb_ymvo520w CMU Shanghai Park has some pretty decent offerings especially the dumplings Soup dumplings xiaolongbao are as good as you are going to get around Princeton and the steamed vegetarian dumplings suzhengjiao are even better The stir fried rice cake chao niangao is also pretty darn tasty The menu is quite extensive but a lot of the other dishes fall flat Another negative point is the service which can be downright surly even if you re a steady customer 
k2WXZrjyaPCIq7T5yi8xDw CMU Cheap but not very good Bubble tea also only okay 
k6rEFIuZUnGp6hPp-WHNKA CMU Average value okay food Nothing memorable Decent sushi Good assortment of soup Avoid crawfish and crab shell stuffed with sticky rice Overall an acceptable Chinese buffet for this region 
K7m9UMDB-6rQJsmnHhdrPg CMU Went for dinner on March 2 Midway through first plate girlfriend notices roach big enough to drag off a newborn baby walking right on the buffet the one next to the grill Fork down immediate exit Even after pointing out to the staff still had to pay full price for dinner Won t be back 
k8GKDP78UmA9cAHNCmdFLQ CMU The trick is to order off the Chinese language menu I know this isn t easy for non Chinese speakers and I was lucky to have my mandarin speaking in laws with me but it s worth the effort They specialize in Shanghai cuisine so that s what we ordered The jelly fish noodles were bright and interesting the chive dumplings were crunchy and full of fresh chives and the water spinach with fermented red tofu was exquisite In other words order authentic Chinese food and you ll be pleased They call the dishes dim sum but really it s just standard Shanghainese small plates We didn t order any of the dim sum classics more associated with Cantonese food shrimp dumplings pork buns etc Maybe that s why a lot of people were disappointed Because they ordered Cantonese food at a Shanghainese restaurant 
K9bCLJnHttLpevoOB3Ne8A CMU Very good and very cheap I ve only had their food to go They have a very delicious vegetarian hot and sour soup They also have a delicious vegetarian fried rice 
kInp7lrHnJVdinbPGhTG8w CMU As a Chinese I find the food here relatively well made American Chinese taste Definitely Oily Yes But compared to some of the other buffets I ve been to this one is pretty good The sushi is one of my favorite If you can t find something remember to ask They have a huge selection Remember to try their specialty soup and the soy bean curd only available on some days 
kmI_X1I-0GUTc3uwXQDGCA CMU This Was TERRIBLE I actually made an account just so I could express my dissatisfaction with with this restaurant My roommate and I ordered four or five dishes which came to about 60 pricey but we were hungry and assumed it d be worth it The chicken with garlic sauce was a dish of overcooked vegetables with a garnishing of chicken morsels the beef schezuan came in what appeared to be sewer water the vegetable spring rolls were passable I SUPPOSE don t get me started on their crispy duck more akin to the fattiest piece of carrion you will ever see I have never ever had worse chinese food The fact that we actually paid money a lot at that to eat added insult to an already painful injury I only wish I could tell everyone who is thinking of walking into that place to save their money and spend it on somewhere that will give them a less painfully unique culinary experience 
KqcyAoDqlP9s8YgUIE8gyQ CMU I ve eaten here 8 10 times dine in and ordered takeout quite a bit Everything I ve tried is delicious especially the General Tso Tofu and General Tso Cauliflower The restaurant is spacious with a relaxing atmosphere and the service is pleasant I tried to order takeout today only to discover that they ve closed for good I m quite sad about it but at least they still have the Princeton location 
kQIBjd_hAQWht_NIhgF9yg CMU I ended up at Shanghai park by surprise It was rainy I was starving I was skeptical after having been grossly disappointed after trying tiger noodles and the Ivy garden The atmosphere is nice nicely decorated with comfortable booths or tables to sit at The first thing that struck me was the number of food servers There were about 7 waiters for only a couple of occupied tables and they all stood around watching me and my husband pour our tea We thought it was hilarious They were sweet though The tea was lovely fragrant and flavorful We started out with the tuna maki Nice generous portions of fish fresh and soft Though on the small side for a 6 pc roll For the main course we shared a shanghai noodle spinach and substituted tofu for the pork It was definitely tasty The tofu was really really good I would definitely come here again and order more sushi Its better than Tomo on Nassau Also I would want to try the dim sum 
krPH8ozII_eJT-b7ltHdtg CMU Came back from NYC and had a HUGE hankering for xiao long bao I wondered should I turn around and go back to Chinatown No no time So I Yelped it and voila found Shanghai Park The dumplings fabulous And I ordered the scallion pancake to boot That was a bit thicker than I normally have had it but it and the sauce it comes with was delicious The xiao long bao was scrummy yummy goodness They had 6 dumplings for the same price you d get 8 in NYC but I can deal with it Much has been said here about the surly behavior You go here for the food not the pleasantries That s all I ate but the table ahead of me ordered some type of noodle dish that intrigued me UPDATE I have been back several times Be sure to order the pan fried noodles with either chicken or beef Absolutely delicious But go order the soup dumplings and you won t be sorry 
KuI0Q4OOhwDy_Q3_3HsLww CMU Standard Chinese food in Princeton with lots of outside seating I m more of a Tiger Noodles kinda gal 
kxIxLDky7PAKwYl9sMU-cw CMU This is not the place for vegetarians or people with food allergies As our party contained both we explained to the waitstaff that we could not under any circumstances be served anything containing fish meat or egg However when our vegetarian spring rolls were served we had a tough time discerning whether they tasted like fish unidentifiable meat or simply garbage And although they all went uneaten they were cleared from the table without inquiry In fact at no time did anyone ask us how the food was it was obvously not a point of interest The vegetable entrees were fresh but covered in an unpleasant sauce the origin of which was difficult to discern and forget we all left feeling like we needed to brush our teeth and days later I still feel like there is a numbing film on my tongue 
K_VnUOufJ8J9rkWVp0a8yg CMU Nothing like ur chinatown and flushing noodle shops a bit americanized i suppose but decent for the area I also like it because they have half way decent bubble tea here keep in mind i like mind REALLY sweet I usually go here if i just want a light lunch bowl o noodles and some bubble tea I think its a bit more authentic than many other restaurants like it in the area 
k__tiTDBusLKNYKxYEB2rg CMU I ve only ever eaten the Thai Silver noodle and had the bubble boba tea to drink The thai silver noodle is made with thin rice noodles and the sauce is nicely flavored and spicy However the noodles are a bit greasy The bubble tea is good but the tapioca doesn t taste quite right and the texture is a bit off I ve definitely had better but this quenched my bubble tea cravings I ve eaten in and the service was good When I ve ordered takeout it was ready promptly Decent prices It s good for a quick decent meal at a reasonable price Note CASH ONLY 
l3qtfsOs-Xro0iX-GFvsqQ CMU We really like Lotus Garden order dinner from here regularly Their lunch special is a great deal too and they re quick 
L8IQeAYd4h2DHjydojJEgg CMU This is probably the best Chinese restaurant around the Princeton area I haven t found a place better than this The food here is pretty good very satisfying to eat I always go for the pork buns whenever I come here as the appetizers The pork buns and the sauce they give you to dip the buns in are to die for The pork buns are very flavorful and juicy to eat It comes in 6 buns each in the steamer and I usually go for two sets of them with one set for each person as I come to the place only with a friend Actually the black sauce with ginger in it is a special thing to be had as I can dunk anything in it and it will taste good I always wondered how they made it For the entree I have tasted the Beef with Pepper in Special Sauce Diced Chicken with Hot Pepper Sauce and Peanuts Sauteed Chinese Watercress with Garlic Cloves and Whole Fish with Hot Bean Sauce All of these dishes are quite good First the Chinese Watercress dish isn t as garlicky as I had hoped but it is a decent vegetable dish The portions are generous for each of these dishes As for the Beef dish you must be aware that it is spicy with the green peppers My friend who eats spicy food can even say it is spicy so don t take lightly with the spiciness Moving onto the Diced Chicken dish it is delicious and the peanuts add a nice crunch Lastly the Whole Fish dish is decent as well as they slather the fish with the Hot Bean sauce but it is not as hot as it should be and the black bean flavor doesn t really come through in the dish It is a bit pricey for the fish and as always you need to watch out for the bones Overall whenever I am in Princeton I love going to Shanghai Park The food isn t too bland like many Chinese restaurants have it to cater to non Asian tastes If you are in the area then this is a place to try 
LbLDTgTaKwfW18CnSWD5Ig CMU Great value for money I got the garlic chicken and the portion was very generous The chicken and all the vegetables were really really fresh Will be back here many many times It was a shame to see such a great place so empty 
lF7oaVlGj0XX1zttq-1djw CMU After reading the other reviews I have to wonder if we re talking about the same place The food here is very good IMO especially for those who are a bit tired of the super huge and greasy portions that usually pass for Chinese food in the US The Authentic Chinese menu is awesome and I usually get some scallion pancakes to go with every order The lunch menu is cheap but good even though the portions are a bit smaller and the hot and sour soup tastes well the way hot and sour soup ought to taste I ve always found the employees very nice and helpful as well although I am Chinese and do speak Chinese pretty decently so that might have had an effect I can t say In any case I consider this one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area 
LGAdk9RH6Ttw5QTQg6xvOg CMU Not just noodles they have the best soup dumplings i e Steamed Juicy Pork Crabmeat Buns ANYWHERE Not starchy or fatty like you find at other restaurants I prefer their soup dumplings to ones from Chinatown NYC or anywhere else We always order the Chicken Chow Fun too They also serve bubble tea 
Lkl4hNBA2bzS7KIam9ptUA CMU Nothing special Just like any other Chinese Restaurant I wouldn t go back 
LkSOFMD4HPJAtTZ31kxOxw CMU Cheapest sit down restaurant in Princeton bar none Generous portions of food even if they tend to go a little heavy on the sauces Lighting needs to be improved 
LodjrJYPkpI45ERBEZzWxg CMU I was in the area and in the mood for some Japanese food and heard about the new Hanami that opened up in Princeton Since I ve had great experiences with the one in Westwood this was a no brainer The service and food were excellent just like the one in Westwood The menus were similar but the prices were a little higher Nontheless I was very satisfied Try the crab salad 
lOZh_wbOZSEMZ3HqKpszbg CMU Just like many reviews on Yelp the service is terrible They barely acknowledge you and ignore some of your requests simple ones like can I have mustard Typically I just get take out from here and avoid the rudeness altogether but tonight I decided to eat there I always thought that it must be a great restaurant because there are so many asians there Now I realize that this place specifically caters to chinese customers and it explains a lot about why the food isn t very good I mean its ok and never been flat out terrible but I feel like we are missing out on the more adventurous cuisine If you can find a better chinese restaurant in the area I would skip this place Unfortunately I m not sure there are any 
ls0SLgSGHn82Wg6exbsw9w CMU Decent chinese takeout I tried their curry chicken with brown rice I actually enjoyed it I went here with no expectation and the place delivered They had too much onions which I actually enjoyed because I love onions They can put a touch more chicken but they give enough Id go back again and try another entree 
lUzft2VQ1EqIYBzQ5UHjVg CMU Below par Chinese food I think I recognized the dumplings that you can buy in bulk frozen food at Sam s club I won t be going back 
LxfSTICVm90gS-KavJlyUQ CMU We were just here for dinner and were terribly upset with the service The waiter was extremely rude and i felt like he would bite my head off if I did not place the order within 2 secs The food was ok 
M-Eg_9pb44OkYpq9LPCS_g CMU Our group dinner was held here last night and although the service was fantastic the food was just okay The spicy salmon roll was a bit fishy tasting and the sesame chicken tasted the same as the walnut shrimp which tasted the same as the sweet and sour pork It was as if they had one ubiquitous sauce The chicken lettuce wraps were pretty good and the pan fried noodles well seasoned and perfectly crispy The fried rice was flavorful without being overly greasy although the egg shreds were not exactly Chinatown quality Overall a good choice in Princeton The fruit plate at thee end was a nice touch with fresh cuts of pineapple grapes melons and strawberries Because oranges are getting kinda old seriously Ambiance is lovely and they have plenty of space for parties I would highly recommend renting out the back room for that purpose Oh and you can bring your alcoholic beverages and they will serve mix etc Pretty convenient when you re catering to a group of 50 
m0uxWJ805Bw8xuKeqP4YHw CMU I really like P F Chang s in general The few locations I have been to have been very consistent the service has been great and those vegetarian lettuce wraps are worth the trip alone Another recommendation would be the Dynamite Shrimp if you like things on the spicy side On the visit to this location however we lost a reservation because we were ten minutes late and my main dish of Ma Po Tofu was good but did not seem to be of the same caliber from previous experience in other places 
m9ILzXxuf7oBviVou14ldw CMU My wife and I checked this place out twice The second time was just to make sure that when we got sick the first time it was really because of this place and not something else Sadly the food was quite tasty My favorites were the pepper chicken pork dumplings cheesy fried wontons I m an addict and the spicy tuna and spicy crab rolls I say that it s sad the food was tasty because it sent us both to the bathroom with bad gastrointestinal pains both times and she doesn t eat the spicy food As much as I liked the food I have to put this on our never again list 
MBALvCAqipEe_3DBPWpYmg CMU Extremely bland and tasteless though probably not the worst you can have around here After being recommended by multiple old American people I had tried this place out food is just oily taste wise lackluster even added soy sauce does not quite fill the emptiness in taste Better than being bad i guess 
mbYh-GMNMT6gxNfL_TZDqw CMU This place was packed when I got here for lunch on a Friday Ginger chicken with green beans and brown rice beans lightly braised ginger pieces stuck to my teeth I personally prefer them unauthentically grated to a fine pulp and the sauce a little too sweet for my palate Wonton soup Good A thinner wonton skin would be better but that s just me 8 tip An okay place 
MiN_CxupVz8jYOKuIudxNQ CMU SO Much MSG I was very thirsty for the rest of the day It was a relatively big and nicely decorated restaurant There are very few Chinese restaurant to choose from in this neighborhood So there are definitely people who come here for what they think is authentic chinese food The authentic part of chinese meals are located in the back of the menu book 1 page only The daily specials are posted on the board as you walk in The selections are very limited Unfortunately despite the nice looking restaurant with very friendly staffs the food just wasn t good enough for me to make another trip here 
mMjcSWtr5eTSKwssBsnzPA CMU 1 Overpriced 2 Mediocre food there isn t much right next to market fair perhaps but Market fair isn t exactly located near anything at all really so there s a good chance that wherever you came from to get to PF Changs has better Chinese food I m not talking authentic or whatever I mean just plain BETTER 3 Service is variable but the hostesses have been incredibly rude every time If one person in your party is missing they will not even put your name down which is a problem because there is usually a wait for dinner I have no qualms with chain restaurants PF Changs just isn t that great Overpriced mediocre food mediocre service Avoid it if you can 
Mpp50MS9Urst7WJXNvYyEw CMU I really want to love Tiger Noodles From the outside this small modest noodle shop on the main drag of a college town wants to scream unbelievably awesome food in a totally unexpected setting Unfortunately it s just shrugs a believably ok and done before The food itself gets 4 stars It s fairly standard but decent Chinese fare The beef chow fun beef noodles and beef with tomato are my favorites I m not a fan of their pork with preserved cabbage noodles because they add bean sprouts and carrots I recognize that this is a personal preference One star is removed due to the crowding of tables When two average sized adults are sitting back to back both are wedged into their seats tightly When a larger than average person sits down no one can reasonably sit back to back This has happened to me Service has always been hit or miss but not enough in either direction to add or deduct stars While it may not be a noodle shop love it will remain a good like 
mV2GIix84LXteGqaFLP3jw CMU I think the trick is to order the non standard Chinese American Dishes The usual suspects are OK ie General Kung Pau With Broccoli With Garlic Black Bean The usual soups hot and sour egg drop wonton are I think from the same supplier that makes it for everyone else But the other dishes are creative and the only reason I gave this place 4 stars The beef with sliced jalapeno is great probably not authentic there is an excellent bitter green soup with fish I had a beef noodle soup once that was nice as well I ve figured out that the trick here is to order stuff that I ve never seen in other restaurants Maybe its a novely thing or that I have no basis of comparison But this strategy works for me 
NcPrGsfv5qUCnB-_bDvZqw CMU Solid Chinese delivery take out I ve eaten here a lot and never had a bad experience 
nDqpx2AEBqr3ro2emFVpvg CMU I worked in marketfair for about 4 5 years and never went to sunny garden the former hanami however i knew how much it was beloved and enjoyed So when looking for somewhere to have a late ish friday night dinner with the SO we decided to drive over and see if Hanami was any good It s Chinese food but in a really beautiful environment Perfect for groups as many familes and girls night outs and groups of couples were enjoying We were seated immediately and our server came around to take our drink order Now a big note this place is BYOB We totallly neglected this and taht was the one downside of our experience since SO likes to have a little wine or cocktail with his meal However they have fun tea drinks that they make He got a fruity one that was good a little too sweet for me They feature Japanese and Chinese food and have a full sushi bar Will have to check that our next time but SO got a raw tuna dish served over seasoned rice and I got the spicy chicken eggplant shrimp and squid plate with brown rice So good And there were several pieces of jumbo shrimp in the dish The serving was perfect enough to fill me up and enough to bring home to enjoy later Will definitely check this place our again when we are looking for a place when we go out with friends for dinner date night This time with some wine from Trader Joe s 
NFT76wE3YTpz4jxKjmZ7nw CMU From the microwaveable safe rice container the scorching hot soup and the most tender white meat chicken around this place is hands down the best Chinese food I ve ever eaten Only place I m more inclined to order a meat entree than seafood probably anywhere and by no fault of the seafood Pork chicken and beef they re all fantastic The dumplings are the best I ve had and I ordered them steamed not fried Have yet to eat in only take out and delivery but I m eager to try 
nFtRiVjVLRoLmmw-ub0JBw CMU We ended up at this restaurant because we had no reservations made at any other restaurants in Princeton Initially I was not too excited about this place When you enter the restaurant you see the kitchen very clean and then on your left you see a small door which has a note CASH ONLY You enter in thru that door and you see the rest of the restaurant I must say it is a hole in the wall restaurant So we were seated and we ordered the appetizer it was awesome at this point I was happy that we ended up at this restaurant Then I orderd the hot and sour soup ummmmmmmmmmmm my mouth waters every time I think about it Then we ordered mango tofu it is soooooooooo good My husband never eats tofu but he loved it He wants to go back for just the Tofu Overall the food is really tasty The service is quick Not at all expensive Perfect restaurant for a nice meal I am going back to this restaurant for sure 
nk0BOG-PjoqOo_gjUk-T3w CMU A bit far to walk but that s what carpooling is for Lunch specials are great the food is fresh and not overly greasy and the service was very fast The portions are very generous and for under 6 you get an entree rice and side You won t find a better deal in Princeton 
nLzW5_DVNf1tFcNR4qcrTQ CMU Ok food Very few good dishes Great ambiance but not worth the crazy LONG WAIT so hate it Avoid going here at all cost 
nnyoaRDuZuj-dCW4z-aFTw CMU LOVE this place People don t realize that they deliver all over Princeton and the food is always there really fast and it s still nice and hot when it gets there We love the General s Chicken which is as good as any we ve found in the area And the Lo Mein is really good not too dark They seem to have a very good grasp on spicy vs not spicy also When we ask for extra spicy it s really spicy but when we ask for not spicy the stuff is mild enough for the kids Highly recommend this place We ve tried every place in Princeton for delivery and this is the best AND the cheapest 
npMHmEd4aZd1w8AoSc5ICw CMU We ordered the onion pancakes beef noodle soup with tendons and beef chow fun Onion pancakes were good The beef noodle soup was ok but nothing special Beef chow fun was terrible Noodle were over cooked and beef was tough People were nice though Probably won t be back again unless I was with people that wanted to come here 
npnktZ6iUN9_f50P5zTnsw CMU There aren t many good Chinese cuisines in the Princeton area but this one is pretty good The customer service could be improved but the food is delicious Although I was disappointed in the dimsum a few of the dishes off the menu are great Definitely try the chinese soup dumplings or pork vermicelli casserole they re one of my favorites I would have given them 4 stars but after ordering a few times for delivery they stopped delivering to canal point also in Princeton because the driver was complaining I was pretty disappointed but still my go to place for good ol fashioned Chinese food 
nrbdetGw6SO9rlWZfCDP_g CMU With limited Asian food options in the Plainsboro area I was excited when my friends mentioned grabbing a quick lunch at a Chinese place nearby The meal started nicely with won ton chips and their special dipping sauce waiting for us at the table would go nicely with some beer and sunday night football I digress Their lunch specials are reasonably priced 9 with tax tip and their service is quick However our waitress was horrible I don t know if that was her indoor voice but I swear she was yelling at us while asking us what we wanted As I asked for the chow mein she told me that what I really wanted was another noodle dish I informed her politely that I wanted the chow mein and she had the audacity to tell me that that was NOT what I wanted Last I checked I was still half Chinese and I knew what chow mein was To add another note on our waitress typically you get the bill at the end of the meal We got the bill with fortune cookies a few minutes after we were served our meal The place wasn t even close to half way packed and our group felt like she wanted to get us out ASAP Anyway my dish was oily enough to deep fry some egg rolls if I ever had the need yes the noodles were more than edible but it just wasn t good Chinese at all However with limited options in the area I m likely to come back 
nRKBbvtqmghY8BJrmELFjg CMU An avoidable place especially if you have a tendency to get suckered in by the cheap lunch specials The fried rice is stale and the meat leaves you uneasy almost a little queasy 
nTAU3c_rVf7BE6yGdKNc1g CMU Average Chinese place Sign outside said vote for us as top 100 chinese in the area I would not put them at the top Maybe around 50 as they were only average For the lunch price I paid which was high I could have done better at the shore at a chinese take out place My food was good but not really impressed The paintings on the wall should not be American like they were but Chinese 
nxK-aqnUEAqj3C332_INWw CMU Made a reservation for 20 Got there and they made us wait nearly 1 2 hour at lunch Then brought us to a table for 15 Their excuse Well people often don t bring as many as they say they will WTF They finally grudgingly made room for about 17 and we crammed in Eventually an adjacent table emptied and when asked they added that space I d heard great things about PF Changs but frankly suspect that my Szechuan Shrimp was thawed from a pre prepped frozen block The much vaunted lettuce wraps are topped by another local non chain place All in all seems to be a triumph of marketing hype over expensive substance 
NyDIV_jqlyiChEHcRIi6xA CMU Went with group of 9 people Food was very good as usual however the service was fair at best Waitress appeared completely frustrated and let us know it One meal was forgotten but taken off the check Not sure if I would consider going with a larger group again on a Sat nite Appears too much for them to handle 
o1DgNIyQYX_QPUPR92jzQA CMU If I was just writing this review on my own experiences I would only give it 1 star but since DW seems to like it and they do try to cater to special diets and food allergies I ll bump them up to 2 The first time I went they asked if anybody has allergies dietary restrictions etc I told them I have a mushroom allergy Many of their dishes use an oyster mushroom sauce but their gluten free sauce does not have mushrooms so the manager said she would make me an eggplant dish with the gluten free sauce Not bad so I went back for lunch I asked my waiter if I could have the eggplant dish with the gluten free sauce and the a hole said absolutely not and I could only order off of the gluten free menu even though I don t have Celiac or a wheat allergy It also annoys me that I can t order the lettuce wraps which people love because they have mushrooms and I guess they just open up a can of lettuce wrap mix and heat it up Typical chain restaurant bs 
OBp2kzm09vA-74Z-y7QXpw CMU I m a fan because it s a great price I just go to the sushi bar the whole time and I really get my money s worth It s pretty good and their mushrooms are really good too but often overlooked Check the clipper magazine for coupons 
Od12CY8S0LRZDefOgtZmNQ CMU I would classify the food more on Asian Fusion side than on America Chinese as such staples as crab rangoon or sweet an sour chicken are conspicuously absent from the menu Instead you can have some delicious snow crab wontons and pineapple and mango breaded chicken breaded not batter fried Everything I tried there has been very good creeky chicken is a winner and the pricing is great Atmosphere is serene with lots of open space and tasteful decorations even the waiting area is comfortable and peaceful Overall this is our favorite Asian restaurant in the area 
OhoZc4fX87DUgeCcYyx1Tw CMU I really enjoyed Sunny Garden the first few times I went there but the last few times I thought service and the food slipped a bit Not sure I will rush back but probably will make it back at some point It is more of a 2 5 based on recent visits 
onUkqKXW0AnO7fXf8k3Fnw CMU 3 5 stars it s 4 stars in the context of princeton and the absence of good chinese food in general i only had chinese food there they also have some vietnamese and malaysian but i do not intend try those their chinese food was pretty good the egg rolls were tasty and crispy chow mein was flavorful and the portion was large i liked it that their sauces were not thick and syruppy but overall the food was nothing to write home about but it s better than the other chinese joints in princeton i was there when the place was really empty the dining area was surprisingly nice given that you have to walk past the cemetery on the way to the restaurant i will come back again when i need a relatively nice comfort food warm rice crispy vegetables and tasty meat hmmmmmm btw cash only 
OvV2xZkzfuvWaotm5Rol5g CMU I visited Sunny Garden for lunch and it was recommended that I go for the buffet but I wish I had just chosen a lunch entre The prices were great for both but the buffet didn t have much choice 4 options and they only had one tofu dish on the buffet so if you re vegetarian it s not for you Overall the food was good the prices were right the atmosphere was quiet and friendly and the service okay 
oxDuEMBWZm6cQOcqy9VKUQ CMU As the closest Chinese restaurant to our house this place immediately gets kudos for that Kidding well kinda Its close proximity to us means that my family members are frequent customers to this small Chinese restaurant tucked away in the corner of the ShopRite shopping center Which means that we ve become friendly with all the servers and the boss But thankfully we re quite the fans of the food This is the third restaurant or so opened by the boss He also owns the Tiger Noodles in downtown Princeton This place I find to be more authentic You can even get the Chinese only menu for the good stuff I recommend being able to read it first Some traditional favorites Niu rou mian Beef noodle soup traditional mainland China comfort food Kong xin cai Water spinach standard way of cooking always yum Three types of mushroom bok choy I forget the name of this dish Xiao long bao small pork buns they re not amazing here but there aren t that many places you can pick them up Well okay scratch that Shanghai Park only a couple miles away has better but since we go here more it s more convenient I m usually skeptical about the Chinese restaurants back East because California has all the new immigrants but this place knows how to get a reasonably priced pretty authentic Chinese meal on your table I d go back Oh wait we do Frequently Update Feb 08 Sorry Ya Ya It s really only your Beef Noodle Soup that I love The rest just doesn t do it for me Knocking you back a star 
OZYoMjT7KyBlS178Oe0O8w CMU Xiao Lung Bao soupy dumplings 5 stars Other food sweet and sour ribs rice cake etc 1 star Separate menus in English and Chinese 1 star I am surprised by the highly mediocre reviews for this location of Shanghai Park Of course I ve only been there once but I think it s a pretty decent Shanghainese place overall Their main attraction is the XLB soooo soupy with a nice tasty morsel of pork inside The skin could be a bit thinner and with a bit more chewiness but the soupiness makes up for it YUM My main gripe is that they are very confused with their approach come on sushi at a Shanghainese restaurant They also have separate menus in English and Chinese which I tend to really dislike It makes me feel like they re treating patrons differently I don t know if they offer different things in each menu but it makes me suspicious Off menu is one thing separate menu is another especially since it s not a hole in the wall type place I m glad I went with folks who could do the ordering in Chinese but I don t know if I d have the same experience on my own 
o_3UGIf2Bsq3ruH4boW28g CMU The place inside smelled funny If we didn t have the option of sitting outside I don t know if we would go back or make it thru a meal The food was cheap 6 7 for lunch My friend got perrier water and was only charged 1 more then a soda okay that amazed me I don t know why They take Credit cards only past 10 The food was good for the most part the rice could have been a lot better but the veggies were great and the food came out super fast I like food a little less oily so I didn t finish it all The hot and sour soup was pretty good The fried rice looked more like a side dish compared to the other lunch options and pretty standard not as good as joy yees or other places I ve seen for the speed 
P-Pt2nGDISrsxedSa1LB3Q CMU I found the secret to this buffet The time when it teems with Chinese customers and all the white folks look like they got lost and ended up in the restaurant by accident Weekend brunch lunch Where you fill up on your dim sum yum cha items for cheap With fresh shrimp dumplings har gow leek and shrimp dumplings sticky rice congee jook turnip cakes lo bok gow and xiao long bao you can get your fill easily I mean a plate of 4 little shrimp dumplings at most restaurants runs for 3 4 alone Toss in some pretty tasty hot items bamboo fish tofu and the likes and cleanse with fruit and dessert and you have a well rounded meal for 9 99 a head baby Yeah you know that s my Asian upbringing speaking 
P1pjAeI8OneSp9MMemhb_w CMU i ate there a couple times it s good and delicious it tastes like typical east coast chinese food i really miss chinese food back in cailifornia but it is what it is it s nice it could have been three stars but minus one star for the heavy use of msg one time i got really dizzy after a meal there and i don t think it was psychological other people felt that too so last time i ate there i was little prepared mentally i said to myself hmmm ok after the meal i might feel little dizzy but the food is delicious so you have to live with it but i found ivy garden same kind of food not as much msg so i know where i ll go next oh and they only take cash which can be a hassle 
p58NUsnYblDVByFHpdf8kQ CMU Good Chinese food from a chain establishment The best lo mein I ve had anywhere 
p7gGJlXcI_F5XxuYMeo25g CMU In terms of how the food is made I preferred the US Route 1 location which is now permanently closed They had some of the same dishes but they cooked it differently and I liked how the closed location prepared them i e the Pork with Bean Curd Pickle At the US Route 1 location they made it with just these three ingredients in a clean sauce less way The pork was also shredded very thin and they gave you a lot more of it At the Princeton location they were skimpy with the pork the dish was swimming in sauce and they used a lot of celery as filler What I like most about this location is the option of dining outside On a nice day it s really relaxing to enjoy the weather while eating their delicious scallion pancakes which I highly recommend The service is fast and efficient After your lunch or dinner you can walk it off by strolling through scenic Princeton and then enjoy some ice cream at Thomas Sweets NOTE They also have bubble tea here Not my favorite place to have it but it will do 
pBHQxqaVmpKJJBn4Dwq2wQ CMU On behalf of all white people I am insulted by Shanghai Park I have been about 4 times before tonight As a Chinese American and a particularly picky eater I found this place to be previously pretty good for Princeton when I went with other Chinese Americans Tonight I went with 4 friends who happen to be white and the food was horrendous I ordered using a mix of Chinese and English and what came out was undercooked vegetables with oil or sugary sauce poured on top meat dishes with shreds of this and that but mainly hot peppers also barely cooked and worse a deep batter fried shrimp thing with a mayonnaise side sauce that I don t think ever had ANYTHING to do with Chinese food It was like a really bad fish and chip that cost 17 I have eaten this shrimp dish for 29 years of my life in Cantonese Hup To Ha and can t BELIEVE this is how they interpret it for white folk I think if you order off the Chinese menu and are Chinese you can avoid this OVERT RACISM I m insulted for white people and I m insulted as a CHINESE that the people here don t take more pride in their cuisine as a representation of their culture I was thinking I would take my parents here for graduation but honestly even if they fancy it up because they are Chinese I m so bloody insulted by how they treated my white friends that I am convinced they don t deserve my patronage or frankly yours 
pHtZISBhnFbcVT8r70xHlg CMU I went to this PF Changs on March 21st 2009 Firstly the resturant was full and buzzing We checked in at reception and was told there is a 1 40 wait but it could be as quick as 1 hour We waited waited waited for 2 15 hrs Finally when we was a bit rude to the young kid actually two of them running around he went to his boss and said something and we finally got a table These people at the reception were whispering to each other as if they are hiding something It looks very bad in front of the customer The manager never came and apologized The food was good The waiter Joe was good Bottom line reception folks are complete idiots and have no clue how to seat people Folks coming after us got tables in 30 mins If I ever go back I will call ahead If you do please please make reservations 
poTTIC3zMQl-rfVesWAtkA CMU Cheap But taste Bad 
pPiweeq9Jq0ieGGp3yOpfw CMU This place closed due to the fire on 7 31 09 
PqMZ_1H-KMG_X-y-n5U0eg CMU Standard American Chinese fare Good for take out There are better Chinese restaurants in Princeton but I ve never had a disaster here either 
pSY78dDkvg2jmEWGBKb5sQ CMU Good place to grab some Chinese food for lunch for a reasonable price The lunch menu is extensive and includes your typical lunch special fare Not as greasy as normal takeout food but flavors are about the same 
py9_PiAAfH-Xuj0YDOqizg CMU Hate to hate this place The food here was cold old and dried the last time I was here I think it was because it was on a Monday night there were not that many customers so the kitchen did not want to bring out new fresh food On a weekend this place can be better Due to more customers and higher turn over of the food They have huge selections of regular Chinese dishes such as general Tso s chicken vegetable low mein etc and as well as sushi crab legs dim sums etc If they can only improve their food freshness and quality on a weekday I don t think I would return again 
P_tcHS62FJn7opdBQ3T8zg CMU Sunny Garden is an excellent upscale Chinese Japanese restaurant located on Rt 1 near Princeton NJ Like Janelle R said in her review the food is consistently excellent The best item on the menu has to be the Creaky Chicken 13 00 which consists of shallow fried white meat chicken in a brown ginger sauce It s a little spicy and a little sweet It s wonderful The sushi at Sunny Garden however isn t that wonderful I mean it s ok but compared to other local sushi places like Shogun 27 or Banzai well it s just not as good Janelle was also dead on when she talked about the service on weekends Wow It can be pretty bad I remember one time when we practically begged someone to take our money then 20 minutes later begged them to give us our change During the week however the service is much better as the restaurant is much less crowded But if reasonable prices and great food are what you re after take a trip to Sunny Garden 
q3iK3gj1WbOUDWwOb4-epQ CMU Small little simple restaurant with good food I liked this place 
QCF1VY1EEoo8Go6ZqU0Thw CMU P F Chang s Chinese Bistro in Princeton NJ is part of a chain of restaurants across the United States and as far as chain restaurants go this place is pretty good When I first went to P F Chang s Chinese Bistro I wasn t all that impressed but things have since gotten much better with the addition of the Flavors of Yunnan portion of the menu Man this stuff is good Let s look at a few examples Dali Chicken the tender pieces of boneless skinless chicken breast and firm crisp Yukon Gold Potatoes tossed in chili sauce is a hearty dish with a spicy kick The chili sauce evenly coats the chicken potatoes and green leeks giving the dish a rich red color Zodiac Noodles my personal favorite A savory blend of vegetables noodles and two types of pork lean strips and cured Serrano Ham Tossed with a blend of Kung Pao and Abalone sauces this dish has a rich almost buttery feel Yunnan Wontons Crispy Wontons filled with flavorful Serrano Ham soft cheese ginger and green onion served with a Chinese Honey Mustard The Yunnan Wontons are a perfect balance of salt from the ham and sweetness from the honey with a distinct kick from the mustard All quotes from the official P F Chang s Chinese Bistro at http www pfchangs com cuisine yunnan_menu jsp The side dishes are also quite good especially the Garlic Soy Cucumbers and the Garlic Snap Peas Service is either excellent or awful recently it s been awful Also P F Chang s Chinese Bistro can get pretty darned crowded so plan accordingly 
QHpCWLK6Awe0MSpuLB5VNw CMU this place is alright when it comes to Chinese food in the central Jersey area The food is americanized a little bit but still close enough to be the real deal even to the Chinese crowd self included But I ll say its a bit overpriced but that s typical of any restaurants close to Princeton 
QL8SjuMx48pQ8qTU0B86HQ CMU The food is very good after waiting 40 minutes The service was brutal but all in all I would definitely come back 
QMTACbRRFbDR3Ry2Hw_rJg CMU Quickie update We needed some quick PTSD therapy see other chinese buffet reviews By comparison the buffet is really terrific selection stir fried string beans beef chow fun steamed tofu spicy fried calamari shrimp with edemame hoisin eggplant Supplemented by dim sum items har gow shrimp dumpling shu mai chive dumplings sia long boa Yum time for the gym Cheers 
qOvPR-FZDr9vn024ckrRBw CMU CLOSED WINTER 2010 THIS IS NOW AN INDIAN RESTAURANT I had high hopes for this place as my husband has had lunch there a few times and said it was pretty good and I m getting sick of my own less than spectacular reviews 6 30 Sunday night Not too busy We had to wait a few minutes before the one server came out to seat us Water and tea quickly arrived and refilled regularly without requests The couple in front of us received their curried chicken which smelled amazing and reminded me of St Lucian chicken roti Ooh 5 spice crispy duck Let s get that Egg drop soup sweet and sour soup honey roasted pork appetizer 5 spice crispy duck While enjoying the tea and more tea we waited about 10 minutes before the soups showed up They each were accompanied by a package of saltines that was a first The pork appetizer arrived immediately afterwards Egg Drop Soup Bright bright yellow the colour of egg yolks I don t think I ever before saw a dish glowing with that colour Decent flavour particularly with lots of white pepper Hot Sour Soup tasted faintly of grapefruit rinds boiled as tea Pork slightly overcooked in a sticky overly sweet sauce While waiting another 10 minutes and noticing that the couple who arrived and ordered after us already received their dinner the people behind us were debating whether styrofoam was really that much worse than waxed paper cups dude styrofoam doesn t ever degrade paper and wax do We started dipping the saltines into the chili oil better than at most places while perusing the zodiac again Ah Food The duck was served plain on a bed of lettuce Jim said it tasted like chicken I thought it was both overcooked and really greasy while lacking any of the 5 spices it was named after At this point we really didn t care as we were so hungry and tempted to eat the soles of our shoes The fortune cookie was brought out quickly and was perfect light delicate vanilla scented and with a happy fortune Dinner for 2 including tax and tip 30 Unfortunately my favourite parts of the meal were the tea and fortune cookie The server was really nice but the food was a disappointment I m giving the place a 2 because the chicken curry smelled like chicken roti which was my favourite meal in the Caribbean People thought this was Useful 1 Funny 1 Cool 1 Edit Remove Send to a Friend Link to This Review Write an Update 
QQnInIVauQY1ITAOvvTWYw CMU Tiger is a nice compromise between quality and price especially if you re looking for a quick noodle fix The noodle soups are a better choice the stir fried versions such as Singapore Rice Noodles typically are too greasy for my taste The staff is friendly and pleasant and they remember their customers It s a place where you can say give me my usually and they know what it is Note no credit cards and it s a two block walk to the nearest ATM 
qSY40kdDbOnmidne_xrIPA CMU Another place for students and not foodies like us Since the change of management 2 or 3 years ago their future doesn t look so bright Actually we just went there today for lunch and all three of us were disappointed First of all there was a greasy musty smell and it was very stuffy so we had to ask the waitress to turn up the AC After that we ordered I got my wonton soup first and saw that there was a good amount of extra oil in there I didn t have the broth after seeing that Dad got General Tso s his absolute fave Chinese dish and was very distressed to see that the batter part of the chicken was very thick and there wasn t enough meat inside Mom got shrimp fried rice and was also pretty crestfallen to see that there was a layer of oil sitting on top of the rice Me I got chicken and black bean sauce which so far every Chinese restaurant has been able to make the right way Almost every Chinese restaurant that is I don t know what the chef was thinking but the whole sauce seemed to come from a bottle of soy sauce except for the black beans No wonder there was a whole crowd at Tiger Noodles and we were the only people at Ivy Garden Don t waste your money people Go to Tiger Noodles where you can get some value for your money and come home with a full satisfied stomach Isha Biswas age 11 
Q_To6UT8zVL9nYyiAvPMrA CMU I ve been here many times over the past decade Nothing particularly fancy but a solid enough local place The food is always nice and hot and the ingredients as other reviewers have noted taste fresh My comment would be that the menu is rather limited and while I often feel a limited menu helps to focus restaurants it seems a bit narrower than most Chinese places in the area Secondly at our last visit and I don t know if this really means anything we ordered regular pork and vegetable pan fried dumplings and they had quite a bit of cinnamon on the outside I don t know if this is a regional thing but it seemed somewhat unusual to me That said the chow fun and pork with garlic sauce were both excellent 
R1gPjewJHIctfANHCuhbbw CMU Back in the day when this place was called the Great Wall it was just a hole in the wall so to speak When we came back recently we found it to be transformed into a pretty nice restaurant we actually had our rehearsal dinner here suck on that Lahiere s If only it were here when I was a student Anyways they have a very good xiao long bao for the money I think it s better than Joe s Shanghai only been to the midtown location in NYC The XLB were always steaming hot and full of tasty broth The XLB were slightly on the large size and the wrapper was a little thicker than those down US1 at Grand Shanghai but the XLB were pretty good nonetheless Who would have thought that there would be two places to get pretty good XLB near Princeton Oh yeah their lion s head meatballs and stir fried pea sprouts are pretty good examples of Shanghai cuisine as well For those expecting standard beef with broccoli fried rice etc keep in mind that Shanghai cuisine specializes in sweet red sauces with soy sauce and sugar Examples of this would be the aforementioned meatballs pea sprouts and braised pork shoulder which may be too fatty for some people 
R3rLUkkwHsnCObH6NI6iOA CMU If you have no where else to go for lunch this would not be bad You can get an all you can eat buffet for 9 just not sure how much of it you would eat I have been there once with some co workers and i just had noodles and the sushi they have as part of the buffet Nothing there is fantastic or fresh but hey thats this area for you 
reFcd6H2Al6o1dPBnxXW8Q CMU Came here for a meal because I had a buy one entree get one free coupon We got the kung pao chicken and shanghai bok choy with shitake mushrooms The dishes were well seasoned and the bok choy sauce was flavorful without being greasy The kung pao chicken was okay but not as good as the vegetable Service wasn t very attentive even though there were only four people in the restaurant It came to about 15 total for the entrees including tax and 20 tip Not bad for lunch 
RHOmfXo5WI4v2FNlt62qZA CMU Service was outstanding Hot Sour soup and Wonton Soup both very good and egg rolls freshly prepared with crispy but not too greasy wrappers Sauteed asparagus in brown sauce with chicken was very flavorful but I d switch to broccoli next time as the asparagus was tough and woody Chicken Fried Rice was top notch No liquor license here though so make sure to BYOB Did I mention the service was outstanding It deserves two mentions the wait staff was phenomenal 
rLLLNPOX9wllSg6EHpKlwg CMU We finally stopped in to try the lunch specials and the change in service quality was quite discernible The vegetarian lettuce wrap app was good and arrived in less than 10 minutes after ordering and our water was consistently refilled without any prompting My moo goo gai pan was filled with shrimp and came with a very very generous portion of brown rice Taste wise it was flavorful and light and on par with the same dish at any of the other branches There was a generous portion of fresh crispy green snow peas that I really appreciated The orange peel chicken was okay and the portion of meat was very hearty for a lunch bowl the flavor was light and the thin batter was perfect since most places tend to use too much batter which leads to a KFC esque dish The chicken itself was just slightly dry but just very slightly The shrimp with candied walnuts had a nice mayo based slightly sweet sauce and the melon was a nice touch as before though some of the shrimp pieces were a bit overcooked This is better than the overly fried dish at most takeout places though Our server was very attentive and even offered to split the check for us which I had never encountered before and was impressed by The prices for the lunch specials are great most were under 10 and the portions were definitely filling Plus they all came with a soup or salad Not bad at all Hopefully they will keep up with the great work since we are already planning our next expedition here before trekking to the Garden theater to see the Dark Knight Rises Just be aware that this is a chain so there are no authentic Chinese dishes to be found 
Rmss9SUTxE8k-adjTk_IMg CMU I find this restaurant to be tons of fun brightly colored food a lively atmosphere yummy beverages and a friendly staff Everything I ve tried has been delicious and I m a HUGE fan of the sushi Really good quality sushi and imaginative and again fun choices YAY for YA YA 
rNw1RDD66Dw4XDp2o5a5Qg CMU Not bad Fast lunch service reasonable prices and they serve fried crispy things with every meal How can you go wrong with free fried crispy things and that orange sauce stuff 
RRSf2KhstQSRzZgJSfxg1A CMU The chicken lo mein is actually semi decent and not overly salty or greasy Go for the lunch specials Under 7 and comes with a spring roll or soup Portions are pretty good especially if you get a noodle dish Brown rice is 50 extra 
rSz1hcoIvvCbfLbLgouGnQ CMU Service was very nice tonight and they gave us 3 extra bowls of rice at no charge along with tea The waitress was very attentive and my chicken with garlic sauce was fairly good although I wasn t a huge fan of the shrimp with black bean sauce It was a bit too tangy The creaky chicken was pretty good and a nice alternative to General Tso s Prices are about the same as at the Nassau St location with a better atmosphere and service About 50 for 3 entrees and an appetizer with 6 bowls of rice and tea including tax and tip Not horrible for Princeton 
r_0kR7yXWp7D5m2n9Y61Vg CMU Do you want to do something cruel to your child one day When they grow up and decide to go on a 30 day health kick low calories low carbs no alcohol and specify that our lunch should only be composed of a protein and greens take them to Super Star East Buffet Mom Jenny we want to take you to this restaurant for lunch they definitely have lots of proteins and greens Mean mom mean So I can only comment on the insides of steamed dumplings which is pretty much the only thing I felt OK about eating It is quite sad to see a growing pile of dumpling wrappers accumulate on one s plate The insides were um fine They probably would ve tasted quite good wholly consumed Perusing the two stations of food I saw mac n cheese vegetable lo mein my two year old niece lurved fried tofu with green beans general tso s chicken satay bbq ribs porridge and the list goes on and on They also have a mongolian bbq station but no one seemed to be using it Mom got my niece a soft serve ice cream cone jello red pink and white wait get the white jello away it s made from almonds and I don t want to use the Epipen on her and a cookie Bad grandma bad The diners included families of all races Buffets unity 
s3wzZy1DQxebzoz9xY4ZcQ CMU This place is a family favorite bc we are all a bunch of lil Asian ppl who eat 3x s our body weight My parents are all about getting the most for their money so NATURALLY they will find their Super Star East coupons and take us there to stuff our faces It s true the cost per person def comes out cheaper than eating out at other restaurants bc you get to eat SO MUCH for less than 20 The new thing is that they serve dim sum during lunch on wkds haven t eaten here during the wk which is cool since there aren t too many dim sum choices in this area and sometimes you just don t want to drive the 20 30 min into N Brunswick Edison All your typical Chinese buffet dishes are available there s also sushi and a Mongolian bar aka pick what you want and they will cook it for you I haven t been there for dinner recently but they usually had snow crab legs daily and peking duck on wkds I was also surprised that they had the sweet tofu dessert and quite a bit of jello and cakes but I ll stick with the soft serve machine and fried doughnuts mmm I have heard things about the East location in Long Island and it doesn t sounds like this compares apparently they serve lobster Put that on my list of need to try 
SdocbU6k1rHrK8QEHqiCiQ CMU Hot Woke Cafe is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the Princeton area I ve been going there for years with my family and we re always welcomed like we are a part of Hot Wok s family The food is consistently good with ample portions and has a taste of authenticity when you steer away from the Americanized dishes For a restaurant out in the suburbs far from fresh fish mongers or farmers markets they do well 
ShbjqNGITJOXOF90MfOwGA CMU I ve give them a higher review if I could actually get in this place 40 minute wait on a Friday and plenty of people hanging around the bar I ve never had a table here only eaten at the bar I like the decor service food is faux Asian but good However who is going to wait 40 minutes for a table this time at night And there were plenty of empty tables looking around the place Beware the parking lot the clientele can t drive for shit 
sjXK8CDg-GQEz0lLnjuDwg CMU Great Chinese food My family has been going to this restaurant almost since they started Being vegetarian I usually have a limited choice and most Chinese restaurants do not understand that eggs or fish is not vegetarian Hot wok is really good and once they realized that I was vegetarian they warned me of dishes that would not work and even let me create my own dishes Try the shredded bean curd without the pork but with broccoli and spicy green chillies The owners John and Sara and most of the wait staff are very friendly and welcoming My luck the restaurant is also half a mile from home Heaven 
SMDjzermAXyOOsDktOLlFw CMU I have been here a few times prior to this year and I would HATE eating here If I had reviewed this before I would of gave it 1 star I ve lived here in the Princeton area all my life and there s not many good real Chinese restaurant All of them are cater to the non Asian They taste like Panda Express or recently PF Chang If I wanted good Chinese food I would go to NY Chinatown PA Chinatown or New Brunswick area I don t understand why there s so many people at PF Chang It s not really Chinese food And there s nobody that works there is Chinese The owner or chef must of changed because to my surprise recently the food actually taste good I m not sure why it s call Shanghai Park the food taste more like Cantonese food which is fine with me because I actually prefer Cantonese food I ve read other reviews here about the service is bad but I had not experienced that problem And if it was bad I would not be surprise at all in any Chinese Restaurant I don t really think that Chinese Restaurant stress or worry about service to their waiter waitress I ve been to a lot of please with bad services It s the way it is I go in expecting bad service in Chinese Restaurant even India Restaurant I think it s in the culture I recently been to a DC Chinatown the place was pack A line out the door Service was really bad Food was okay However I ve been to Shanghai China and the servers there where great Seem like there s a waitress standing at your table servicing you Go figure I think it s because it s in the big city and I only visit big Restaurant 
snzYwO96qxIsZPK2yqewqQ CMU Surly service always and mediocre food very limited seating indoors still limited seating outdoors 2 picnic style tables for 6 4 same for 4 people Bit far out of the way being far east down Rt 27 Nassau Not a fan but it suffices hunger so I return annually 
SoEr2BF4ocvT8JskGLXFVA CMU I m living NY but I have been here couple times with my friends Here is so comfortable the service is so nice the food is very very fresh and delicious I definitely come back again and again I will 
soGgrH7rnnG4fVhZ95VvXw CMU the mongolian beef reminds me of homecooking so much 
sR0SUCajW_bVIdEaZR-V5g CMU The teriyaki chicken is the best thing there Everything else is so so 
SRGiZ0zk_6QF5ZDGd0uxVA CMU Compared with other local Chinese food restaurants this is one of the better ones The prices are a little expensive for dinner but they have a reasonable lunch menu Their crispy chicken sesame is lovely and sweet and they make an excellent chicken shrimp dish though it s a little greasy There are plenty of healthy options on the menu and the vegetable are always super fresh Their dumplings are different and thinner than typical freezer to frier dumplings but the egg rolls are same old same old 
Sv9W_-BYiRNROoxMw-izJQ CMU If you must go go only for their dinner dishes Absolutely do not consider Shanghai Park for your weekend dimsum jaunt even if it is the only place that serves dimsum in the Princeton area You will be spectacularly disappointed The menu claims that the dimsum are cooked fresh to order yet when we added an extra plate of har gow to our order it arrived at the table less than 30 sec later My friends and I shared a look of Their siu mai was probably the worst offender of them all they tasted no better than my microwaved frozen ajinimoto shrimp siu mai filled with some ambiguous filling that is neither here nor there The only dishes I look forward to here are their shengjian or xiaolong bao and that s usually because of severe deprivation Moreover their food isn t cheap we came away from lunch for 11 person but I made myself two bowls of oatmeal later that afternoon to stave off hunger pangs Dinner options fare better and I ve actually come away from Shanghai Park feeling somewhat satisfied before But by better I mean relative to the other pathetic Chinese restaurants in Princeton Ivy Tiger Noodles Karen s come to mind Even so amongst my friends Hunan is quickly gaining ground on Shanghai Park as it is a much cheaper alternative and cheap in many cases equals good or at least for college students Oh and last thing I doubt I need to tell you this as you re on yelp and should know a good thing or two about food but never order sushi at a Chinese restaurant It s just not a good idea 
SWWj9MmH36-ceudQ7V1pGg CMU Love pf chang Friendly and efficent staff great food they had to find a mananger to use my Yelp coupon though 
szWvnQYFoF5nD3FtNs8g9w CMU Love the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Spicy Chicken They often have long waits but given the awful Chinese restaurants in the area I find myself here often 
T8TJyf-iWXutqKYAdCYPUQ CMU the food here is actually quite good i never had any bad dishes here their xiao long boa was nice they also have real chinese food in the chinese menu i used my limited knowledge of chinese to decode some of that and ordered really good dishes nothing mind blowing though but it s probably the best chinese food in princeton 
TEyLKPU-_y5eibxXm0xJnw CMU Pretty crazy the wait here is bizarre I tried going here a few times and the wait was always over an hour with people literally lined up outside waiting to get in I waited one night and we finally got in and grabbed a couple drinks that were okay We had an appetizer of chicken lettuce wraps that were good followed by an entree of Mongolian beef The food wasn t bad it was just incredibly salty I was throwing back water like I found an oasis in the desert Overall the restaurant was extremely loud salty but not super pricey I d prefer to support local Asian restaurants in the future 
tOjsampRrv6BDtlDqn8maA CMU Pros Food is delicious Flat out delicious We have eaten here at least twice and on both occasions all of the dishes have been well cooked They also have a large menu which accommodates those who want mild no MSG vegetarian etc The desert is also good most Chinese food desserts aren t sweet Plenty of seating and only a small wait Cons Loud atmosphere since there are usually a lot of people there Sitting outside is a risk since we unfortunately had a spider fall on our table from a lamp above They definitely need to clean The food is a bit on the expensive side especially since most of the dishes can be bough for 1 2 the price at other Chinese food stores What we ordered They have a 2 for 40 deal which we purchased I believe this is the best way to spend money there We have had the lettuce wraps which comes with a large portion plenty for two people Crispy Honey Chicken and Chang s Spicy Chicken both of which were good and my gf and I each took some home since we had too much food Triple Chocolate Mousse Mini for dessert also epic Overall One of the better places to go out to eat If given the option you should absolutely take the opportunity to try it out Just be aware that it is expensive though you will have leftovers 
tOTWhrFzoS2FczzKUZJQpw CMU Modern decor mixed with higher end Chinese take out PF Changs The presentation of the food was really nice However it tastes just like take out ok maybe better They earn their stars with the service The wait staff was very efficient and never left my cup empty They wraps are always a nice light choice 
tRs-NZd1KCPTT44kybbpKw CMU My daughter was at a surprise sleep over and we went on 6 23 08 We got there at 7pm on a Monday and surprise they had a 25 minute wait for two Why they don t expand I ll never know They have an outside seating area it was a beautiful night but that wait must be off the hook Found 2 seats at the bar Had the Chicken Lettuce Wrap appetizer so good and I had the Grilled Citrus Soy Salmon over brown rice My wife had the Wok Charred Beef Both entrees were great Service at the bar was flawless and attentive Dinner was pricey because I thought it would be weird to order a bottle of wine while sitting at the bar So my wife and I had 2 glasses each my Iron Horse Pinot Noir was 14 a glass Oh well We had the bonus of sitting next to Dan Cangemi a Hollywood Special Effects guy He s in town because they are filming Transformers II in Princeton He was a really nice guy with a cool job Check his film work on Google 
tV8ZrrR8yxHQQ9UWAuaAYQ CMU Been here half a dozen times both for lunch and dinner I love their pot stickers and chicken lettuce wrap The place is nicely decorated The young wait staff are usually very friendly This place can get really busy and loud though so if you want a quiet dinner this is not your place 
TVbA6q7qgofHf_CZgnHm7w CMU The best Chinese restaurant within 20 minutes of Princeton Ingredients taste fresh and not greasy Lunch specials are a good deal 
tvBZhGHFfrkRNZqCWj-Rag CMU Strictly on Take outs I visited this place often for take out when I went grocery shopping to whole food I almost always got General Tso s chicken with egg drop soup I thought the food was fairly tasty One of the better options for chinese take outs in Princeton Area 
twJ9aAM3uVw9-8ZqKoM3iQ CMU Outstanding sushi John is amazing 
tWxN59B97-_A4vl00gAA_Q CMU 5 stars for having good authentic and inexpensive Chinese food in the Princeton University area If I ever want Chinese food I ll go to Hunan if it s open Well worth the walk 
t_Q9cxAdSdbUuoSXhGbiqA CMU My mom loves this place Every time I come home for a visit she says Have I ever taken you to Shanghai Park in Princeton Yes mom we went last time I was home and sure we can go again This is a Shanghainese restaurant The cuisine is close to Cantonese in that it s mild not spicy slightly sweet but it s not Cantonese I liked the variety of dishes that I normally don t see On the weekends they have dim sum They have a nice variety of small portion dishes so we got to try a lot I really enjoyed the drier bao with meat inside it wasn t xiao long bao and the scallion pancake Stay away from ordering stir fried veggies I think they prepared it well and offered some nice variety in preparations you can choose from several such as fermented tofu or garlic but for 12 95 it s a huge ripoff These same veggies in an Asian market would cost 2 bucks So we ll stick with meat and carbs for the next time 
uaZRW9M4d5LOv6pfSJZEMQ CMU I don t think there are many good chinese restaurants in my area My husband and I tried Tiger Noodle one evening and were pleasantly surprised I ve been on weight watchers and found the steamed chicken and veggies were pretty tasty It did get cold really quick My husband had sesame chicken which was amazing but not weight watchers friendly Oh well The staff seemed very friendly So far it s our go to Chinese place 
ucmzfVMNoIm5TV3pjXp0Kw CMU Finding the best Chinese food in the NJ burbs is tantamount to hunting for the tallest chihuahua This place wins by a millimeter It is actually better than that For a suburban restaurant Hot Wok is really quite good God only knows we need decent ethnic food in this part of the world Please visit this place so it can stay in business Otherwise we will be relegated to eating at the other Chinese restaurants which seem to serve canned La Choy re heated in the microwave 
uDjqr4JBH2qfMB7JEW0ENw CMU As if you couldn t tell from the name this place specializes in Shanghai cuisine I recommend you stick to it Seriously this place shines in its traditional Shanghai dishes other Chinese dishes pale in comparison The restaurant itself tries to be a bit upscale in the rather ghetto Princeton Shopping Center We used to go to this restaurant before it changed owners twice from Lee s Castle to King s Castle to its new invention of Shanghai Park In the process it was recently redone several years ago to cater to the upscale Princeton crowds and to some extent it succeeded But I think business still isn t hot per se The best group I ve ever seen here though was a table of young American girls getting Mandarin lessons from an old Chinese guy Man talk about overambitious mothers trying to get their kids ahead in the world order Service is always genial Our family also frequents this place rather often so most of them recognize us by now Some favorite dishes Xiao long bao small pork buns Juicy steaming deliciousness For the area an A compared to others maybe a B Silk melon or Luffa with gluten si gua chao mian jing Okay the English name sounds ridiculous I ll admit But this dish is a staple for us The gluten looks kind of like the hard tofu with the brown outside but is soft and fluffy inside And the melon is nice and soft as well but not mushy Fresh sauteed crab Traditional Chinese sauteed crab Yum Steamed sea bass They steam this perfectly and the accompanying sauce is nice and light Not too oily They also have dim sum here on the weekends Nothing stellar but not bad since it s one of the few places in the general vicinity where you can find some They don t do the cart service but you can order specifics I ll stick to their xiao long bao and their seafood dimsum Cantonese food isn t their specialty per se Overall good stuff Just make sure to stick with the Shanghainese dishes A little pricey to be sure But they get away with it by keeping a Princeton mailing address and catering to Princeton s suburbs Still a good Chinese meal in my book Edit Okay we ve been enjoying this place more than Ya ya Noodles down 206 As I said as long as you stick to the Shanghai dishes you re good to go It does tend to trend on the pricier side though Stupid Princeton prices But dagnabbit stop segregating the Chinese and the Americans Why is that we always get sat in the back section It better be because we re closer to the wait service shakes fist 
UHFzbhn5R7ec_Y70CB9iDA CMU Excellent food and great service Atmosphere is a little loud 
uKKvJpHSMgYjj8y3yYOLDQ CMU This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Mercer County Any dish you order will contain fresh ingredients and have a clean taste compared to most Chinese restaurants where the food seems premade and be over sauced I love their Kung Pao Chicken and my wife loves the Crispy Shrimp and Walnuts and we both always share the pan fried dumplings 
uLo_hraPfDvRvfXpP_bjaA CMU The worst experience I ever had The boss was very rude when I asked why our dishes took so long and he acted like an asshole 
uLXnrE7sKArSAwF-KtgeUQ CMU While I m glad they were open on Christmas day and given that I was looking forward to it because we ve eaten there before and enjoyed it we were disappointed with the quality of the food this time Services was quick Our waitress had some trouble understanding us our Chinese is a lot worse but the order was delivered correctly Too oily was the major problem and the fried rice while having a fair amount of shrimp was lacking in other flavors and items The chicken in lettuce wrap was just cooked chopped chicken laid out on a piece of lettuce Boring 
uQhTbLE7f9hA4vjohZFl-g CMU Love it It s an American Chinese restaurant with a Texas feel Yee haw The buffet is large and appears clean Food is re stocked regularly and the selection is excellent There s sushi and a Mongolian BBQ in the back and a large array of American food for you weeners out there And yes they have crab legs which you ll see the minute you walk in the door because seemingly everyone who goes there eats a three foot stack of them I find the weekend price to be excessive something like 16 95 per person but the weekday price is significantly cheaper and the food is the same 
ur0bJ6aDBoxmqjoOWhd_zw CMU Food is literally just OK If it s any worse I would not visit Sliced fish in hot chili oil is a house special dish and it tastes decent very Americanized Chinese food Fish was obviously frozen and they put a bit too much starch in the dish Sauteed string beans is what I usually get cannot go wrong with it Today we also had eggplant in sizzling hotpot and that was the highlight of the meal flavorful and soft in texture but still there is too much starch Come here if you actually cannot find any better alternatives 
uZ0XnU32ZaXr1vfFnBI3oQ CMU The best Chinese food I ve ever tasted Fresh ingredients warm and welcoming people clean and reliable Without fail it is always a good meal 
UznWY6XPsq67qLtNAQh18g CMU This place used to be cheap and just decent enough to endure with the exception of 2 nice people the pretty rude staff Alas not anymore The extremely Americanized food is now even worse than before if possible All you taste is oil If I wanted to pay 9 15 to eat oil I could just buy a crate of heart clogging potato chips and would still have a more satisfying meal They also increased their prices while noticeably reducing portions I know times are tougher nowadays but seriously one of their better noodle soups is now nothing but a big bowl of oily brown colored water with a few sad grey pieces of meat floating in there it made me think of dog food first time a meal made me think of dog food and a small stuck together clump of noodles sitting at the bottom of the brown water It was unbelievable The brusque staff and service are a joke Two of three times we ve ordered delivery from them in the past year we ve gotten either a lukewarm soggy package over an hour later or absolutely nothing over an hour later Mind you they claim they can deliver within Princeton in 40 minutes Multiple calls long after the food is supposed to turn up will get you nowhere they just start arguing with you on the phone as if it was your fault they can t do their job fulfill a simple delivery order But we ve learned our lesson never will we bother to pay hard earned money for horrible Asian food unbelievably meager portions and the mispleasure of being yelled at by staff who can t do their jobs 
v1-HcvGgcsoWQrD6DfmVQg CMU The pho I got here was terrible 
v99qjwErfNahJQ88-NSyWQ CMU Went in for lunch on a weekday Note cash only Portions were just the right size and came out piping hot and very fresh Best Chinese cuisine I have had since moving to central NJ from NYC 
vAkYnsxF32lyLn_4uUyulg CMU I wish there was an option for no star I experienced severe food poisoning as a result of eating at Ming s Court The service was horrible the options very limited and the food obviously very bad During all the peak restaurant hours the place is close to empty Save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else 
-7eG2WInjLQPfSEBmwqiJA CMU Horrible got food poisoning GI upset a few hours after the meal so I can naturally only think to blame this place Also we were seated next to a crying baby and when we asked to be re seated we were seated right next to the cash register waiters bump in to you 
-bflVORq8NKbwKLk0gpStA CMU Mary Chung seems to be a solid choice for Chinese food when you re out and about in Central It s nothing extraordinarily stellar to write home about but it s reasonably priced centrally located and extremely edible I came here with some friends around 6 on a Friday night before heading to MIT to see a play and we were able to be seated right away The service was decent again nothing stellar but nothing to really complain about We had the Hot Platter for an appetizer which is really just an assortment of friend things It was nice to nosh on but I ll admit I m not enamored of fried foo as a rule I had the Moo Shi Vegetable which was definitely served with ample plum sauce and plenty of pancakes And while it was tasty I did find myself wishing I d ordered it with some meat In the past I d had their General Gau s chicken and it s definitely yummy So maybe I ll go back to that next time Word of warning Their spicy noodles I think it s the dun dun noodles are veeeeeeeery spicy So be prepared Oh and they re cash only which is good to know before walking in Overall if I lived closer I d definitely order from them more often and if I m in the area I may choose this place but for now it s gonna stick on the list of places that are possibilities and will not likely be making a pilgrimage to Central just for this place 
-BiUUCcXRX_Ktp2kdlm2xA CMU This has always been one of our favorites in the Boston area Not the usual style dim sum that most folks are accustomed to but a more savory Northern Chinese style cuisine Eating here has always left us satisfied 
-bPIneXmxPkK2iO_4feyfQ CMU I still can t figure out why this place is called Thailand Cafe when it has such great Chinese food Whenever my friends visit me in Cambridge I take them here to give them a taste of real spicy Sichuan food They don t have a very big selection the only downside to me but of the ones they have all of them are very well prepared Service can be a little slow but the ladies are very helpful Once I had a dish that was too salty and they offered me a free new dish 
-C3MyZBUSR75wKE8RIkGAQ CMU Oh the yuckiness of this place where to begin Since it s a shabu shabu joint let s start with the broth Our large ish group ordered 3 different broths all of which looked suspiciously the same like cloudy dishwater The overwhelming flavor of each was salt I think they dissolved some bouillon cubes in some hot water and served them as miso regular and a third variety that I m blanking on at the moment perhaps because the memorable flavor was salt That ought to be enough to put you off this place But in case you still think Shabu Square might have some redeeming qualities that could merit checking it out in person please allow me to further disabuse you of that sadly mistaken idea Their spring rolls were hard and tasteless again all I remember is saltiness Their lighting is harsh they don t serve alcohol and their waitstaff while friendly has such a poor grasp of English that ordering will be a tortured process of repetitions menu pointing and wondering if you ll get what you actually tried to order In short Do Not Go Instead go to Shabu Ya around the corner A world of difference 
-f8N9ddbKEu8jJOcYUqu5g CMU First floor Apparently this place was recently renovated it was well worth it The decor was relaxing comfortable nothing like other Hong Kongs I ve been to with cheesy dragons paintings on the wall The food was inexpensive 7 50 for my plate just under 9 for hubby s Our dinners came almost immediately after we finished our 1st round of drinks which were not all fruity watered down as others have mentioned The plate was full but not overwhelmingly so therefore no major food coma induced I had a combo plate with chicken fingers crab rangoons fried rice though the fried rice could have used some onion or spice the crab rangoons were perfect Third floor We met our friends for the Comedy Studio show Hong Kong provides food drink there as well The crab rangoons were just as tasty we had many scorpion bowls I was a bit disappointed with them as they weren t as potent as I m used to for 15 you would think they would knock me on my ass Anyways all in all a good place for dinner drinks though you may want to avoid the scorpion bowl 
-HJr0ZRrWZRmDEwOdeSarA CMU Known for Scorpion Bowls and co eds A fun time AND a hang over in the morning Dancing upstairs bar scene downstairs 
-hMsvV0oy5foyoj6oDurcw CMU Okay so normally I would absolutely HATE a place like this I hate the kind of clientle that goes here If you have read my previous reviews I normally look way down upon these types of establishments But I ll be god damned if they don t know how to treat a bunch of assholes who s main goal is to get as fucked up as possible Lemme tell you a little story We were having a send off party for one of my friends who was moving out to Japan to work doing the so called Harvard Gauntlet which consists of touring every Harvard Square bar doing shots We did the one in the place in the Cambridge Hotel did OM 50 bucks at the time OUCH Redline eh did a few others and somehow ended up at Casablanca s We go to Casablanca which is a mistake in itself but we go What do you have to drink and they say We don t do shots so we go Do you have any Long Island Iced Teas or something heavy And while we were being not so classy he had the nerve of going Yeah why don t you guys go to the Hong Kong that s more of your kind of place with this utter arrogance So we did and met up with the bouncer manager dude We told him of our plight and he goes Yeah I fired that kid come to our place and we re gonna take care of you Taking care of us meant that he gave our party of five people half full glasses about 3 shots worth of Yager for FREE That my friends is what sticks in my mind and I will remember for a long time We tipped heavily I banged my forehead on the corner of the table and somehow we stumbled out after four scorpion bowls the Yager and a few beers I didn t feel awkward I didn t feel weird Just good times I went home hammered with a bleeding forehead and nothing but happy thoughts as my best friend s girlfriend puked all over Mass Ave Not somewhere I m going to bring a date but if I wanna finish the Harvard Gauntlet this is where I m going to go 
-JdPkWfxUilb2AnRw_2Rbw CMU In a world where everything seems in a continual state of upheaval it s nice to know that there are a few constants I spent most of my twenties drunk Okay I spent ALL of my twenties drunk I spent most of my twenties drunk at the Hong Kong This was in the 90 s You didn t go there to discuss Proust over wee glasses of port you didn t go there to meet your soulmate and you certainly didn t go there for the FOOD You went there to suck down Scorpion Bowls fish around drunkenly in the ice for the little plastic animals and then go upstairs and dance lewdly and inappropriately with people you wouldn t give the time of day to in your sober lucid hours This was the case in 93 and so it is today This place gets three stars for consistency and reliability in these mad mad times 
-KcsRc4UR5aT8CkfkgIo4A CMU The last review was from early December and maybe this place has improved the kimchi broth was excellent very homemade ish I make kimchi soup often and the tom kha was ok too much lemongrass The quality of all the vegetables especially the mushrooms was excellent as was the beef and pork My friend had the yaki soba which she devoured I ate everything except for the greens which I didn t like The service was fine although our waiter needed to raise the volume a bit On a cold day like today I was perfectly happy to boil my mouth and fingers with some hot cabbage broth Now I want to go to Shabu Ya 
-nadSqTtnbzMgRonS2i-bA CMU Back East on family business from Portland OR Decided to revisit my favorite lunch place from the 80 s when I lived in Cambridge and worked at MIT Back then Mary s was located across the street and was BYOB Wow The memories flooded back as I enjoyed my old favorites Suan La Chow Show and Dun Dun Noodles I ve found Suan La Chow Show at Chinese restaurants in Arlington and Peabody but they are in a sweet sauce not the delightful spicy one served at Mary s Cash only but moderately priced Topped things off on the way out with a chat with Mary about the old days Chinese restaurant heaven 
-sWCaMxx8emOa_uqFTJNEA CMU I got take out from Thailand Cafe my very first day in Cambridge I had been moving boxes all day long and had yet to go to the grocery store and having lived in Thai saturated neighborhoods for seven years it was a natural thing for me to do to order Thai food when I was hungry and had nothing to eat I looked around online and was a bit taken aback by how expensive Thai food was in general compared to NY 10 vs 7 and then found Thailand Cafe which has more reasonable prices My roommate tried to warn me that this might not be the best place to order from but I thought eh how bad can it be Bad I ordered drunken noodles or whatever they call this dish and the noodles were rubbery and all stuck together in one clump The vegetables did not seem fresh there was virtually no basil and generally the dish was lacking flavor Hands down worst Thai food I ve ever eaten the only reason I m not giving it one star is because I feel badly doing that after only one experience and when others seem to think this place has some merit but my food was so bad that I m not sure I can bring myself to go back I d rather pay 3 more and get food that is remotely enjoyable I m surprised to see so many four star reviews of Thailand Cafe 
-SwNslZ9U6E41LK61ClVvw CMU 2 words terrible food 
-uglV6LB1Nr02Oeu69lptQ CMU I still remember this place and I ate there almost 12 years ago What stands out The infamous scorpion bowl an alcohol paradise for cheap college students anywhere within the vicinity It s a fun college hangout but thats about it Ahhh bite me bowl strike hard 
-uQhCP0VNMOZnLy4zhTRNw CMU Scorpion Bowl how I love thee You make me so happyyyyyy We stopped here while sightseeing Harvard Yard giving my husband a chance to relive his college days of scorpion bowl races with friends The pupu platter was almost completely fried with the largest donut shrimp I ve ever seen All pretty good but not quite up to the legend of the Bowl 
-_iiQF3EV7qi2zWYjYL7Og CMU This is my new favorite hole in the wall within walking distance serving mixed Asian cusine in Cambridge Okay a lot of qualifiers but still shouldn t be discounted Sushi is fresh the chow mein too salty but also too yummy The egg plant in garlic sauce is delicious The place is a little bit ghetto fabulous minus the fabulous and the staff is bit FOB but super super nice I wanted a little white rice with my left over eggplant and they sent me home with a small heaping no extra charge That s very un asian usually asian cafe are staffed with really unfriendly people That uncharacteristic behavior combined with the yummy goodness makes me want to go back again for lunch tomorrow eventhough I just had dinner there today May be I ll even go back for dinner again Thumb s up the number of which is in debate but the key thing is that it s up Try it 
0-dzwBivuF3qwvV9zUcqCg CMU OMG people beware If I could give this place 5 stars I would Beware the name people it s very clear I went here because I was out and about and needed food quick and this was the first place on the map being disoriented by the sun it seems I did not make sense of the name So I went in sat down with my SO and he ordered some egg drop soup and some saus chicken with broccoli The egg drop soup was super oily when is egg drop soup 99 oil it tasted so nasty I almost barfed the acid in my stomach on the table the chicken smelled odd like when you leave it in the fridge and you know you re hungry it s almost about to go bad but you risk food poisoning cause you re broke and you cook it That type of chicken I munched on some oily egg rolls and got a stomach ache afterwards Food poisoning at its best people needless to say I m running away from Pu Pu Hot Pot because I made exactly what it s called in my toilet bowl 
01E0UPSyFqDCmk3_UFEneQ CMU If you re looking for Chinese food don t come to the Kong If you re drunk and looking for Chinese food at 2am definitely come to the Kong 
07Na-aBrgqBucH_WCcpgpQ CMU It was rainy I was looking for something quick and nearby But I d never make the mistake of eating here again The pad thai had about four slivers of chicken in it over a container of noodles There were no scallions and practically no peanuts The best part of my lunch was the thai iced tea 
0aHr50OLiJRKowXGXR7Kew CMU Chinese restaurants are dime a dozen in the Boston area Mary Chung s is worth the trip to central square good luck finding parking but that should not keep you from this under the radar Chinese restaurant The Suan La Chow Show soup is awesome very spicy and outside the norm of egg drop or wonton soup The egg rolls are good decent meat to vegetable ratio but smaller in size The food is very well priced and is just great some of my favorite dishes are Szechuan Spicy Chicken Diced Chicken with Peanuts Chung s Spicy Beef and any of the Moo Shi dishes 
0gQExV0p4mZsZ4KzevE-Wg CMU Came here for dim sum but was slightly disappointed that it wasn t the traditional dim sum that is normally served The food wasn t terrible but when you re looking for some har gow and cheung fun and the dim sum place doesn t have it you get slightly heart broken 
0hUAUmYrdPNJRJCeI9ZaVg CMU Since I m over 21 I m too old to hang out in the bar upstairs but I have been to the restaurant on the 1st floor many a time for their delicious and cheap lunch specials For 6 50 you can get rice with veggies shrimp plus an egg roll and of course free tea Very simple and nothing to go ga ga over but a tasty cheap lunch option tough to find both in Harvard Sq 
0JFz6ztHJ7M6fzaZ-A5Ovw CMU It didn t exactly look like new restaurant inside bright tungsten lights mixed with florescent tube lighting random pictures fake flowers and limited seating etc Read I would never choose to go here on a date night because It completely lacks atmosphere and charm But I was there to eat with friends right That being said the Lachew Cauliflower dumplings app was tasty but over fried The Vegetable Manchurian was good with rice but nothing I can t get a Kashmir across the street The Singapore Noodles were enjoyable too but needed more shrimp it only had one and sausage Not the freaky looking ham that Azn B calls out Combined my friends and I left full and content with what we ordered Also we thought our server had been very helpful friendly and patient with our indecision I appreciate that always All in all there is much better out there but I like the concept I just hope they get the chance to take it up a few notches before Yelpers kill it 
0mdubbFPHYZIWMj8KoOMiQ CMU This is absolutely not worth the prices The waitstaff seem to have never waited tables A guy came out and basically threw my Corn Soup with Crab no crab to be seen btw on the table and goes here ya go and walked away The food is ok but more on par with like a low rent Chinese joint where you pay like 6 an entree not 17 I mean even P F Changs blows this place out of the water Will definitely not be going back If I m going to spend 70 for 2 people there are MUCH MUCH better options in Boston 
0Nhf5OPj5kCJDlkhWnFaFQ CMU Ok every review I ve done so far has been 4 stars I swear I have discerning taste you will see as I continue to rate things Down in Atlanta we had a similar company called Zifty Mixmenu is far superior in most ways Mixmenu is a website that allows you to order food delivery or pickup from a ton of local restaurants The price ranges and delivery charges vary from place to place There are many choices available which have no delivery fee Some restaurants use their own delivery people some use mixmenu s I think it s great that they list restaurants using both types of delivery methods not just a site for mixmenu deliveries The only negative I have found is the poor searching mechanism for the site I find myself just browsing through when it would be simple to add an effective searching script into the existing site 
0PmBxe9SnFLsbVKPZc0r4w CMU Wow This was the worst chinese meal I ve ever had I was lured in by the magazine reviews I d seen but came away not only disappointed but borderline sick Something clearly is wrong here I sense that a key chef has quit or something of that order The only thing decent was the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer The Salmon in bean sauce was so sloppily done that they might as well have used canned salmon The beef with tangerine strips was inedible as opposed to slices strips of beef they served chunks of low quality meat covered with a horrendous sweet sour sauce Truly one of the worst meals I ve EVER had Stay away 
0UDUr-zNOVepotwFABc-fA CMU This place is great I love the old school chinese feel with the lazy susans and the jasmine tea service Everything we got here was delicious and will def be coming back 
0VBsfsqq-5QfWFXvyqfzmg CMU Three stars for the food five stars for the memories which averages out to three stars for the food because you probably don t give a damn about my memories Thailand Cafe is one of those places you love because it s crappy The chicken is dry the veggies are blah and the spices aren t quite right But This place is perfect when it s late at night and you re cramming for a test and you don t want to bother finding food so you call for delivery and get a pad thai in 7 minutes flat for just as many dollars Word of advice always get this delivered or takeout You get a truckload of food in a styrofoam box much more than what they d give you when dining in 
0XDMjm2ff3tv0gVm018e7A CMU I like Mary Chung But I don t love it I m Chinese and grew up with a bowl cut Mary Chung reminds me of a Chinese restaurant in Saskatoon where the White family down the street took me when they wanted to impress me with their chopstick skills in the 80s 
0xPedhtepFq3psRFEm7QSg CMU I dont even remember the first time I came here or who introduced me too it But it was Love But from reading all the other reviews just now I think I havent been eating real Thai all along now Im disappointed The place is a little small the service isnt always the best but for what you pay portions you can beat it The Pad Thai is like someone else noted Not the worst I have had They use the freshest vegetables in most dishes which does make a big difference I would recommend the Beef Macadamia I am addicted would recommend if in Central Square looking for something to eat 
0yn29rcTgGYZovxiM7OCFw CMU It breaks my heart to give this review I was so excited that a shabu place was coming to Harvard But the fare was so awful that we actually left about three bites into the meal and I have never done that before I ve eaten shabu many times most often at spots in Chinatown or Allston Brighton so this review is not out of ignorance Sushi the salmon sashimi was cut wrong and from the wrong part of the fish It was mushy floppy and had too much of that gray fatty skin on it Shabu The meat was awful chicken dryer and beef way way tougher chewier than at other shabu spots The broth was NOT broth but plain old fatty chicken stock This gave the veggies and meats a bad flavor The dab of soy sauce tsuru was way too salty it should have been much less salty and served more liberally Service They clearly don t have their game down The meal came out in fragments the meat came out about 10 minutes before the veggies and the broth had been boiling away for some time when we finally got to start cooking They gave us a single broth pot rather than one with a divider We asked to switch and they did so right away There were more servers than customers and yet service was still slow and a bit clumsy Layout The tables don t seem quite big enough for shabu There were just 2 of us at a table for 4 but the food was cramped and took up the whole table so we were reaching across the boiling pot and hotplate to reach the meat and veggies Not sure how it would fit 4 people Management They were very concerned when we asked for the check and asked lots of questions We certainly appreciated the concern and they actually didn t let us pay though we wanted to After hearing what we thought was wrong with the meal they explained it by saying that they serve Chinese shabu this is Thai shabu But given that shabu is Japanese we weren t really convinced Goodness I hope they get it together I will be dropping cash here once they do Update I will now be dropping cash at Shabu Ya the other new shabu shabu joint that just opened up in Harvard Square Take heart shabu fans 
114QIdpHcAHT7zZ36FZtgw CMU This is the easiest review I ll ever have to write Night time Scorpion Bowls Drunk Harvard undergrads with an occasional sprinkling of a 20 something crowd tons of dancing Day time Scorpion Bowls and decent chinese food Recommended for people who like to get drunk hit on undergrads while dancing 
14Jt7p4kfCXC1To1mfugzA CMU The quality of the meats here are of particularly poor quality The two times I ve gone I have been literally injured by my food razor sharp chicken bones hidden in my supposedly boneless meat The veggies have always seemed rather squishy in a way that doesn t make me too confident about their freshness When they mean spicy they REALLY mean spicy For some dishes the spice is great and as a spicy food lover I really enjoyed it However there are some dishes here that are frankly terrible because any flavor is completely offset by how spicy they make it If you are sensitive to spicy food I suggest you go elsewhere almost everything here has a bit of bite to it Chinatown may be a bit of a hike but it is worth it to find much cheaper fresher and better balanced food 
14quuErYK60egEkhGrmd7Q CMU SUPER for VEGETARIANS All meals can be made vegatarian Waiter was very friendly and brought us a free appetizer There is outdoor dining but the fence is so high you can t people watch and none of your friends can spot you either SO If you want privacy but your date wants to dine outside GO HERE smile BUT The lobster with hot garlic sauce I ordered was very forgetable The menu implied it was a sauteed dish yet my LOBSTER ARRIVED IN THE SHELL just chopped into pieces My dish came with NO VEGETABLES AT ALL My partner was served PLAIN WHITE RICE in a side bowl 
18sLGB0ZE5uNEznIxDBolQ CMU First off bravo for serving for meat on a stick Bravo Sure the concept of a scorpion bowl is cool but considering the small amount of alcohol for 15 I could get more buzzed off a big gulp slurpee from Qwik E Mart If you and your crew can get drunk off one of these note I have drunk one by myself you need to step up your game That being said the bartender is cool shit and very courteous Plus the 6 Jack on the rocks are generously poured which is a rarity here in puritanical Boston Still 6 Jager shots or 6 any shots for that matter are overpriced All in all I really enjoy this place The staff does seem to appreciate your business which you don t see often 
1DxerEzBAaqWxB3y5SBzrw CMU This is a good place to get some good Chinese food on the cheap Some of their dishes are better than others but generally they re all pretty good I ve noticed the service can be hit or miss but most of the time it s been fine Seating has never been a problem A couple of times they ve had Chinese mountain cabbage as a special which I actually liked quite a bit especially considering it s just cabbage I d recommend it for a healthy well depending on what s in the sauce side dish They don t take credit cards which catches some people by surprise 
1fLY8N2vgGXW55c5PbxxtA CMU Have you tried a Scorpion Bowl yet Sarah Hey have you been to Hong Kong yet for a Scorpion Bowl Hey Sarah you need to go try a Scorpion Bowl etc etc etc I think that since moving to boston besides people telling me that I am going to freeze this would be the second most mentioned thing to me so I guess Scorpion Bowls are up there with the Red Sox in this city At least according to how often I ve heard about it This venue is supposedly not as cool as the one in Boston but for being closer to my house I m down The upstairs is the bar downstairs is the restaurant and my one pet peeve is they do not have vents on their AC vents and we were all FREEEEEZZZZZING If our Scorpion Bowls had any less alcohol in them they probably would have frozen over And you ask what a Scorpion Bowl is Well it is a giant bowl full of about 7 8 shots of premixed alcohol and fruity juice served with a couple REALLY LONG straws and plastic animals like a giraffe elephant monkey and a mermaid were thrown on top Random right I would think little plastic scorpions would have been thrown in but I guess that would probably gross customers out BUT it is pretty tasty and definitely packs a punch We got a pu pu platter too but honestly it was just fried and greasy not so great the spring roll tasted way way over fried and the won tons just leaked oil so next time we ll pass on that and focus on the scorpion bowl 
1fnreo0yAN27QR8ayP3ftA CMU I ve eaten here a couple times since I wrote my initial review and I ve decided to drop a star because they aren t as great as I first thought they were I think it s the atmosphere the servers are nice but the place has a homely feel to it And now with Shabu ya down the street there really is no reason to come here anymore except for the mango and sticky rice dessert which is very yummy Sorry Shabu Square 
1GNcpDVYdkYYCvgLn2AcDQ CMU Mary s is all about the red ink dishes If you don t like spicy you ll probably wonder why people love the place so much For the most part the dishes printed in black ink are nothing special though some of the appetizers are solid I have a weakness for the Crab Rangoon But if you DO enjoy a bit of burn you ll love the Suans the Dun Dun noodles the hot and sour soup and just about any spicy main dish But maybe not the chicken velvet I just can t get past the texture of that The Peking ravioli and the scallion pancakes aren t spicy by themselves but the spicy dipping sauce that comes with them is what makes them really special Have the ravs at the restaurant they don t travel well Wine and beer are available the wine list is limited to house red and white and the beer list is short but has a couple of good choices No dessert at all Mary gave up on them years ago If you crave a sweet after your meal walk across the street to Toscanini s 
1HlVtppyVL2qcJgryrTDNg CMU This small spot is a a bit of a hidden gem It is not a place you would even think to go into unless someone told you it was ok as the curb appeal leaves a bit to be desired The food is quick and flavorful It is hard to find a table during a weekday lunch as it is a popular spot among many local workers It is much quieter at dinner because it does not have a dinner ambiance Service is quick 
1HUMm-FwUsLBIbylcGojFg CMU Despite Mary Chung s sketchy looks we decided to take out here after the recommendation of a friend and yelpers We got szechuan chicken and dun dun noodles The chicken was okay at first Then we ate some noodles and the spiciness spread in our tummies like a horrendous flame We both really like spicy especially bf but this wasn t the type of spice that has a wonderful rich roundness and body to it It was a harsh and abrasive hotness After a couple bites I couldn t taste any actual flavors just an aggressive onslaught of salt 
1iceyy11axU7ejUDB6diuA CMU I only went once but most of the crucial menu items were decidedly sub par I haven t gone since the renovation so I m sure the ambience will be better at compensating for the poor food 
1ktUeLJVOfF_G9Vp69wiHQ CMU If you re living near MIT and you need Thai pick up that s walkable then maybe this is a good option I d already discounted my opinion given they do mostly take out but I was still disappointed Noodle dishes are all a bit watery flavor is just so so and thai iced tea was watered down I gave the usual khap khun krap to say thank you in Thai but the owners and wait staff just stared blankly Seriously if you re going to run a Thai restaurant at least understand hello and thank you 
1piRUGc-6JD1_wbxIAz3Vw CMU World s finest dun dun noodles right here Seriously I ve been around the world and have had dun dun noodles in many cities on several continents and these are my favorite With chicken or without they re cheap hearty and spicy as hell The dumplings aren t bad either Downside tea is awful and many dishes aren t bad but are pretty ordinary No credit cards so hit the ATM before you come here 
1Ru3ulfyd0QNZa17gv3tlA CMU more beijing than tokyo the small corner restaurant at Main and Windsor has been empty ever since its indian predecessor closed down so was excited to check out the new kid on the block since it was the first day open I won t ding this place too much on execution but a more knowledgeable wait staff a complete menu they apparently were out of curry and had no teriyaki because the grill was not in service and some music to liven up the quiet place would be some nice changes to see the menu presents mostly sushi and chinese dishes with a sprinkling of thai korean and japanese entrees I include the quotations because despite the diversity of food we ordered all had a very chinese food taste to it the sashimi was pretty fresh which is good news since there s nowhere in the immediate area to get decent well any really sushi but otherwise the food was nothing remarkable considering you have royal east across the street and mary chung s about a block away 
1t0PzyIBdLp2xYhY8dBgLA CMU Decent food nothing spectacular your standard sub par americanized chinese but still good when your craving some rangoons or some pork fried dumplings which are actually pretty good What I do LOVE about this place are the scorpion bowls and the little animals that come in them 
1VLLXyK9-rwiuQXcQpCyOQ CMU The Kong is a religion It may have an address and a website and I hear a menu but it s the following that s most telling All walks of life few basic tenets and the faithful are insanely devout First floor Oh right It s a restaurant Second floor Crazy packed den of barely legal sin Third floor Crazy packed den of barely legal sin set to motion Hey mister DJ The only food I ve ever consumed at the Kong were the cherries in my scorpion bowls Well drinks run 6 with a decent pour but good luck getting one The newly anointed class of drunkards to be crowd the bar and order the most abysmal drinks on the planet We need six shots of Jager two Long Islands a surfer on acid two cosmos with bubble gum vodka and a Sam Summer Looking past the rookie choices the bars tend to be understaffed on the busiest nights or in the case of Floor3 dance parties limited to a single person Still a pretty fun spot to cut some shapes with friends you know And if you re lucky you might catch a glimpse of Blair H working his magic Show up half cocked lest you realize the decision made sober and subsequently hate yourself for it 
1Yps7S4MLzyLQ6eSgSV_qQ CMU Wow I really would have expected something better from Newbury Street 1 Slow service We were there at 8 15PM Our food took 40 minutes to arrive our waiter was nowhere to be seen and he never gave us an update as to why Our appetizer in fact arrived at the same time as the entrees 2 No AC Yes I realize we ve been under a heat wave and that causes ACs to blow out but seriously how about a fan 3 The food could be better I love Indian food I love Chinese food I know that there is a strong fusion culture that this restaurant is based off of We got the hakka chili paneer and hawker style hot garlic chicken and they tasted the same That being said the food IS flavorful we could have come on a better day 4 I actually disagree with most of the reviews that say the portions are small and expensive This IS Newbury Street I expected prices like these and the portions are actually quite generous 2 stars for slow service no AC and mediocre food 
2-VBSi1PVJjRuQZ-WSLHOA CMU A total kiddie dive but fun for what it is you may even leave with a Harvard co ed I was curious when I forced to check my coat in order to abide by the no hood rule but otherwise a good time I mean when in Rome or Hong Kong scorpion bowls are fun 
20xfExWAWAbxsN2Dpxf4TA CMU I love you guys and I always have fun at hong kong but your bouncers need some more training I went tonight with a girl using a fake id I m 22 and from Pennsylvania She s 20 from California I was denied and had to find a way home my friend got in and met up with our other friends When I asked the bouncer why my id doesn t work he responded that the lamination and picture are wrong He said he sees tons of PA id s and that mine is fake Thanks for reading this and I hope they can learn for the future 
23fZkETneAl2mowgp8d_DQ CMU Cheap Friendly foods are ok Be aware you need to bring cash because they don t take credit cards 
2aCbvTQTJ0HmilStZynpmA CMU I have been to the Kong maybe three or four times mainly because it s close to where my friends live In those travels I have picked up the following tips on making this place less likely to suck 1 Bring two forms of picture ID My first time going there the bouncer asked all of us for two forms of photo ID which I did not have The only reason I was able to get in was because my brother had two IDs and the addresses on our drivers licenses matched so the bouncer conceded that mine must be real Generally the bouncers here are blatant jackasses they let our friend from Ghana who has a foreign ID in one week and the next they said that the very same ID card looked fake and would not let her in So no matter what be prepared to have some issues at the door 2 If you go into the bar order ANYTHING but a Scorpion Bowl As many others have noted they taste like watered down Kool Aid and are served in unwashed bowls gag gag gag You d probably contract less germs from licking a toilet 3 On that note try to avoid the bathrooms I can t speak for the men s room but the stalls in the ladies room are about 2 x 2 and require a staggering feat of contortion to be used without making a mess Since most of the frequenters are trashed and need to evacuate the copious amounts of alcohol they ve consumed the situation gets grim fast 4 Go with a group The music on the dance floor usually kicks off with campy 80s hits Hey Mickey really that are only fun if you re dancing like a fool and joking around with other people who appreciate the godawfulness of the situation The selection usually gets good later on but the DJs can be spotty to say the least 5 Make sure there s a guy included in your group If you re female and care about keeping your personal bubble intact you will need a male line of defense against the sketchy Tonys and Viggos and Werts who will stand in the corner of the dance floor leering at you for 25 minutes before they attempt to swoop in like horny vultures and feast on you by way of skanky grinding 6 Watch where you step while you re dancing Invariably some dingbat manages to spill his her drink all over the floor or if you re lucky all over you and invariably some other dingbat doesn t notice and takes a nasty fall as a result Make sure that 1 you are not either of those dingbats and 2 that if the second dingbat is near you don t get taken down in the process Those are my tips for making the Kong standable Even if you follow all of them there s a good chance that the evening will be a bust but it at the very least it makes for fun geez can you believe that happened stories afterward 
2aVwJysWfx3viqyEvrqc1A CMU The thai food here ranges from terrible to ok The pad thai is really bad but their tropical chicken is passable I haven t tried any other dishes but from what I ve heard and what I ve tried I would stay away from the thai menu The sichuan food on the other hand is generally much better Nothing can compare to Sichuan Gourmet all the way out in Framingham but at least this place tries Some of the flavors are really nice but my biggest complaint is that the dishes themselves are a bit tedious When you order the Chong Tsing Dry Hot Chicken the initial flavors are amazing But there s nothing else to it all you get is chicken a LOT of pretty much inedible hot peppers and a bed of rice Similar story for the King Pao Chicken though replace hot peppers with peanuts For a lunch dish I d expect at least some vegetables or something to go along with it If on the other hand you re doing family style it s probably great 
2BFXWpE7aKGnPgDNcrnssQ CMU One meal was enough here The food was ok but very salty even for chinese The service was good if not overly helpful The best part is they have homemade noodles that are pretty good But steer clear of the moo shi get it some place else 
2g0z-afF5WbUqKxCgw6DqA CMU I guess Boston and I disagree on a lot of things Three and a half stars I respectfully disagree We ordered spicy szechuan chicken and another shrimp dish that was also spicy The best part of the whole trip was that when the waitress asked medium rice my dad responded with hot rice Obviously my dad was born without any taste receptors except for those that sense spiciness To his defense I ve actually also liked Chinese food that was spicy and had other flavors as well However whenever I go to a Chinese food place it can never seem to pack enough heat Mary Chung you deserve a prize You have a recipe for spiciness happiness and flavor I couldn t be happier that I found this place Yes its a little bit pricy but what isn t in Boston I can t really remember exactly what else we ordered it was a shrimp dish with water chestnuts and some other black vegetable Five stars Love this place Although Mary Chung still has to pass the litmus test my fiancee s taste buds are a little more astute than my own and if she says no then I m in trouble 
2GRxdFh1zOqYcZ5P9cUK1Q CMU When I lived in Hong Kong I ate so much Shanghainese food that my friends joked that I should just marry a Shanghainese man XD Although I used to have dessert take outs from Yenching as a student I was never particularly impressed by it Nonetheless when I was back in Harvard Square to meet up with some friends I am pleased with the vegetarian options there Surprisingly I had the most authentic Shanghainese dumplings and springrolls in the States there Definitely coming back with friends next time P S I wish Yenching put the dumplings in a traditional bamboo container to keep them warm Food 3 Decor 3 Service 4 
2HPg9bAWwkVJO0n_hf9A1Q CMU Given the number of times I ve had the pleasure of frequenting the Hong Kong I m surprised that I don t remember much else besides the Scorpion bowls go figure But I always manage to have a better than average time so 4 stars it is Seriously its a touch sketchy but what good bar isn t The second floor is where its at and its the kind of place I like to go if I m with a group of people It s definitely not a place to go out and have a classy night out with just a friend date 
2HqsqUo26oxHDfpFKhg2yg CMU We returned tired of burittos and other fast food fare We found the onwer manager who had seemed only coarse and antagonistic before to possess another side To any and all who were put off by her seemingly harsh manners I would suggest she can also be warmhearted and friendly with customers who have a sense of humor As always take opinions with a grain of salt especially as they relate to judging others 
2HuNbO22zfKRoraCIzSttQ CMU I prefer the other Hong Kong but this place isn t bad I m reviewing the bar upstairs not the restaurant It s the kind of place where you can drink your face off and dance if you feel like it There s a club on the third floor and sometimes you ll see a long line trying to get up there My only big problem here is the bartenders really suck They tend to cater to their friends and boobs I understand but it s why they end up with a crappy tip I don t ask for much just a quick passing of the beer from the cooler to my hand It takes a fraction of the time required to make some chick s fruity mixed drink I only go here when a bunch of friends are headed there 
2I0y7E5QUeHXB9aLhYCNSQ CMU We have not lived in Boston for 20 years but Mary Chung s is still the Szechuan restaurant against which we measure all others First of all you can t get Suan La Chow Sho anywhere else we ve looked Those beautiful dumplings in that addictive spicy sauce are what I compare all Szechuan spicy dumplings to and I have rarely found any that measure up candidates are generally too oily or hot but not flavorful And Mary Chung s other dishes are typically fresh tasty and well prepared During our recent visit we shared Chung s spicy beef very tender meat and the day s special mustard greens mild and crunchy and healthy tasting 
2l40ebuvtO8W9li3evXYjg CMU I m about as Chinese as the pope is Jewish so I have no idea if this is truly authentic or not What I do know is that the menu lacks general gau s which is a good thing in my book and I love the food I ve had some amusing times here thanks to a language barrier but the service has always been first rate Once or twice I ve been so stuffed that I couldn t finish and Mary came over to ask if everything was alright She was worried when she saw I wasn t a member of the clean plate club Now how many times do you see that these days Seriously Mary as long as your food and service stay top notch keep on being closed tuesdays and only accepting cash I really don t mind 
2MLohjYkLd8M90A4dqdQYA CMU I have been going here for years No doubt they have the best schezuan chicken Service is friendly I was little dissapointed with their delivery because the portioning was little small than what they serve in the restaurant and the quality of the food wasn t the same Overall it s a great place o dine in 
2pcoNDU1grTFkt3KZ-xmUA CMU Mary s is the best Chinese food in the city Perfectly priced and extremely good quality I have never had a bad meal there Suan La Chow Show Dry cooked sliced beef steamed peking ravolis and their chicken wings Absolutely amazing 
2zkhEArjvjxVtLcNhFYEJw CMU As a veggie I have searched out tofu dishes throughout the area I always go back to PuPu for their Szcheuan Broccoli and Tofu The broccoli is always at that perfect stage between raw and overcooked with that bright green hue that says fresh The tofu is 90 perfectly done on occasions I have found it overly done perhaps having sat around too long And both are in a perfect sauce In general my family and I love this place We also love their kofu seitan and mushrooms and the the veggie dumplings steamed I have never found it to be greasy but we usually only order the veggie dishes and never order deep fried foods 
3-523cJePmfDAjlAMhN-hQ CMU The owners take real pride in this restaurant Great food at reasonable prices A great eatery for Harvard students and faculty and ppl who work in the square Great food in a great location 
31X2kLVQzPrCPKPyGxXR7Q CMU This place had mixed reviews I liked the drinks they helped us need a taxi ride back home The music and the dancing were great The food well I am from Asia and well let s say they would have a problem if they were in the Hong All in all we had a great time and by the forth round we had more fun than we should have The bathroom provided a completely new experience and I lived in a dorm till this year I have never seen the gymnastics that I witnessed wow that girl will be in X rated films Thank you yelp for helping me plan my weekend 
35sWYwY1Bf6piuvJTqmNUA CMU Just giving this the average rating so that the average isn t affected by what I say This place seemed to be closed when I tried to go there last Friday Oct 10 The street sign is still there but they seemed to have moved out of their actual space Remodeling Or maybe they actually closed Anyway just a heads up if you want to try this place 
39qopr4rZgYs3LIxnzfZIQ CMU Growing up in the South I have found that there are extreme differences between chinese food there versus New England You can order the exact same dish in each region and get a completely different experience For example lobster sauce in the North is a brown sauce with ground beef also added In the South it is a lighter white sauce with more veggies no ground beef Also what is it with serving rolls with chinese food But I digress My point being that I have yet to find a chinese place that I love in the Boston area after almost 10 years of trying Yenching comes close though Like the other reviews note the staff are ridiculously friendly bordering on being uncomfortably so Don t get me wrong I love good friendly service but when you literally end each sentence with sir it is almost condescending The food is pretty good but won t bowl you over I am not gourmet when it comes to asian cuisine outside of sushi as I tend to stick to the americanized standards but I enjoy it enough from here to make it my go to when in the mood for chinese At the very least it is worlds better than Hong Kong which is on the same block A little more expensive that you would expect but it is in the heart of Harvard Square so it makes sense Overall not the best but far from the worst 
3BPjLpQcHC9mgedB7wtMog CMU Bumping this up to 4 stars because the comedy club upstairs is actually really good I think it s 6 admission 6 nights a week at 8 or 8 30pm don t remember which Definitely a deal for how funny most of the acts are 
3Bz--ULTwlkamkIEy4AQug CMU Even for greasy Americanized faux Chinese this place is meh Staff are efficient but rarely friendly even when you speak Chinese the food is tasty but just loaded with the bad stuff grease MSG etc and obviously not authentic in any way I guess they have to cater to the college crowd though if there s any crowd that can afford good quality Chinese food wouldn t it be Harvard students And on that note I d avoid the crowded times unless you enjoy pretentious first years waxing eloquently about their posh privileged trust fund baby lives and congratulating each other on lowering themselves to dine at a greasy Chinese joint when they could easily afford No 9 Park instead Points for the comedy studio upstairs and the big stair workout you get though 
3P0THAi88csLox7_p98K7A CMU Nho H brought me to this restaurant a few months back to try the Suan La Chow It didn t disappoint Sufficiently spicy and combined with the bean sprouts it was an interesting mash up of textures I went there a second time and discovered that the Suan La Chow is the very same as their pork steam dumplings because their pork steam dumplings comes with a side of the spicy sauce hmmmm peculiar to repackage a dish with bean sprouts and call it a special nevertheless good I craved pork with preserved turnip because I ate it so much as a child you could say I was breast fed on that dish but the waitress kept telling me I wanted a different dish because this particular dish was made w canned preserved turnip Literally the conversation went like this me I want the pork with preserved turnip Waitress That s from a can you want Number Me is that preserved turnip also Waitress no Me ok I want preserved pork and turnip Waitress so you want Number Me no I want preserved pork and turnip Waitress points at number this one Me no points at preserved turnip and pork this one I think girl was just looking out but it was sort of annoying I would probably go back because food is decent proximate to my apartment and inexpensive But to all the rest don t set your service expectations too high 
3rUcXrGLwLmVRu9J6tlBIw CMU Royal East is the place to go If you re looking for a nice yet inexpensive lunch or if you re taking a group out to dinner this place on the corner of Windsor and Main street in Cambridge is where you want to be The food is always fresh and has a nice mix of southern Chinese authenticity and Americanized taste so it s perfect for those wanting a little more than Chinese take out If you re on the adventurous side you can always order the specials on the menu or try the squab you ll have to order it a day in advance so they can get the bird If you re craving even more authentic Chinese food or if southern Chinese is just not your thing you can always go down the street to Mary Chung in Central Square Ever since I discovered this place my freshman year of college I ve always come to Royal East for comfort food What I get when I m trying to settle down before finals or after a long day Shrimp stuffed eggplant with black bean sauce It s even better for lunch because for 7 bucks you get the entree rice and a bowl of soup The waiters are friendly speak both Mandarin and Cantonese if you re into that and will always keep your teapot and water glass freshened Come here with groups too Royal East is awesome when you order family style and they have the rotating tray for the food at the bigger group tables In short come here for a nice mix of Cantonese authenticity and old school Chinese flavor And order the shrimp stuffed eggplant D Oh yeah they deliver for free too if you order more than 25 Below that it s 3 to deliver 
3sjlI4AfrpnZbGe_1e5BkQ CMU sushi rolls delivery in central square yes sold it s good too no joke minus the chinese dishes that is 
3vExm0DvU63aLJGJHRo8ZQ CMU I used to come to Mary Chung s a lot back when I was in college mainly because it was reasonably priced decent quality Chinese food in a neighborhood with a dearth of good Asian food 8 years later I still like it for the same reasons It s not the best Sichuan food but it s a nice solid option when you re in Cambridge and want a quick inexpensive meal The only thing on the menu that really stands out for me is the Dun Dun noodles I love the spicy peanut sauce they put on there I m pretty sure that s not what Dun Dun noodles are like in China but hey it s still pretty good 
3w6n2c0xv28zKaBSjmTY_g CMU Pu Pu s pretty good for vegetarians their veggie wonton soup is out of this world as for other offerings they re not so stellar but still worth it if you live in the area and have a craving for chinese food My roommates and I used to order in from them pretty consistently but more out of habit than any real affection for the place 
3XQBExCHTQaZu8KXkfB1lg CMU You might not want to eat here because you may discover you really don t like Chinese food that is real Chinese food Unless you have had home cooked Sichuan Szechuan or been to China the taste sensations will challenge your palate in ways that it may not have been before The menu here is unapologetically authentic I went on a Tuesday for lunch and the place was quite full I m guessing the lunch crowd from Amgen et al keeps this place going because I have seen reports that it is always empty For lunch on a Tuesday it was packed I wanted to have the Rabbit but they were out so I started with Spicy Beef Tendon Pig Ears and Cucumbers and Bamboo Shoots with Wild Fern The tendons was very spicy and shaved wafer thin it did have the mouth numbing heat The pig ear was shaved slightly thicker but not too thick it less spicy but quite delicious We have been cooking bamboo shoots at home more and I m reall a fan of the fresh stuff sliced quasi julienne not like a can of overcooked LaChoy vegetables The texture of a more al dente shoot is wonderful The real star of the dish however was the wild fern which was heavily pickled This is the type of taste sensation I was eluding to before completely foreign to most western diners Cold and tangy yet crisp perhaps even a tad slimey Alternating bites of fern and bamboo made for a a real yin and yang counterpoint Since it was lunch I did get a special the Double Cooked Pork bellies These were served in a dry ish sauce that could have been more spicy with rough chopped long green peppers and leeks I devoured the entire plate in 3 minutes The menu has English and Chinese you don t have to hunt for the gems the Frog Rabbit etc are right out there they do have the spicy beef with napa cabbage that will be my next choice the service was slow only 1 waitress and hostess had the entire floor I did not hold it against the staff I did request brown rice but received jasmine rice instead food came out relatively quickly Excellent bar with large Single Malt selection I had a Tsing Tao to chill the spicy heat Fair wine list Two TV s at the bar SciFi channel and ESPN playing NIce layout with a small but cozy waiting area and hip furnishings 
3_alzNcCIPe-aubPW1Osbw CMU This place is a little wacky there s some grafitti on the outside door and the inside is decorated kinda nouveau riche I didn t really know what to expect as I walked in I went here on the recommendation of my friend who insisted via text since she lives in New York that I get the Dun Dun Noodles and the Suan La Chow Show The Suan La Chow Show was an appetizer and it was good and distinct from other chinese dumplings by a savory sauce Not my favorite but I would definitely have it again The Dun Dun noodles were also good although more spicy than I was prepared for Hhhhot We also got an appetizer platter that was mostly okay except for the fried wantons which were plain silly Why would I want to eat fried bread with nothing in it I think I should stick to my friend s recommendations I sampled the main dishes of the other people that I went with and they were fine but not so different from other chinese places I don t foresee me becoming a die hard Mary Chung s fan in the near future but I liked it well enough and I would be happy to go back 
4-e44QEjbds4TQ2qqIGHuA CMU I didn t even know that this place had an upstairs but thank god I figured that out The scorpion bowls are delicious and you get little treats inside the bowl plastic animals mermaids etc It s like opening up a Crack Jack box and finding a decoder ring inside I didn t try the food but it smelled good though I think I would ve eaten anything after inhaling two scorpion bowls Also I loved the crowd here Random people would walk up to us at the bar and get involved in our conversation It sounds like it would be obnoxious but it wasn t It was just a bunch of good people being curious about one another The music was great people were dancing and having a great time without being disrespectful and sloppy I really enjoyed my night and I will go back soon 
41C6bUH6x-Zgggq0gG43ZQ CMU If you want fancy overpriced food Mary Chung s is not the place for you But if you want some Szechwan down to earth cooking and are in a rush or short on currency Mary Chung s is right Things I like 1 wide variety of dishes 2 generous portions 3 non pretentious environment and polite staff Things I didn t like 1 could be a little cleaner 2 restroom is really tiny Things you should know 1 staff is polite but sometimes short on patience be kind to them 2 not sure if they take credit cards yet it has been cash only for a long time 
42QmHh0oKdgs40hB8Wr5wA CMU I was really excited about this place when my friend and I walked in I ve never had Indo Chinese food plus the decor was really beautiful There was even a man playing a sitar and it was only a Tuesday The service completely ruined the experience however My friend and I both have food restrictions I m allergic to wheat and oranges and she can t eat gluten I ve always felt like a huge burden to waiters even though I m merely asking them to do their jobs Experience in knowing what is likely to have my allergens has changed this for me dramatically but even telling the waiter about my allergies multiple times did not help at Mumbai Chopstix There was a special drink Mango Sangria When I asked him what was in it he just looked confused I asked if there s orange juice At first he said yes I said okay never mind at which point he went to find out it did NOT have OJ My friend asked about what kind of noodles were in one of the dishes regular noodles made from wheat or rice noodles He didn t even understand the question So she asked him to find out what kind of noodles they were the answer from the kitchen was they are noodles Since this guy obviously had NO CLUE I asked if there is soy sauce in the Hawker style Eggplant and Tofu dish just to be safe He replied okay no soy sauce I explained to him that I am allergic to wheat and soy sauce has wheat in it which most people don t know so that is why I am asking I would not expect hot garlic sauce to come with soy sauce in it to begin with from description it sounded like oil garlic and chili He didn t seem to get it but I was satisfied enough with his no soy sauce request to the kitchen After eating it however I am sure that there was wheat When he finally came back which wasn t till the end of the meal I asked what was in the sauce He told me it was JUST A SAUCE THEY HAD What I said to him Is there flour in the sauce I told you I am allergic to wheat so if there s flour in the sauce that is wheat you just served me something I told you I am allergic to Especially with the new allergy laws in MA I thought I didn t have to explain what food is made of and or get angry at waiters for them to pay attention to understand what they are serving He just looked confused again So he asked in the kitchen and told me there wasn t any in the sauce But I HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION FOR 3 DAYS after eating there In the 10 years I ve had these allergies I have never had something like this happen to me and I have had a lot of idiotic servers who have messed up Usually they apologize and offer to make up for it in some way Needless to say I do not recommend this restaurant I am only giving 2 stars because for a person without allergies the horrible service might not matter quite as much 
44cDkXVhot9ui3MHQxk7VA CMU Oh how I miss the Kong This is where we spent SO much of college I loved that they let me in starting my freshman year and then rented out the bar to me my junior year for my 21st birthday and that the scorpion bowls are delicious and dangerous at the same time and that you can eat Chinese food downstairs at the end of the night not the very best Chinese food but GREAT for late night snacking I can t wait to visit when I m back in Cambridge for the Harvard Yale football game 
45pF8qqmC8hxLGcL2x6OWQ CMU A nice place not far from MIT Great food fast service no credit cards accepted though Their wontons are freshly made and my boyfriend loves their don don noodles Atmosphere is very casual and no credit cards are accepted here Food is great and moderately priced We come here often and always have a very good time 
4b6Q9yKlE-we0JZyw5QgRA CMU Wipe away the MIT Cult of Mary Chung and you re left with a pretty boring restaurant The food is sort of Sichuanesque but it s been heavily sanitized the flavors are flat and insufficiently spicy and of course there is a lack of classic Sichuan type dishes It s the best Chinese food within a 2 minute walk of the Central Square T stop but if you walk another 5 minutes up to MuLan you get much better food 
4eaM9Gb8y1kTRfGgZKDBdw CMU I know it s juvenile I just cannot resist This place should be called Pu Pu on the Pot I remember going here years ago and it not being as gut wrenchingly awful as it was last night It s cheap but it s so bad I would never go there again Friendly in its own way The man claimed NO MSG which I doubt I only went here so I could go to Toscanini s after If you need Chinese in Central hightail it over to Mary Chungs Better yet get off your ass on the red line and go to the Gourmet Dumpling House which will ruin crappy AmeriChinese for you forever 
4Hp61FYGOL6eljZ3PB4lvw CMU Great especially for lunch Can be pretty greasy though especially if you order anything battered Very cheap lunch prices I LOVE 18 on their lunch menu glass noodles with veggies Be warned they re not open on Tuesdays and they only take cash 
4hZaOzZ1TyWd6N83cRaAcg CMU The food is so so but I give this 1 star because of the exceptionally rude service After dining in I was given the check which came out to 10 65 including tax I put down 11 because I didn t feel like their service and food quality merited regular tip The waitress comes by looks at the amount and asks me to put down more tip I was a bit too shocked to argue Not wanting to make a scene I put down 12 What comes next is even more outrageous She continues looking at the check and then as if exasperated picks up the check and then writes down 1 60 for tip I paid 13 total including this FORCED TIP This is OUTRAGEOUS This is illegal and unethical I m never eating here again 
4ihKOSpu79GScCNoWKmAsw CMU Dry over breaded chicken in the General s Stale Beef in the Chow Mein Fair Veggies Just edible Just Edible It s not so cheap either I just dropped 30 and I m not too happy that 30 could have been for a similar portion at Mu Lan so I am not sure what is to be gained eating here over someplace like Mu Lan which actually has really fresh and super yum yummy Chinese OK Taiwanese food None the less Every hood needs a Pu Pu Hot Pot Enjoy it Pot Dwellers it s all yours 
4i_tLrE-FqHKLaITcNE2Dg CMU RATING 2 5 stars rounded up for its scorpion bowl offerings and friendly service QUICK SUMMARY FOOD Not particularly authentic Chinese food but closer to actual Chinese food than to Americanized Chinese food However that is not saying much if you ve tried any Chinese food in the Harvard Square area 2nd FLOOR BAR They offer scorpion bowls 15 which is great for having large group outings The bowls did not have a significant amount of alcohol you won t experience much burn as you drink it which may be good bad depending on your motives and had a nice blend of fruit juices with pineapple being the most prominent SERVICE Friendly and courteous A big plus at a Chinese restaurant in the States SENTENCE SUMMARY Come here to get smashed and if you ate here you won t feel too bad if you spill your guts later in the evening from all the alcohol 
4mdEqIL25IRnoeWxeI5JFw CMU Being one of those who fit the category a person who misses Indian style Chinese food I had high expectations from this place given that it was after all listed on Restaurant Week earlier this year The crew We were a party of 8 almost all of us from the Indian subcontinent Seating on the upper floor was prompt on this long table which seemed to be diner style We asked for a regular table but were told that that big a party cannot be seated upstairs so we shuffled our feet down to the lower level The lower level at time of writing this review seemed a work in progress There were unfinished walls and hastily put decor But hey sometimes the best eateries have the most inconspicuous decor On Newbury probably not but I digress Our waiter helper was an interesting character Other than the fact that he seemed generally disinterested in helping us out there were three things that stood out for me 1 We saw the portion sizes on other tables We decided to go with X number of entrees He did a pretty hard sell for us to get X 1 items His Recommendation was not that great anyway and I felt like he was trying to unload some substandard menu item on us 2 With 8 people at a table it was not like we were blocking his access to any individual person But after we had all ordered he stood at one end of the table and haughtily asked everyone to pass the menu over When he said it the second time I had to tap my friend on her shoulder to interrupt her conversation just because our guy couldn t walk 5 steps and pick it up himself 3 Finally when we got the bill split it some of us paid cash and some put it on their credit card I think it is rude when wait staff picks up the PAID check and stares at the tip while people are still at the table He went a bit further though he in his oh so condescending tone asked everyone has everyone signed their credit card receipt NO DUDE we are leaving because we wanted to make your life harder WTH Anyway If I just had to rate the food I d give it a 3 3 5 but since I m rating the entire experience I ve decided not to go here again at least not on my tab 
4oHH9hz6ELnlusDdhaoEjg CMU I simply liked this place The lunch buffet was a great deal 7 50 per person and the choices while not a lot of them were fresh interesting and tasty I really liked the shrimp with veggies the spicy tofu and the Chinese donuts that were nicely crunchy and sweetened with a dusting of sugar Wonderful iced hot tea The rice was a bit crunchy and the egg rolls were pretty bland But the staff was gracious and attentive service was great We ll be back 
4qUEAFWLGBR-rWJ2Z3odqQ CMU Glad to see it hasn t changed since I last lived in the area It s halfway between a good Americanized place and an Americanized good Taiwanese place It s more authentic than the detractors say so shut up If they have the Chinese sausage special get it Cash only Love Central Square 
4rxhk8P7P42jE0rE01okSA CMU In a lovely old house on Newbury Street Ambiance is great except if you re seated next to the bathroom which we were even though the restaurant was mostly empty early on a week day An interesting menu with lots of dishes we wanted to try Unfortunately service was awful Waiter hardly gave us attention when he was taking our order and as a result got our order wrong The manager was gracious and comped us the dish we didn t order but overall this wasn t the pleasant family dining out experience it could have been 
4T5E1RqceWwbkwalNFqrLA CMU 3 5 Stars for Mary Chung s It s a good place to have in the neighborhod whenever I need my Chinese fix which to be honest isn t all that often since I generally find Thai and Vietnamese much more crave worthy It s nothing special decor wise but they do have a tasty scallion pancake and nice and spicy kung pao chicken Oh and they offer brown rice which I always appreciate The staff was attentive and friendly but literally asked us every time she came over if we needed a fork and knife Apparently we did not look like we could handle ourselves with our chopsticks I tried not to be offended Overall a good place decent food decent prices I m not running back to eat there again but I definitely wouldn t mind going back either 
4u31mpryuhTDzOiqzkNp0w CMU It s the best that I ve come across in the Cambridge area and they have really good veggie dishes and options Good traditional stir fried veggies like bok choi and spinach They are quick and we ve found freebies in the bag like extra spring rolls Very nice They have good veggie dumplings and I am partial to their scallion pancakes yum I also dig that they call you when they are downstairs versus hitting every buzzer 
4VIv4MqIBldxwnaBoYRSEA CMU If not for the Buy With Me deal we wouldn t have gone to this place And thank goodness for the deal or I ll give a ZERO star When we first arrived I asked the girl at the curb if they have lassi She told me she didn t know OK We went in waited a while and nobody came by to even give us some water for the longest time Turned out they do have lassi but that was the worst lassi I ve ever had I think they totally forgot to put in any sugar OR sugar is too expensive these days Then the appetizer Two really thin chicken spring rolls cost 6 And when we finished the appetizer the waiter didn t come to take the plate away and it actually stayed on our table for the entire meal Their tables were not American size for sure The amount of food is perfect if you re trying to go on a diet We had to ask for the second bowl of rice By the way when the waiter brought over the first bowl of rice his thumb was INSIDE my rice The food was average just like any Chinese restaurant out there Also you would think you ll be listening to either Chinese or Indian music while you eat but NO it was Japanese songs I knew it because I m Japanese At the end I couldn t wait to get out of there but it took at least 15 minutes from I asked for the check to I finally got my credit card back to sign The other 2 tables near us were done with their appetizers and waiting for the entree for longer than I ve got to sign my credit card Overall this was a horrible experience very expensive average Chinese food with extremely slow service I m still regretting being too generous on my tip which was 10 
4xNfKmV4Czhi7wY57rv_fQ CMU Very good food but a bit inaccessible Not really catering to ordinary Western palates However the atmosphere is wonderful plating is excellent and the mixed drinks are awesome If you re not accustomed to Szechuan food maybe take it slow order some drinks ask the bartender for a popular appetizer etc Oh I forgot to mention expensive 6 28 07 Have not been here in awhile Perhaps it s on its last legs given these reviews Reports on Chowhound about a decline in the food suggest that s the case A pity 
4YAfT8sZqzxpBcsAfAnEXg CMU Strangely within 24 hrs of Ligaya suggesting that this was my kind of bar I did end up here Well sorry but it s not I hated it Yes it s horrible yes it s overpriced yes the doorstaff are dickhead nazis yes the music sucks yes the crowd are idiots But wait The crowd are by and large Harvard idiots so is that an oxymoron Well yes and no because chances are that 99 of them are fairly lovely bright people during the day but when they ve got on their drink and party gear you can forget all those IQ points and resume filling good deeds they ve done They become monsters How do I know this A fine pedigree of Fifth Ave and DTMs in Oxford Horrible horrible places but with many good and very drunk memories True dives And for all the much older and obviously non Harvard people who I saw at HK WTF You re creepy Please leave 
4ZQQMIwDL3-O6qBTo9WZmg CMU GREAT food and GREAT service tough to find both in MA for sure Honorable mentions the General Gau s chicken and terriyaki I ve had several things off of the menu and NEVER have had a bad meal here The hot green tea is also very good Great for lunch 
56C5LkuWgNpWbSaomUj-TA CMU Not bad nothing spectacular but the lunch specials are a good deal Some coworkers and I had some Chinese food from Hong Kong when someone brought in take out around the holidays One of my co workers who actually happens to be Chinese had a craving for it yesterday so we decided to all go out The place was only about 20 full when we arrived at 12 30 I guess their bigger crowds are at night Our waitress was nice no issues there We all enjoyed some lunch specials for 7 50 I went with the sesame chicken which came with pork fried rice and boneless spare ribs All the food was good though the pork was a little fatty None of that excessively greasy heavy feeling you get with some chinese food The sesame sauce on the chicken was excellent My co workers both got the same thing lobster sauce with white rice and chicken wings I didnt try theirs but they enjoyed it For the three of us the check was under 25 You really cant beat that especially for a sit down lunch I ll be back 
58DRPIIuYKnF4T0JzZ73ag CMU I go to Mary Chung for lunch once a week it s the perfect spot for any lover of spicy foods All of their lunch specials are under 6 and my favorite item on the menu the Suan La Chow Show spicy meaty wantons are only 4 25 I also go for the hot and sour soup and the Dun Dun Noodles with Chicken So spicy and delicious I love this place to death but I ve noticed that some people are not on the same page with me I think they are disappointed by this place because when they think Chinese they want egg rolls and rangoons and chicken fingers and while you can definitely get some of that stuff they specialize in szechuan and I think they are going for a more authentic approach to Chinese cooking Also maybe the ambiance leaves something to be desired 
598NvRFX_NPvR0SFmkK-3A CMU Not bad not great I had the lunch buffet which included a soup and dessert for 9 The corn soup was a little lacking in substance Lots of broth and ginger but lacking on the corn and other veggies The entrees were alright The rice noodle salad was rather fresh but the vegetable fried rice was pretty bland overall Cilantro haters be warned there is a LOT of cilantro in some of their dishes I m sure this can be remedied if you order off the menu but in the buffet it couldn t really be avoided The best part of the meal was the dessert which was a shredded apple mango banana dish baked in cinnamon sugar with whipped cream on the side Overall it was just okay I might go back if I were with someone that really enjoyed the food or really wanted to give it a try But I m not sure I d return on my own 
5Db9E0Lv7fQRsjPO40RVlA CMU i ordered from here the other day for lunch im actually eating the leftovers as i write this review honestly i love americanized chinese food i mean really its not like general Gaos or tsus or whatever it is is authentic chinese anyways sometimes i crave bad for you with too much msg chinese food if thats what you want this is the place to go the beef was excellent the tofu pretty good i haven t tried the hot and sour soup that i got yet but i imagine its delicious as well then again i dont think they serve turtle or duck feet anywhere around here so no complaints from this guy i have no idea whether or not it has any but it taste magnificent 
5do4h1fz4tugc-W_Hw0fHQ CMU Delightful dinner Come quick before the crowds do Everything we ordered was yummy Staff still working out kinks rhythm 
5eGew_lyz5NrqQxGVDbjDw CMU There s a lot of fancier Chinese or Sushi places I d rate at 4 stars that I like better but they cost a lot more too For the price this is definitely a 4 star for me The sushi so far has been great I ve gotten takeout 3 times and ordered large platters each time to host groups The quality was very good better than Blue Fin worse than Fugakyu The Chinese food was surprisingly decent My favorite so far is the General Gao Tofu dish it s been a little inconsistent in how it s been cooked i e sometimes it s crispy sometimes it s soggy but it s always tasty With ambience it s not the place a young cosmopolitan couple would love or where a dude would get points for taking a girl out on a first or 20th date but for MIT type college kids or a family that just wants to get out it s perfect It s a nice place to sit down and have an unpretentious meal 
5ELlscckQHY_qlEFA2fDIw CMU Ok I LIKE the food here And consider myself pretty picky I think it beats the Royal East and possibly PuPu Hot Pot Anyway the service is always nice and very prompt and where else can you get something decent to eat by which I mean not Wendy s McDonald s or some horrific for you pizza at 2 30 am 
5fHyLnV-GYYmKnCi-lSxkg CMU First time going here My friends told me the more stairs you climb the shadier it gets So true First floor is a typical american chinese place Typical asian fried entrees but a full bar We ordered just an appetizer and drinks all around Had a scorpion bowl it was pretty good I ve had better and worse Walked upstairs to the second floor It was a bar setting and we got another scorpion bowl With cute little plastic dinosaurs thrown in Even better Walked up another flight of stairs Pretty much just a dance floor I think they served beer in the corner didn t care to check Plays top 40 s everyone had their jackets and bags thrown in one big corner Seedy crowd but perfect after those drinks 
5FN_EC-YKhlgVqc9axFNgw CMU I am not sure why everyone raves about this place it s okay but why not head over to Royal East where the Lo Mein noodles are always firm sauced tastily unlike here and the spices are not too hot I ve never had Mary s dimsum but I have tried their suan la chow shau TOO HOT and too sour royal east s is tamer and tastier dun dun noodles mushy noodles too spicy and pork with tofu strange and too spicy I do like their scallion pancakes but Royal East will make them for you if you ask and the sauce is MUCH better 
5MqmUhiYiqaznCqWysq2TA CMU I have gotten takeout here on multiple occasions and have never been disappointed The food is always really fresh and all of my Chinese friends love its authenticity What puts Yenching above its competitors coughcoughKong is the amazing service The owner who is extremely polite is always at the front and gives tea to people waiting for takeout 
5MU3UUNie-AxS4r1jbwSUQ CMU Poopoo platter is known as the Hot Plate at Yenching JSYK It consists of the following all battered and deep fried broccoli flourettes fresh green beens triangles of onion chicken fingers crab rangoons sausage wontons The lo mein noodles are known as Fried Noodles at Yenching At least they claim it s the same they aren t the same they are actually linguine noodles drenched in soy sauce delcious in my book but certainly wouldn t fly with a lo mein conneiseur The service though was absolutely excellent Much much better than most oriental restaurants I ve patronized Prices were good dinner for two was 34 and I have left overs to last me for days Not bad Yenching not bad 
5PK09UwtYGRixNyoFnRHCw CMU The atmosphere at this place is very soothing It is probably a combination of the lighting the friendly middle aged lady waitstaff and the humble color scheme There s always enough room for me to take a booth by myself and sip tea in meditation I feel welcome and secure here There s a massive menu selection Even though many of them are just permutations of meats and a vegetable side with or without spicy the variety is such that I have a hard time deciding which of my half dozen favorites I will order when I visit Sometimes the food comes so fast that you don t know how they had time to assemble the ingredients If you don t know where to start you could try the diced chicken with black bean sauce and green peppers The chicken pieces have a great texture and the peppers will make you feel proud that you ate your greens for the day 
5qgTnFsXMHt7CErSWxtsgw CMU I always feel pretty odd telling my friends about this fantastic Szechuan Chinese place Yeah uhm well its called Thailand cafe I feel sort of like I m telling my friends about a really good cure for yeast infections on the DL Really Thailand cafe serves great Chinese food Really If it makes you feel better I was mad skeptical too when a friend of a friend suggested we go there Supposedly this was a middling Thai place that a Chinese couple took it up a couple of years ago the middling Thai remained this is code for do not go here for Thai food and fantastic Szechuan cuisine was added I went here with about 6 other people one a vegetarian We got about 8 dishes and a couple of Qingdao beers ate very well and left about 20 per person The dishes were coming out of the kitchen piping hot spicy fresh out of the wok I really can t remember all of what we got a few dishes included Peking Braised eggplant 8 95 of of the variations of Whole Fish with Szechuan sauce 15 95 family style tofu 8 95 dry sauteed green beans 7 95 chili beef tendon 6 95 dan dan noodles 4 95 and more It has been a bit too long for me to really wax poetic or I m just not that talented at it on the virtues of each dish but needless to say we ate very well were very few few dishes were left wiped clean I would go and order with abandon indeed some dishes weren t _that_ noteworthy but each person has their own sense of good or bad so get what you usually like and try some new things Most importantly we left with the mark of any good Szechuan place which was a numb and tingling tongue something only accomplished with the once contraband hot and numbing Szechuan pepper corns 
5RbovUIsgf3nylDQK55pEg CMU It s a pretty good Chinese place for Harvard Square The lunch specials are a good deal I d go for the 7 25 entrees that come with rice soup and an egg roll Mmmmmmm I recommend the Yu Hsaing Garlic sauce chicken It s really good Their hot sour soup is pretty good too 
5t2I-W9_Jvl7pIzxkeXZpg CMU I miss this place My office was in Cambridge Center and has now moved to a new building with a lake in Weston we call it Gilligan s Island I was lucky enough to be in Cambridge last night and pick up dinner I ordered the Fried Rice and the Mushroom Chicken Fried Rice was typical and yummy the chicken was not too salty or mushy and the chicken was normal looking and tasting You know how you get Chinese food and look at the chicken and think What part of the chicken is THIS not here Bonus I wanted an order of Crab Rangoons and they only had 3 ready 6 make an order so they fried me up some fresh ones Yum The wonton to crabcreaminess ratio was a little off for me but still the filling was killer I have had their sushi a ton especially when dieting The prices are great and the fish is always fresh and tasty They have stuff in the case but the sushi chef is always there and will gladly make you anything you want Service is quick but still friendly 
5vRBjaAIfa_iXn4O1l1IPw CMU Very good quality Chinese food I get the impression this is the real thing I suggest trying the steamed fish but not the ginger lobster It had way more shell than actual meat 
5wC4px05DVbuDNfvZiYvEQ CMU You should know things may not go your way when there are several nationalities represented on the menu All told we received food from Beijing Tokyo and Bangkok a city not mentioned in the name unfortunately none of these cities should be proud of the representation The miso soup was good but really it s not terribly hard to make that and I like the stuff from a packet so there s that I also had the scallion pancakes which were delicious and HUGE That was quite the deal though they hardened up quickly and were nearly inedible by the end of the meal The shrimp lo mein left quite a bit to be desired mainly flavor and salt control Seriously why restaurants pass off salty browned noodles doused in in an even saltier sauce as food is beyond me The shrimp were little and a bit sad leaving me to wonder if perhaps they couldn t have ended their time on this earth instead in a packet of instant noodles Hours later and my mouth feels dry presumably since I consumed my week s worth of sodium in the lo mein not to mention whatever ungodly chemicals they added to the sauce We had a coupon for free California rolls so we got those as well In addition to being a hot rolled mess they were falling apart they were warmed by the rest of the food and this just made them even less appetizing You can get better sushi from Trader Joe s Really I did not have the pad Thai but from the looks of it it was simply a large clump of cellophane noodles with a lime The sauce came on the side as did the peanuts that part is a good idea Apparently the sauce did nothing to liven the dish up and it was tossed mainly untouched The last dish crab rangoons had water chestnuts in them which I am told is cheating basically using that as filler This place should really pick one style of Asian food and run with it The menu is a bit schizo and though they didn t eff up the order even delivered it fairly fast I wouldn t go back That is of course assuming I survive the sodium induced haze that I am currently in 
5WKphyPODEfI-VQj4ZNpYg CMU i m giving it four stars for the dun dun noodles alone 15 years after first trying them when i worked for a tech start up in the central square area i still get regular cravings for them luckily i ve a brother living in boston so a good excuse to get up that was a few times a year from new york city and we nearly always make a trip to mary chung s another thing i ve always loved is their yu hsiang eggplant but i always make sure to start off with a bowl of the dun dun noodles whatever i m getting i guess making them with egg noodles in a deviation that is a little unauthentic based on my experiences elsewhere or recipes i ve found but to me is the noodle texture and flavor i crave for this dish the best thing about the dun dun noodles though is the often insanely hot sauce which i think gets its main kick from white pepper i ve had them so hot at times that it bordered on painful but i couldn t stop eating them i like the plain version best the option with chicken doesn t really do anything for me to warrant an extra ingredient lurking in there the other food can be hit or miss order the specials if you re there either from the front of the menu or whatever their daily seasonal special is i also love the retro ambience of the place and the tea is very good too the staff are all very nice and this place is still family run with mama mary always around and her son running things up front ok i think i ve just convinced myself to plan a visit to see my brother real soon 
5XOWqfZNyOAD7LSLl5297A CMU Suan la chow show If you are at Mary s you must I repeat must get this It is a soup starter whatever you want to call it but spicy broth with delicious wontons over bean sprouts It s a party in a bowl Then make way for dumplings as they say The small steamed buns are fantastic and come with a great ginger sauce to accompany it If you are ordering scallion pie or the peking ravioli it comes with a spicy sauce ask for hot oil and mix some in generously then dip away Thank me later You may gain a few pounds here but you may also sweat it out haha Mongolian beef is also top notch and the dun dun noodles are great although I always forget to order them myself I order the same thing all the time so this review is pretty much based on only 5 6 items If you are looking for more americanized chinese food or super authentic dim sum this is not the spot Mary is usually here and when she has an apron on you know you re in for a treat Very friendly staff and great eats on the cheap Can t beat that 
618g3j-vkK1SBfoNcNoJHA CMU It s really americanized but perfect for large groups The food is still tasty too 
640p8y9gSs-sui0vfZQkAQ CMU Ignore the name This place does not do Thai food well What you come here for is authentic Sichuan cuisine So hard to find in Boston but when I did wow A fat and happy kitten I was The standouts were the cumin beef and eggplant with garlic sauce All were extra spicy just like I like it and packed with flavor The lowlight of the evening was my default Chinese food dish kung pao chicken Yes it was spicy but what that translated to was unflavored chicken with lots of red peppers piled on top Still better than every other not even remotely spicy kung pao I ve tried in Boston but certainly not worth writing home about Any negative review of this place will criticize it for failing to deliver delicious Thai food and Americanized Chinese food Look at the menu Notice how it s in Chinese not Thai The owners are Chinese Therefore the Chinese food is the only thing worth eating here If you re used to east coast Chinese food perhaps you will disagree but being from California Sichuan is the Chinese I m used to and the only kind that tickles my taste buds Five stars to counteract the unfair reviews of ZOMG THE THAI FOOD SUCKS 11 
66eFfPA7Oo-gx9xiTX1QNQ CMU Went here with some friends and we had fun despite the place but this place is really about the scorpian bowls and dancing to bad music I saw a bachelorette party and thought yup its that kinda place The drinks are cheap though Didn t eat anything and can t imagine I would 
6aNb6HoA94y_YoGkZTsq8A CMU I ve been eating here for years the best Chinese restaurant in town Order the scallion pie salt pepper porkchop pork and string beans also pork or beef lo mein and fried rice order it dark and spicy It can be very spicy so if you ate a lightweight order just dark Beef and tomato is also great There ate 20 other great items on the menu but these are the most popular items we order 
6BZFhXnAYPk2xU5dBsbupA CMU I was dressed up to go out dancing and walked by the crazy line for this place my first thought why is there a line for a chinese restaurant second thought why are those people dressed up in 80 s gear Apparantly it was a dress up night first bar was packed and one level up was a dance club also packed lots of drunk and crazy party people A little bit of a dive barish place but a lot of fun people going crazy 
6CCgMeZyabt1SwtIzw_5UQ CMU This place is bar crawl central We had the Yelp Politely Elevated Bar Tour a lesbian bar crawl and a bachelorette party all on the same night Get your Scorpion Bowls here However depending on which bartender you go to you either get animals in your scorpion bowl or you dont If that is not enough bartenders playing god with animals the music is controlled by the bartenders using two ipods and a mixer That explains why it is soooo cheesy Hong Kong has it s place in the world It s a stone s throw from passed out in the gutter and a plastic animal away from the looney bin 
6E6-1XOGaUyy9hk1Bf6KNQ CMU The eggplant with garlic is so good here 
6eWahbCxmkkkx4p83WdEew CMU This place is usually great but sometimes they are a little off They have a new cook in the kitchen and he likes to use a lot of pepper I m not anti spicy buuuuuut he s not using the appropriate spice and sometimes he just overdoes it Other than that the food is great I love their wonton soup especially when they have shrimp wontons Their scallion pancake is deliciously greasy and yummy at the same time A lot of the main dishes that I ve tried are good as well such as the Beef with mushrooms and bamboo shoots eggplant with shredded chicken and moo shoo pork The dishes that disappointed me were moo goo gai pan which is usually in a white sauce this one is just steamed with no flavor and is GROSS The general gaus chicken is ok but has the pepper problem Overall this is the place to get decent chinese in Central Square 
6F-r_fihZoUDI3N5PBvtrg CMU Amatuer comedy night free fun beers aren t too pricey Bar scene okay kinda lame scorpion bowls are fun but difficult to drink when standing around the top floor with the club vibe lame Harvard kids on E Though there was a girl fight when we were there which was simultaneously scary amusing This one girl showed off a fist full of hair she d pulled from another girl s head I guess there s a lack of places to go out dance in the square but I think it s worth the trip somewhere else 
6HAzYM-sfFWrL6XHU6r3vA CMU Tried the groupon 6 for 9 today I thought it was a big cheating phenomenon This does not mean that the buffet is for 6 They then tell you that the buffet is 10 and you have to pay 1 extra so what they advertise on Yelp is 100 lies Now about the food There were 5 6 items on buffet of which only haka noodles were good everything else was soggy and uninviting At the end our waiter asked us for ice cream and got us Mango ice cream which saved the day She was nice and very attentive and so the 2 stars are one for her and the other for Mango IC Otherwise I will not return for food here I felt cheated 
6HHRFEx8E8hEpGjT1s7ggg CMU Went here last night because I had bought a CoupMe coupon before checking out the reviews sigh The momos were decent and so was the Chicken 65 I do agree that the chicken tasted a bit strange too fatty perhaps The hakka noodles and calcutta chicken were very average The worst thing was how the waitress described Indian Chinese to a couple Its Chinese food with Indian spices good Indian Chinese is so much more Mumbai Chopstix you have a great location and a beautiful restaurant you can do better than this 
6hhX8Te2T7vBAxFwt-lVIQ CMU Due to the convenience of the location I have tried the majority of dishes available here With the exception of the pad thai all were pretty mediocre The pad thai was not very good and tasted nothing like I would expect pad thai to taste I only made the mistake of dining at the restaurant once and was met with very poor service If I return it will be only for pick up or delivery 
6hx-l6I_h3x2jnjBcVhEGQ CMU Most people I know like it here but I am not that much of a fan I think the meats are not the best of quality and that is very important to me You may like it though it s cheap and you do get what you pay for 
6HxXmgzXpNG7ZWgu25-lLA CMU I ve read several reviews questioning Pu Pu Hot Pot as fit for human consumption but with my experience I m attributing this to a poofs exaggeration Staff are courteous and delivery was expedient The food was VERY greasy It was too greasy for my tastes but it was delivered pipping hot which is more than I can say for some of my other delivery experiences When I bit into my egg roll a bit of grease dribbled down my face and I understood why everyone I knows said Pu Pu is the king of greasy Chinese Being the unpretentious foody I am this didn t really phase me however the blah taste of a too lightly salted orange dipping sauce was irksome Same goes for the not so sweet and not so sour chicken It all kind of reminded me of the Chinese food you would find in a Kansas City mall s food court 
6IZ8oEMxKQUF7e8D22DyRA CMU Overrated but passable Thailand Cafe is quite obviously run by a Chinese family the food lacks the most distinctive qualities of real great Thai food but then so does most other Thai in Boston They make up for it with low prices fresh taste fast service and a convenient location wrt MIT 
6jUJd_E5zu7e0qGb8xA6RA CMU Mmmmm tasty When they say spicy they mean spicy So much so that I am often cursing my mid atlantic whitey upbringing as I try to get one or two more chopsticks full of delicious Dun Dun noodles into my mouth before my tongue spontaneously ignites Cream cheese from some of the tastiest crab rangoons I ve ever had and the pitcher of ice water they leave at the table helps temper the spice but tread cautiously I almost never branch out from the Dun Dun s no chicken please because the spicy peanutty goodness is so amazing but I had some twice cooked spicy pork today that was damned tasty Good hot and sour soup chock full of goodies nice greasy spring rolls and beer balance out the mix and best of all the place is cheap Dun dun comes in at 5 50 for two meals worth and most entrees are less than 8 Definitely a Central Square staple Just don t try to go on Tuesday s cause they re closed and bring cash no plastic taken here 
6mtUIDDYsgfzp4gelmYn7w CMU Ah The Kong you ve gone through so many different changes I love you and hate you at the same time On the one end their food is delectable particularly during an evening of drunken revelry Basically it s greasy Chinese food Of particular note are the scallion pancakes which are fried doughy happiness The Scorpion Bowls are also quite good though as in any scorpion bowl situation you need to not drink too many of these things as they will screw with you to no end Regular beers are standard priced for the area They ve also done a decent job with the redesign with nicer chairs and booths on the second floor as opposed to their previous design with the newer design attempting to give a more cool club motif My one issue with The Hong Kong is in its event planning I m not going to get into full specifics here if you re interested message me but the communication with whoever was running the event was lacking greatly Beyond that issue though you know what you re getting with the Hong Kong It s better than its Fanueil brethren but it s a college bar If that s what you re looking for that will be what you get Also good Scorpion Bowls 
6nOJGmO6Lb5f-SiDNcvhNw CMU This place deserves three stars but I m giving it four because it compares favorably to the other Chinese restaurants in Harvard Square The decor is Spartan but the restaurant is clean The food at the buffect looks weathered but the entrees off of the menu are good New Asia does have brown rice Also their dietetic options are excellent I especially recommend their steamed chicken with ginger and scallions 
6pM5MfV2geuzqAquqn9r4Q CMU So even though I ve given this place two stars it is probably one of the restaurants I most frequented when I lived in the Boston area It took me a long time to realize that this place was crummy I guess the price was that good Oh yeah and they ve often served me my food within 2 minutes of ordering I guess that should have been a warning sign Instead my hungry college self was quite satisfied by nearly instantaneous gratification oh how times have changed 
6T7x398mCEPsv0q7sGMkeQ CMU Really didn t like the chicken broccoli or the eggplant dish here and I love eggplant The only reason this place is getting their 3 stars from me is because I really like the dun dun noodles with chicken It s pretty spicy which is a plus for me and fairly cheap 
6YslD_Qd_AJE3GNTYzMkzg CMU Great selection of Chinese food I always overeat when I go Experience Mary and her husband is very nice and accommodating The wait staff is hit or miss There s an older lady who is super friendly and attentive sorry don t remember her name but there are others who have an attitude Food They have a great selection of Americanized Chinese and more traditional dishes Which is great when I have a mix group of friends with me They also have a weekend menu I think it s their dim sum version but I can t remember I know on weekends they offer pig s feet love it I recommend the following dishes btw I love spicy dishes 1 Yushiang eggplant 2 Shuan lau cha show spicy wontons 3 Chicken velvet with straw mushrooms not spicy 4 Ma Po tofu 5 Beef with black mushrooms and bamboo shoots Overall Great food for cheap 
75H92zg2sGEeClrY649Hrg CMU I ve had consistently good experiences at Yenching over the years in terms of food and service and the atmosphere while nothing to write home about is good for what this place is a low key Chinese restaurant The head waitress apparently has a good memory because she always remembers what I like to order pineapple chicken it may be bright pink but it s sooo good This is a good place to check out if you re near Harvard and it s definitely nicer than the Hong Kong restaurant the Kong down the street 
79rSwhxTYxvUmG9X4bPrkw CMU Came back for the 7 95 lunch special Food was plentiful and good especially the chicken in garlic sauce I was less of a fan of the hunan chicken 
7D8-g3CKI75_TgUjOdKTug CMU We were anxious to try Mumbai Chopstix and grabbed the coupon on Eversave for the unique Indo Chinese restaurant It s an interesting concept and we both love Indian as well as Chinese cuisine The ambiance is nice inside It s cozy and comfortable with both Chinese and Indian d cor sometimes at the sametime We were seated immediately Service started out just fine and I ordered a glass of a Shiraz blend but I had to send it back because it had turned I never send wine back but this did not taste right They swapped it with a glass of Pinot Noir without any question We then ordered the Tandoori Vegetable Spring rolls the Hawker style Hot Garlic Chicken the Calcutta Szechuan Shrimp and the Szechwan style mushroom fried rice The spring rolls came out and they were delicious It really was a perfect blend of Indian and Chinese tastes They are in wedges rather than the traditional rolls which looks nice but you don t get as much of the veggies in a bite Our meals came and this where things started to crumble The Garlic chicken was very good no problems there the Szechuan shrimp that we ordered was given to us as the Szechuan chicken the fried rice which is described as Really spicy mixed meat fried rice with cilantro and mushrooms wasn t all that spicy and the we were led to believe there was meat in the rice but there wasn t I guess meat fried rice does not mean meat will be served with the rice The Szechuan Chicken was really good so we didn t send it back but I do wish there was shrimp in it Meanwhile I have run out of water and we both have finished our drink The waiter was nowhere to be found and when he did come back he didn t ask if we wanted another drink The service all around was just so so and while I thought the food was good but I don t anticipate us going back I would maybe recommend it to someone who really wants to try it but be very specific about what you want and be prepared for confusion 
7gTNJE_W45GduVXQ2zm-1A CMU Sucks 
7IreAwtkmehVX3tZLXW_aA CMU I wanted to love this place because it has a decent menu at decent prices and it was so close to home Unfortunately it was just okay I ordered the peppered toro appetizer and the sushi and sashimi combo The bf had the chicken and beef teriyaki The serving of peppered toro sashimi was a lot more than what I expected 8 pieces but was a little to peppery for my taste Toro was of decent quality The sushi and sashimi combo was pretty disappointing though The sashimi was all too chewy and the sushi just wasn t that fresh I was almost going to reach across to the next table and grab their big bowl of soba noodles cuz it looked so much tastier than my sushi The bf enjoyed the beef and chicken teriyaki The portions were decent sized and had a great meat to veggie ratio with he appreciated We did wish that they served some good Japanese beer to go along with the food Overall it was a decent meal at a decent price If you re in the neighborhood and want some Japanese Chinese food this is a good option I would recommend staying away from the sashimi and only ordering a couple orders of sushi rather than trying to make it your meal 
7K2r8RQ7g7QSIwYMx2croA CMU Food is both really oily and not that great 
7LnSUXUYcyJCUHCti2ZeBw CMU Suan la chow show Repeat this over and over on the way to Mary s and say it as soon as the wait person arrives Dumpling hounds only Try the soup that features these Other favs Dan dan noodles Szechuan Pickles and Pork Soup Peking Special Sauce Noodles Tzar Cheung Mein Yu Hsiang Eggplant Brunch on Sunday was ritual for years with me and the mates Don t order American chinese food or lunch combos here Do try the banquets fixed price inclusive meals C mon at least one person you know can read speak chinese it s the PRC after all 
7L_D65aHIXK-JQfGYHN-fw CMU Delicious Thai food best ever for the price They have a great vegetarian selection and will make almost anything vegetarian if you ask them The wait staff is attentive and we ve never had to wait more than 10 minutes for our food to come out of the kitchen I love their Thai sticks veggie tempura style appetizer and their tofu triangles are hot and fresh I miss this place so much 
7MlyhBQQZRnU3Y2i5Zl-vg CMU I took the bf to Mary Chung s for Dim Sum on a Sunday morning based on Yelp reviews raving about it We didn t have a horrible experience but I didn t really think it lived up to the hype Disclaimer I am not a dim sum expert Also I was hungover Selection was limited and the deep fry was inescapable The food was pretty tasty but given that it was all encased in a half inch of deep fried dough it was hard to tell dishes apart after the first bite Unlike a bigger Chinatown restaurant you had to order piecemeal and couldn t see things going about on little trays and try to spot the green stuff We tried the peking ravioli the steamed buns the scallion pancake and the sesame balls based on Yelper recommendations The sesame balls were exceptional but more of something you d like a taste of for dessert so sweet and the rest of it sort of ran together in an endless carbohydrate cloud We kept ordering more and more hoping for that excellent thing but it didn t arrive Usually hungover me loves fried food but not this time I m still willing to give Mary Chung s another try sometime for dinner But honestly with Mulan nearby that is unlikely to be soon 
7mzo8uYToyTkdl4kpAsgiQ CMU Great food great service everything was so delicious can t wait to go back 
7q0xssGd1GsRDBNeH9YhLg CMU Hate to say this but it was a fail for me The food was way overpriced and not very good My entree had good heat but nothing else beyond that My companion asked for mild and got bland I gave two stars because I thought the decor inside on the second floor was interesting and our server was okay 
7R3vuLFwpT-q677wHvq-9Q CMU I love Hong Kong Its trashy fabulous diverse crowd get ya crunk Scorpion Bowls and bumping occasionally hilarious hip hop add up to a great time The only dance floor in the city where I ve been hit on by dudes reppin the Ivy League and the Ivory Coast in the same night Go here with your girls get wasted and dance your little butt off without pretension 
7rd35Rd5PhbpuYIQwad-Gw CMU Ordered for delivery yesterday I thought it was pretty good Everything tasted good especially the appetizer We will be ordering from this restaurant again My only complaint is that my chicken with cashew nuts had vegetables especially celery YUCK 
7t48-9CHXmLBDhg-DmQlew CMU Yenching has great service especially considering it s in Harvard Square very friendly staff Their prices are reasonable their food is good and their service is fast Their shrimp fried rice is very good not sure what they do differently but it s not as heavy feeling as other shrimp fried rice I ve tried Their lunch combos are also very good deals 
7WgXRn5vDQh6_nhzPHvXPw CMU The meal I crave most is Dun Dun Noodles and Suan La Chow Show I ve been going to Mary s since the 80 s and it still tastes the same every time On most days you will find Mary walking through the dining room greeting customers As Patrick B said you should come here for the food You won t regret it Large portions of good food for a reasonable price They do tend to make things on the spicy side but are very accomodating if you need to tone it down Just let them know if you like your food on the milder side or without msg 
7WNBQa_on4E0KNeR_e7scA CMU I love Chinese food I really do I ve spent a lot of time in Asia and Oceania and there are a lot of Chinese around that part of the world Which means I got to indulge my love of Chinese food a lot I had been to Yenching before and thought it was ok but wasn t in a rush to go back Tonight I had a massive craving for Chinese and this was the only reasonable option within walking distance It s not good It s really not It s greasy the dishes lack any delicacy and the feeling afterwards of it all sinking to the pit of my stomach suggests that there may have been an aggressive use of MSG The wait staff are friendly and they re mainland Chinese Unfortunately there s a critical ingredient missing a decent chef 
7xM2OKlWViToLW7OLmDd3w CMU The biggest mistake I made was to buy the groupon deal to this restaurant without checking yelp reviews We went there in the afternoon about 2 30 ish I ordered a soup and chicken chilli and my wife ordered chicken 65 and vegetable fried rice The soup was not hot when they served chicken chilly tasted no where near the one you get in India s Chinese restaurants Chicken 65 and rice was OK The service was not good While we were eating another party of 4 people walked in and asked about their lunch buffet There was another half an hour for the buffet to close but the waiter said they will not add any more food to buffet and they have to eat whatever is left I was surprised that the party decided to have their meal in this restaurant after what they heard I would strongly recommend my fellow yelpers to avoid this restaurant 
7yXyj0AxgsBgEY5g0aPbAw CMU This is an ok lunch spot for Harvard Square though I did leave feeling a little hungry One of my colleagues had raved about this place Interesting hot pot concept nothing like it in Harvard Square Trendy looking place Unfortunately the portions are really small so unless you share an extra portion with someone you ll likely be unsatisfied 
8B01VqNKMIkYv9Rzt_-Zqw CMU only tried the hot sour soup it gets 5 stars until someone can tell me a better place to get it read the bad reviews so many of them BUT the hot sour soup is very very good that s what i was looking for and that s what i liked ekb 
8IM-PBO5kCFn9YOFkbs6PQ CMU um today s experience was bad but I ve been before and it s okay Fairly standard nothing to write home about 
8j-AebXyv8iluBjjqUzFqw CMU First and foremost it is not a hot pot restaurant I tried it looking for Chinese hot pot but such places are quite rare Other than that right on with some other reviews not authentic but cheap and tasty 
8Lb8Q2eLUwXnWdCPcYotFA CMU One of my friend really wanted to me try it The taste of the foods are pretty strong No wonder many people like it For my own preference I rather have lighter sauce so I can have the real taste of the food I would say the food are well prepared and cooked but it can be better For people who like stronger taste You should try it 
8LClVpN6QzkprGQhsCD8FA CMU Great place They are supposed to be famous for Chinese Sichuan spicy meals but they ve also got normal nice food It s quite cheap for groups We ordered about ten dishes and the average was only 16 pp including tax and tips And the food quality was quite good 
8lSR0AEaQPiHQSyfxaaRRw CMU All of the food at Yenching is really solid It s pretty standard Chinese but you really can t go wrong My staples are the pineapple chicken curry chicken sweet and sour chicken kung pao chicken I like chicken but really everythings good I always get shrimp fried rice too although their fried rice could be a bit better My favorite part about the restaurant is that they are very quick about filling up my water cup I know it sounds silly but I drink a lot very quickly and it s really awesome to always have a full cup of water Most people probably don t care I suppose All of the workers are very nice as well My only beef is that I think they don t give me all of my food in my doggy bag I always have a BIG pile of fried rice left and they only give me a small box of it I ve never actually measured so I can t confirm this and it s probably just my imagination 
8MoFVZ9tJ34vIhCnTsVxSg CMU I am not normally a food reviewer but felt compelled to review Yenching As someone who frequents China and has a good idea of what good Chinese food like I have to say that Yenching comes much closer than usual to hearty relatively authentic Chinese food A few dishes to note are the mei cai kou rou which is a slow cooked pork belly and the si chuan hui guo rou a spicy pork belly stir fry It is a Chinese restaurant so one would expect the pork to stand out Vegetables are good too in particular the gan bian si ji dou In addition to the food the service is excellent as is the attitude of the employees Finally being in the center of Harvard yard makes it really convenient for us students 
8mSY98peCMoPaHcUhfeo9A CMU Pu Pu serves up pretty good American style Chinese food I wouldn t pay more than the cost of the 5 lunch special for this food which is heavy on the MSG and soy sauce esp the fried rice which was more like doused with soy sauce but sometimes I get a craving for unsophisticated 1970 s style Chinese food and Pu Pu Hot Pot delivers in that regard Note that it would be nearly impossible for me to give this style of food a five star rating so a three star rating here is an endorsement given the above caveats 
8PB7pshC5wZo4eqvg5EOTg CMU Not a good place to get food Infact this place falls within the range of worst to bad Quantity and quality both are bad 
8QaFXLnEQJz1ryFCtCuj1g CMU Don t go to Hong Kong Harvard Square for the food It s really not very good DO go for the tasty scorpian bowls with the plastic animals that float on your fruit I mean really Who doesn t love a scorpian bowl and you can t beat the plastic animals 
8Rs5LCW17v9t-mOzSagKBg CMU I think the last time I came here with a friend and they tried to order the Thai food I screamed and slapped their hand No NO DON T DO IT For the longest time my only impression of this place was that it served up the nastiest pad thai I had ever had It was so uninspiring I didn t eat for 2 days But then somehow they started serving Szechuan food Really good Szechuan food You can tell because whenever you go in now the place is packed with Chinese grad students from MIT Those guys know what s up Also you can tell because there are untranslated wall specials in Chinese Bring someone who knows what s up or ask a Chinese grad student for help P My favorites are the shui zhu yu and the shui zhu niu something like spicy braised fish spicy braised beef they are phenomenally tender and inauthentically delightfully spicy but not spicy enough to give me an aneurism If you re here on your own or for lunch the spicy beef noodle soup is very acceptable and comes with healthy pieces of bok choy Oh and if you must grab something off the Thai menu make it the totally acceptable Thai Iced Tea Anything else and you re at risk of getting slapped by me 
8xAVPTViM21ZzQ0H3E8sfA CMU The average rating 2 1 2 stars is about right I ll give it 3 but I don t really disagree with the 1 and 2 star ratings If you re hungry this place might meet your needs The food quality ranges from OK to sub standard Vegetarians should probably not even consider it The one time I stopped by at dinner hours the portions were large and fresh albeit bland which is not always the case with the buffet i e the freshness I wish this place were better because for me it s in a great location on the Central side of Harvard Square 
9394IgT5CZMpm-PS_MEaQw CMU This is not a first date want to impress someone kinda place It s not fancy but it does have some unique hole in the wall charm to it It s cheap decent service very tasty very spicy food I always get the spicy soup which is their speciality but it really is more of a dish than a soup I ve tried many dishes and they were all good Not everything is spicy but the spicy things are really spicy which i love They only take cash so stop by the ATM first I would bring my kids here but I haven t yet 
93UHYWHwGCfQnZ14W1-opw CMU A OK sushi for decent prices in the middle of Cambridge You can order by phone or foodler an ordering service linked on their website then run over and pick it up or get it delivered for a fee I highly recommend this as one person in our party didn t order ahead and it seemed like it took forever for their food to be prepared Very few people just one table were eating inside the restaurant while we were there picking up The sweet potato had eel sauce on it yum can t get enough of that Spicy tuna was just a tad spicy and the tuna wasn t the freshest but I didn t get sick or die Hooray Choosing a vegetable and a fish roll put me at 10 for lunch Besides sushi they also have other Japanese and Chinese food Other reviewers don t seem to think this is the place to get Thai food which apparently is on the menu but I didn t even see Their Chinese lunch specials are cheaper that sushi sorry for being captain obvious here so I ll give that a try next time 
9CuOfSBIXvQ-VzzWyNByTA CMU Here s the trick always order the specials that are on the board and you ll get the freshest best stuff Amazing whole steamed fish usually they have a grey sole with garlic and scallions great veggie dishes pea tendrils and baby bok choy are amazing that are healthy and tasty Yes the common things Americans order at Chinese restaurants are available like general Gau s chicken but why bother The stuff on the board is always soo much better Great scallion pancakes and dumplings There is always room no waiting good for large parties You can even pre arrange a menu with the owner if you are having a large group come in and he ll tell you what fresh ingredients he can have for you on a particular date Friendly staff they accept credit cards and the prices are very reasonable My favorite Chinese food in Cambridge 
9ecngbykfvtDikF8ogxTkw CMU Good and cheap Chinese food right at MIT s backyard The lunch specials are simply amazing If it weren t such a walk from campus I would totally be coming here all the time 
9J54W6aEfYasWqSWF3qpDA CMU Beijing Tokyo hint of Seoul offers Chinese Japanese and one Korean dish Go figure It s not a fancy place but it has plenty of seating and the sushi bar s in the back They have one TV The guy making the sushi was watching basketball even though there was a Red Sox game on tev Comparable prices and a large menu SERVICE Anyway service was odd Me and my gal pal were carefully studying the menu but the waitress drunk kept asking us if we were ready This occurred three times in a period of 1 5 minutes Whoa Then of course when we were ready to leave no one came with our check Oh me oh my In fact our waitress just hunkered down with a huge bowl of noodle soup for her own dinner even after a solid ten minutes of our waiting FOOD We ordered a couple maki roll dishes crazy roll with tempura sauce and some mild tuna avocado roll I was VERY pleased with both Big fat rolls nice sized chunks of raw fishies there s not much more to ask The small wonton soup came fairly loaded with wontons for only 2 but the steamed dumplings had the thick dough which I m not the biggest fan of After 28 I was satisfyingly filled Bonus Miracle is close by for an after dinner drink and their big window is now OPEN 
9jpZXvcQn2X15Gj7xijgZg CMU First and foremost this restaurant has terrible service They basically ignore you at length are reluctant to come take your order and seem upset anytime you ask them for something This is NOT a place to go eat unless you like getting ignored The other point is DON T EAT THE THAI FOOD Their Sichuan menu is the true gem of the restaurant Their typical Sichuan appetizers like the Beef Tendon or Tripe in Chili Vinaigrette are delicious and their servings aren t skimpy Get one or two of these if visiting with friends Their fish in chili pastes and stuff are the focus of the meal I ve found their pork dishes to be a little skimpy and small on the meet I d stick with Eggplant and Fish on my visits This is a frequent takeout destination for me Very easy and cheap to order a dish or two and pick it up and share it with friends A great destination for students nearby They have some lunch specials for 6 7 dollars but these aren t much to rave about and consist of their less good dinner options 
9KIPXfx757As4CFAh1EZVg CMU Compared to the other Chinese restaurants in Cambridge this one is probably the better choice The food is mandarin cuisine and not as greasy as Hong Kong but the prices are about the same a bit overpriced for the type of dish The noodles are good but can be sometimes a bit too salty Their sweet and sour pork is decent and fried rice is ok although sometimes not always the rice was probably cooked with too much water 
9kVUBhpcTypyGI7V648lfQ CMU We ordered a bunch of apps and watched Dog the Bounty Hunter Let s review Yay Mmmm Shanghai Kofu appetizer what poplers would be if they existed and weren t living creatures so yummy Suan La Chow Show is a huge meal sized app for under 6 quick delivery filled 2 of us up for under 20 with tip Boo Veggie Wonton soup was lame the MSG from boyfriend s Hot Sour soup stunk up the apt this came out of a box him on eating soup Meh sauce on Suan La Chow Show app was peanut butter and sesame seeds boo for quality yay for taste i guess 
9MmiL-znJYqQB1HrIELVDw CMU The chai my friend got was 6 That s absurd We had the lunch buffet which was so so I liked the noodles and the rice The rest was just mediocre The mango ice cream for dessert was good I was expecting more Indian flavors than Chinese flavors The wait staff was friendly and attentive 
9mNuP03trpA1ap2WeSKZ9A CMU 5 stars because the owner REALLY cares He will look at the color of your tea and without a word will have a waiter bring you better tea Yes it s what Americans want to eat and I m an American I go for lunch all the time You will not find a bigger and better lunch selection for the price than at Royal East This place is a bargain and the lunch crowd speaks for itself Personal service good food and great prices 2 of us will have soup and a main dish I like the chicken with baby bok choy with rice and maybe an eggroll All for 12 For 2 people 
9ocQ1wKc7Z1T1-h7rzeD4Q CMU Nothing wrong with this place It s a pretty typical Chinese restaurant The food is decent but probably not too authentic 
9OEX13n8KZ2pCAYQlhoBiA CMU An awesome place for some authentic Chinese food with a good price around Boston area just look at how many Chinese people are there mostly from MIT We ve tried lots of times in restaurant and delivery The delivery guy sometimes asks for more tips but I offer 10 for most of the times They charge for delivery fee so 10 is good enough 
9Q6oo_OOJAvZ2QkN-UADmQ CMU This place is ok I ve eaten there numerous times and thought it was not particularly great for vegetarians until I realized you could ask them to make anything you want and they will do it So I normally ask for some kind of spicey dish with fried tofu and string beans Still not my favorite though They do have an interesting selection of chinese greens though For some reason its a favorite of many professors I had at MIT 
9t5tVkDQ2O6fHYNaH7-MZQ CMU Look you take this place for what it is Somehwere to get f ed up off of scorpion bowls and drink beers out of a plastic cup as you watch some hardcore gully gangstas yo mix with Harvard students mix with townies mix with ugly Wellesely girls looking to get their MRS degrees GO have a 12 martini somewhere trendy if that is your scene and stay the hell away from here This place is ill son Holla at me 
9tHVRFK1ftd9gjZWu-SqTg CMU For mediocre Thai food come here For Chinese Szechuan food it s not bad given the close proximity to the MIT campus come here The lunch menu is a better deal price wise but the Chinese lunch menu only available on weekdays not weekends Only the badly made Thai food as a lunch menu on weekends A complimentary bowl of soup accompanies the lunch menu dishes The service here is lackluster and inattentive If you truly believe that the entire dining experience ie tasty food good atmosphere decent service cleanliness is a must then I would avoid this place 
9T_iY0biUUeaO0_z0reYhQ CMU I love to eat here and all my friends love it too I ve been going here for a decade and I always dine in I have eaten there probably a hundred times The food is delicious and the portions are huge despite the low price The service is always friendly My favorite disch is the Szechuan Shredded Beef they prepare this in a unique way that has me ordering this again and again They have a lot of other very craveable dishes as well They are very busy with takeout on the weekends but I have always been able to get a table in the small restaurant The food is satisfying cheap and incredibly tasty what more could you ask for 
9XfLamii2MnpdpUY7NP3xw CMU I ve given this place a few chances and I ve been disappointed every time If you re a Thai place and can t make a decent pad thai dish then you re doing something wrong 
9z-VPPpfQHPtGBOojmV_nQ CMU One of my friends liked dining here but I m not a huge fan The lunch boxes are reasonably priced but the food is kind of bland The waitstaff are pretty nice but the manager owner can be overly friendly and not in a sincere way Very convenient Harvard Square locale but even that can t get me back in the door 
a3epHHA3NFlVH4NPQ6QkTQ CMU Thailand Cafe is beloved by MIT students for being cheap and tasty It has pretty good vegetarian options and is great place to go for a quick lunch Try the scallion pancakes ooh and they have Ginger Ale and this weird toothpick dispenser that is essentially a plastic bird serving you a wooden stick not the best thai in cambridge by a long shot but the most convenient for a quick bite if you are at MIT 
a3IBDBxkBT4FwH67w4AKBQ CMU I had come here to eat with a group of girlfriends when it first opened and absolutely loved the food and the decor After spending years in Asia Mumbai Chopstix reminded me of the flavors of Singapore and Malaysia it was such as refreshing change from the normal Chinese or Indian cuisine in town I was disturbed by the recent negative reviews but decided to check it out again because of a Groupon deal We dined at Mumbai Chopstix last Friday night and found the service to be friendly and efficient They were aware of the negative reviews and were making positive changes My husband who had never eaten here before and is ever afraid of dining risk was pleasantly surprised He really enjoyed the drums of heaven so much that he licked the wing clean We enjoyed the samosas and tandoori chicken spring rolls We ordered the tilapia dish which was tasty but our only complaint was that there was too much sauce covering the fish having said that my husband literally cleaned out the sauce with the rice The entree prices are a little on the high side but this is Newbury Street We d definitely come again 
a4FOMWOb_aDtO8NEvajDOg CMU Mary Chung s I love you You make me fat and I don t care I was a chef in Boston at one of the top restaurants in Boston and one guy would bring these in a few times a month I love him It was the best day ever We all loved them and the kitchen would stop if even for 30 seconds while we enjoyed them One day he brought in two full trays That was the best day ever Go just go AMAZING FOOD Great for lunch or dinner I just moved to Cambridge and I have had Mary Chung s about 7 times in the month I have lived here For lunch I recommend suan la chow show Yummy steamed boiled Pork dumplings with a delicious hot and spicy sauce on a bed of fresh bean sprouts So good perfect size for lunch and only 4 50 For dinner Same as above also scallion pancakes the BEST I have ever had thick crispy on the outside with light flaky chewy layers on the inside You will never look as a scallion pancake the same way again Served with the same spicy hot sauce on the dumplings Also I had the dun dun noodles with chicken Super hot and spicy We also had a lion s head meat ball which is a HUGE meatball bigger than a softball in a broth with cabbage I wasn t a huge fan don t eat a lot of meat but my boyfriend who is a huge carnivore loved it I recommend you go now however if you are trying to loose weight don t go because you will eat it for the next 2 weeks Also if you don t do spicy you are weird and also don t go because you might not be able to handle the food Excellent excellent excellent Saves me from making the trip down to Chinatown MAKE SURE YOU BRING CASH AS THEY DON T ACCEPT CARDS Everything is super cheap They also have really cute shirts that say Make way for dumplings 
aaAR93vLR8gTiTp2bcUjcw CMU I ve never been to the Hong Kong for food so I can t speak to that which is maybe a good thing but for drinks and dancing I have yet to find a place I enjoy more Which is not to say the Hong Kong is the best in any category one might judge drinking or dancing establishments Except for maybe one quantity of plastic animals in scorpion bowls If you ve been looking for somewhere to get a neon orange miniature giraffe this is your place Also if you ve been looking for a place to get sloppy drunk and sloppily dance with a bunch of people who couldn t be bothered to pretend to not be quite as sloppy as they are this is your place If you re looking for classy drinks a DJ who knows his shit well dressed 20 something professionals a velvet rope or someone who didn t just card you at the door because although you re clearly over 21 he gets so many undergrads that he just has to check this probably isn t the place for you I go because the vertically integrated night life requires no pretension or high expectations and sometimes all you really want to do is chug a scorpion bowl with a couple of friends and make some bad decisions 
aAJu07_FbJsYCG_ujb1HgA CMU The Kong serves its late night purpose and I ve found two redeeming dishes here one for each star I have begrudged it They make a decent sorry only know the Chinese name it s like flat noodles and beef and some vegetables But that s only because it is meant to be oily and therefore the Kong s one method of cooking by steeping everything in oil suffices They also make a delightfully oily crab rangoon appetizer Beware the pinch of this crispy faux crustacean the flaky dryness is not for the faint of heart but once you tame the crust and claws the rich inner feeling will leave you sated and wanting for more saturated cream I have tried a few things here and there but the Pupu Platter probably characterizes the majority of Kong food accurately The crab rangoons are of course tasty but the ribs are as toxic as the bright magenta insinuates tasting like last night s leftovers as your teeth sink into the flacid pork flesh 
aatMwsq16rlk2ilFK_jzQQ CMU I really liked this place It s perched atop the new Wagamama for a moment we considered going there out of laziness as I know the Wag well but I m glad we didn t because I don t think the food or experience would have been as good The decor is elegant without being pretentious I felt relaxed and comfortable Our waiter was quite nice and helpful with questions I had I ended up sharing the Achi salad pickled veggies with a peanut and sesame sauce spicy and having the Sambal entree with a CBC brewed Tiger Bite beer with lemongrass and Kaffir lime My boyfriend got the Mixed Veg with Tofu dish All of it was tasty The salad was a bit too spicy for me but I still enjoyed eating what I could before my mouth caught on fire The Sambal was nice not a very inventive dish but I still liked it The tofu was my favorite though Very nice consistency and the sauce was flavorful and worked well with the tofu and the veggies I m surprised at the reviews that Rendang was too expensive because I found it to be pretty reasonable and not outrageous Dinner for two with entrees rice salad shared and beer was 35 There wasn t a huge amount of food and we didn t have any leftovers worth taking home so maybe that s why 
Aaty1ZfevshlmpYYkd_xbA CMU I recently changed my rating from five to four stars because I went back and had some different menu items that were not quite as good I think my five star rating might also have been a result of my server s totally hot ass Nonetheless my original review below is still appropriate My roommate and I wandered into this place when Cambridge Brewing was overflowing with people and we had a movie to catch in an hour What an experience Completely refreshing menu sorry no Gen Tso s Chicken here serene atmosphere attentive staff My roommate lived in China for several years and this was the best Chinese meal he s had in the US I completely agree this may be the finest Chinese I ve ever sampled I think Allix T was expecting something like Avalon I can understand her disappointment I will be returning to Anise very soon 
aCmb3vnCT-0wcCMOUbv6gg CMU I have been living in shame for months how could I live a 5 minute walk away without having stepped foot here Preposterous I know At the urgings of many a friend and yelper I finally gave it a shot Lesson 1 with Quest Diagnostics across the street lunchtime is a no no the place was packed like Big Daddy Kane before collection time Still our 12 30 entrance resulted in a reasonable 15 minute wait It gave me time to look at all folks that one doesn t typically see in Central white middle aged middle class people I d gotten used to the crackies crazies and hipsters so this was quite a shock I took off my hoop earrings End of digression The place was clean and efficient Get a number at the front they ll call your party True to Pete s anecdote they served us two pitchers of water when we sat down Along came a flustered server nice but impatient When I ordered in Mandarin she quacked I Vietnamese speak English now sounding much like Mimi from the Drew Carey Show with a similar display of hair An entertaining character for sure I really wanted pea pod stems snow pea greens but they were 11 bucks a plate twice as much as the regular lunch specials so we went with the dun dun tofu appetizer pea pods with black mushrooms dried shitake and bamboo canned and a vegetable noodle soup Hate to say it but the mushys smelled like pee My dumb ass pointed it out midway through the meal and of course neither of us could eat it after that but the homeless guy outside was happy Sadly he didn t get even a bit of the tofu it was the star of the show I ll certainly be getting my Chinese fill here as they serve both American and authentic favorites Dim sum on the weekends too Update Two days in a row and counting They have nio ro mien the Taiwanese spicy beef brisket soup Mu Lan the Taiwanese joint on Broadway doesn t even have it MCs version lacks the authentic noodles and skimps on veggies but whatever If you ve got any inclination to be warmed up from the inside out ORDER IT 
acy9A_IMkinWoi9hac9uQA CMU The Scorpion Bowl was a monumental occasion for me when I was first drinking The large fishbowl sized cocktail served with nearly foot long straws opened my eyes to the wonderful world of novelty cocktails 
adhf7qVANfTrKAewmJnFvg CMU First time visitor at Mary Chungs Oh my god The Dun Dun noodles and the Chuan La Show appetizer are sooooooo delicious Mind blowing Not for the timid and weak though it is pretty spicy YUM Service was great the middle aged lady at the counter Mary Chung herself greeted me and she liked that I had done my research Ordered everything to go and I was out of there in 4 minutes Thank you Yelpers for another gem 
aDNmbjzuZfEwAIbUL5HmZA CMU I picked up takeout from here on my way to my sister s house to do laundry and veg out for a night it was ok we got beef with broccoli chicken green curry chicken red curry and pad thai the turnaround time was great 15 minutes and it was ready but the food was only ok the beef with broccoli was solid the curries needed more flavor and the pad thai was only ok AND they forgot to give us rice normally it wouldnt have been a big deal but you definitely need some rice with curry 
AET9Bgfh59rH1j0ZR6Ll0w CMU This place is probably one of the strangest places I have been to in Harvard Square This place has a very American 1970 s style Chinese restaurant on the 1st floor and a very gritty dance floor on the 3rd floor This place did not bring back any great memories of the Hong Kong nightlife in Lan Kwai Fong but I had a fun time with some friends despite the strange environment A few friends and I went up the stairs and into a dance floor Fortunately there is no cover charge The music was really loud when we left the dance floor my ears felt like they lost some hearing The bar was really small it s just a window where you can order drinks The bartender makes the drinks in a small room There s very limited counter space if you want to put your drinks down and do some dancing or if you are really crazy do strange stuff I remember my friends and I got a couple of Scorpion Bowls which is this pink colored juicy alcoholic drink served in a large bowl filled with ice They were cool and sort of refreshing tasted a little like grapefruit juice and they were not too strong We also had some drink shots of Tequila and one of my friends felt really funny after drinking all that I also started to feel some intoxication as well It also lead to food cravings as well For some strange reason I actually found the food here really tasty I guess after you drink a lot of alcohol you actually find some of the most mediocre food to be tasty The good thing is that the actual restaurant is open really late and a lot of people from the dance floor actually eat the food We got a couple of noodle dishes We ordered Gon Chao Ngau Ho which is usually known as the Fried Beef Chow Foon We also decided to get the Mandarin Chow Mein or Mandarin Fried Noodles which are these fried noodles mixed with shrimp and vegetables The Gon Chao Ngau Ho was good but needed some more flavor The Fried Noodles were actually tasty and the sauce made the fried noodles tastier The noodles also came in fast If I went here without any alcohol in my body I think the food would have just been mediocre and if I was originally from Toronto New York or San Francisco I may have thought that the food would be below average Overall this is not a bad choice if you are looking for one of the strangest places in Harvard Square for some fun It s also not a bad choice to get some decent but really mediocre Chinese food If someone asked me where they can get a Scorpion Bowl in Cambridge I probably would direct them to this place 
AewTKwqs6OGdMbnQbwImCg CMU What is it about Hong Kong that keeps me coming back Is it the scorpion bowls I always SWEAR I wont order but then someone passes me a straw or is it the ridiculously funny bouncers I love to mess with practically all night I try to ignore all the crimson kids with glasses and fleece jackets and most nights there i m in a state perfectly able to All in all if you re bouncing around in Harvard Square make Hong Kong a spot on your list 
af4Hhw7S5sp2euFs90F3eA CMU I took out some food from Anise today After a long St Patty s day outing I was still feeling a little undernourished so today I really needed some noodle soup goodness Wisteria is a little far away for pick up and I think Mulan is closed on Mondays So this was my first visit to Anise even though I ve wanted to go many other times In addition to the noodle soup I ordered the Sichuan beef dumplings in sweet hot sauce Yum For take out it was excellent A tupperware full of soft wheat noodles in spicy savory broth with chunks of beef the beef wasn t great was exactly what I needed Next time I might ask them to leave the beef out though Unlike some takeout the soup was combined with the noodles etc in one tupperware After some time it would probably sog up but I was able to enjoy it quickly The dumplings were superb Simple and delicious with a hint of spice and the sauce garlicky I liked it Anyway it hit the spot for an 8 lunch I d get it again But their lunch menu appeared limited And their dinner menu is a little expensive I m babbling It s Monday after St Patty s day I think I m allowed to babble Side note 20 minimum for deliveries 3 charge 
aFpmeLHQr9zGdUixnLiYtQ CMU I ve been eating at Royal East for almost twenty years but I won t be any more The food has remained basically the same usually good quality but the service was horrifying the last time I was there It was 8 30 at night and they had obviously just finished serving a very large group Most of the tables were empty but not in their usual places We were squished into the corner next to the one other table with people After we ordered the wait staff started breaking down the tables and moving them all over the restaurant Our table was shaking like a San Francisco earthquake Thank God it only took about 10 minutes Once it was done the staff acted as if it had never happened It s a shame because I have always enjoyed the food here But I work hard for my money and there was no reason that had to take place while we ate 
agThB4PRJBvkI9h4AXmIAw CMU after reading of so many recommendations to try the szechuan food do not even bother with the thai food menu despite the name i decided to venture forth for a bowl of steaming hot spicy noodle soup when i walked into the relatively clean well lit and completely empty restaurant it was 4pm on labor day the man sitting behind the front desk barely looked at me as he led me to the first table wow the friendliness is non existent here i perused the menu and decided to change from the spicy beef noodle soup to the shredded pork with pickled mustard i was somewhat craving this ooh bad choice the soup that was served with it was bland and tasteless to remedy this i picked up the red plastic container at the side of every table and poured what i thought was chili oil into the soup instead it was vinegar it added a little more flavor by the time i finished my meal more people have come in mostly those who seem to frequent this place i picked up the menu on my way out the door and resolved to come back to test out their spicy beef noodle soup there was a hot chili pepper annotated next to this dish on their menu 
AIgXXxU6oudsOhDlpdfbMQ CMU This is the exact place where my boyfriend said out loud maybe I am just a townie maybe that s why I love this place well I too am I townie cause this place is right it s righter than right it s super right I love the decor it s so movie Chinese Restaurant We came in for lunch the prices are so reasonable We had the famed Dan Dan noodles which my boy won t stop talking about amazing tangy sesame scented spicy combo d with chewy noodles fantastic We had hot and sour soup as well it was well seasoned tasty with a good balance the portion was huge also had another noodle with a brown gravy and ground pork can t look the name up since the website is down but it was fab it s like mama cooking it s like left over it s nice and mild super hot temp and huge bowl for like 5 it was awesome The guy who complained about lemon chicken ummm dude that s what lemon chicken is like seriously breaded cutlet with gooey lemon sauce that s not something i would order if i wanted authentic I love this place and would go back every time i visit 
aJGMLAGq6ipQrQOGmmKQ1Q CMU You ever get that not so fresh feeling This is the type of place where you realize you ve been taking for granted the other places you re used to regularly eating The Thai food here was SOOOOOO bad that I now appreciate every other place I ve been to even the not so great places in the Back Bay Satay How do you go wrong with this Tasted like dried beef jerky in teriyaki sauce that they submerged in a cup of water for about an hour to re hydrate it then ram a stick through it and hey presto satay Oh and the peanut sauce ugh curry flavored diahrea like that mug of fat bastard s bowel collection that Austin Powers drank thinking it was coffee We had the Pad See Yoo and yes SEE YOU LAYTAH AWFUL The broccoli looked like LAST week s reject that even the dog didn t want to piss on The noodles tasted like something out of a can of fecal waste The place is awful I don t think I ve ever yelped about anything as bad as this and I just want this stuff to pass through my system so that I can examine the nuclear waste that pops out FAIL 
aJUX5epzQm-zl65WSoIsRQ CMU Let s get something different My girlfriend said one faithful night when we were pondering where to get noms She had ideas of new places that I haven t been the problem was that all of those places were jam packed to the brim with some places having lines Heck even Yenching where we will sometimes default to was jammed packed So we walked down further and passed that burger place extremely long line right next to Hong Kong So why not We ordered an appetizer combo of boneless ribs wings chicken fingers and crab Rangoon If I go again I will probably get a full order of the Rangoon as it was tasty Everything else tasted standard chinese food My girlfriend got the beef basil noodles and I got the general gua s chicken The Basil was really good The General Gua s was better then most places Generally it comes off too sweet and barely spiced I was at least able to taste the spice on my first bite Will go again Maybe There was nothing bad about the place and even then this review for me is more of a place holder for if I go back I can go oh yeah going to get a full order of the Crab Rangoon 
AklaCMJsZwoRguPh5SX1fw CMU I ll be honest as a college student I have a not so little hole in my heart for Thailand Cafe It s good it s cheap and the delivery is suspiciously fast Amazing though it is not I generally consider pad thai to be my measuring stick for Thai restaurants and Thailand Cafe s is only okay Edible satisfies a craving but not on the top of my best pad thais ever list However when you re on a budget need dinner to be at your door in 15 minutes or on your plate in 10 you really can t beat Thailand Cafe 
al3S1tRtC5ZXTC7PvQIcig CMU I was super excited to come here after hearing super positive things from friends and coworkers but I left disappointed Perhaps I ordered poorly but the dun dun noodles or I have bizarre expectations for what Sichuan food is supposed to be Something about the noodle seasoning seemed off and unauthentic to me and I don t think I ll be visiting Mary Chung s again Alas I m going to have to continue searching for my spicy Asian food fix in Cambridge elsewhere 
aloHu-O4zJwrZ2XWUa917g CMU Great Chinese food Somewhat oily The dry fried chow foon is great Plenty of room so there s never a wait for a table Seafood seems pretty fresh though I have never had it my grandparents always order it 
alt_Xd9wmVhy4wFb5MYgWw CMU we have been coming here since longer back than I can remember My favorite chinese restaurant in the Boston area Here s a few things to ask for that don t always appear on the menu but they have and will make for you pan fried grey sole with ginger and scallions lobster fried with garlic and butter pan fried noodles with vegetables no bean sprouts sauteed pea tendrils general gao s is the way to go don t get lo mein it s gross anywhere 
anMeXcq2H_p_mKFAB6Cq5A CMU This food may be cheap but I d rather starve and save my money The food is terrible The scallion pancakes are decent but no one can really mess those up I d take Panda Express ANY DAY over this place The beef noodle soup was hot water noodle and beef _ absolutely NO flavor The orange chicken is disgusting And the crab rangoons are cream cheese filled fried stuff that tasted purely like cream cheese I would have been better off eating the philadelphia stick in my fridge I hate bashing on places but this is as honest as I can get I don t understand how they are still in business 
AP0Im8lQf9S6n-HFe15mJg CMU Pu Pu Hot Pot is one of the cheapest Chinese restaurants in the city and it is the best cheap Chinese food around The staff is awesome and if I ever saw or heard of someone getting bad service to me it would be more of a reflection on their character than that of the staff Even if you had a bad experience there you probably didn t spend more than ten bucks so is it really worth Yelping about And all the complaints about the food being greasy If you don t like greasy food maybe cheap Chinese wasn t the way to go 
Ap2SYY09VaILJ2KtkoptKw CMU for whatever reason I ve walked by this place a bunch of times but never went in A friend recommended it for the schezuan menu I had the beef noodle soup and can t wait to go back Very reasonably priced and quick sitdown lunch place I recommend it 
AQ9ZQqM27HowH-phtF25Gw CMU So me and my friend had lunch there and the food was pretty good I left 12 tip As I was walking away the waitress yelled at me You need to leave 15 next time Well guess what girlfriend THERE WON T BE A NEXT TIME 
aQrxRn-wI0G0mrrmUm9XuA CMU Is it the best Chinese food in the Boston area heck no Is it an amazingly beautiful restaurant definitely not but this place gets five stars because it delivers very solid food and has some of the nicest employees you will ever meet It is not easy finding a very family friendly restaurant where you don t have to worry one bit about a kid This is the place The owners are very welcoming and have a kid of their own that is 2 They even go so far as coming over to entertain your kids so you can get a moment to eat some of the delicious food that they make Try some of the specials The fish beef with Chinese vegetables and the noodle dishes are all very good 
aRVyKC5pZ3WjZLCsYJDe_w CMU Anise is a great place to satisfy your adrenaline rush need for spice straightforward chili heat and the hard to find numbing pleasure of sichuan peppercorns And it s perfect pre movie din din before going to the Kendall theater a few steps away As for the food Vinegary scallop soup featured many of the flavors of a good hot and sour soup Loved the salt and peppercorn crusted beef tenderloin my mouth drools as I write this double cooked pork belly and both the wontons sauce more vinegary and other dumplings sauce more numbing Despite fantastic food on one visit mind you I feel this place won t make it Kendall is a little bit of a ghost town at night Apparently Anise has a bigger lunch crowd But we were one of just three tables in a pretty large and well appointed space So visit now while you can Hopefully these guys can stay in business long enough to build up a following 
AscBVI_hFo6vhxrHDS8zdg CMU Ok so aside from the crappy service this place was actually very tasty It s hard to find Indian Chinese in this country so you really have to relish any chance you get The drums of heaven were heavenly as was the duck appetizer my friend got Mango chicken was great too I kind of wish the place wasn t so pricey and may have ultimately lead to their demise You can find the menu over at the Dosa Factory now but I m not sure what the same dishes will taste like at a hole in the wall restaurant 
aTBp5dHInrcDVjWB_yoGLg CMU Scale of 1 10 single visit 6 Food 8 Service 4 Atmosphere 7 Value 
Atl_4N-MePZKwKRVbv_pYg CMU Great tasting well priced food that comes in large portions Haven t had a bad meal there yet I recommend suan la chow soup and shrimp with cashew nuts I ve also heard that the sesame beef is great 
auRh2dnPscVY9Gef8XLhQA CMU Pretty authentic Chinese restaurant that serves inexpensive family style Szechuan dishes Definitely order the Dan Dan Noodles a little different from other Dan Dan noodles I ve had because of the peanut base but still good and the Suan La Chow Show a spicy meaty wonton that is super filling I would definitely try other items on their menu next time I return P S Cash only 
awRRhrFAxRyE_qXkwtB_XQ CMU I am also obesessed with Suan La Chow Show I have dreams about it If I am having a bad day a bowl of this makes it better I want the recipe It is delicious Easily in my Top 5 dishes final meal requests of all time Everything else is pretty good too but not 5 star Easily a solid 4 
AXKdCph09RFYm1or-uvEFQ CMU After reading the many negative reviews I was hesitant about trying this place for my weekly Saturday ritual lunch But I like to try out places nearby so I gave it a shot I figured I d give a two if this place lived down to expectations a three if the food was merely edible and a four if I enjoyed the food Price and quantity of food are very reasonable with 22 choices on the lunch menu I was rather worried carrying the food home as there was no delicious Chinese food smell The food was pleasant Pork fried rice is important to me and this place did a good job with pork fried rice Maybe it was a little greasy but that was expected for fast food I had chicken fingers and spare ribs a nice lunch option and the food was tasty 
ay3N9ypQOnlUmjnB_QUFKw CMU Part surprise part disappointment for me I walked into the restaurant with my roommate as we were on a Discover a New Place night The place is very clean for a chinese restaurant which always helps me enjoy my food a little more I ordered Combination 20 which came with Sweet and Sour Chicken Crab Rangoon Lobster Sauce and Pork Fried Rice a very non asian meal My roommate ordered the Pai Gu Spare Ribs I believe The food there is REALLY cheap and affordable especially for college students and its location is pretty nice right next to Cinderella s and Toscinini s so we were able to go pick up some ice cream afterwards The food there was neither horrible nor outstanding and I really needed to use the restroom but it was occupied for almost ten minutes I don t think I ll be going back as there are a lot of cheap places in Boston 
AYlGbTg1yh7Tcgvik3oGBg CMU Seriously guys I don t know why you wouldn t give the Hong Kong five stars Maybe it speaks to my character but I can think of nothing more deserving of the coveted 100th review Throw your gripes about the questionable food grimy bathrooms and yeah dude bum grabs out the window You will have fun here It is a certainty If I have out of town guests who want to get a true taste of my post college working girl in the city life where do I take them Not the school where I am expanding my mind not the workplace where I am climbing the career ladder but rather to the Hong Kong where I am killing my liver 99 99 percent of the awesomely bad mistakes I have made in the past year took place here In fact that is about how I would sum up going to the Kong an awesomely bad mistake Oh yeah you want to be on my scorpion bowl race team Trust me 
AyqLyIgzkJW33wGllvnpCw CMU As Shabu beginners we were left lost The menu should come with more of an instruction manual The staff were unable to communicate much about the process or the options On the good side I did eat a lot of veggies Although now reading the reviews it seems they would tastier with a better stock We ordered both a meat and seafood dinner While we ordered pork and lamb for the meat they looked identical Sometimes tough but that may have been in the cooking The seafood was uneven The servings were large It would be very crowded with four people at the booth we were at The dessert however was disgusting Wonder bread with a glowing lime pot of goo The thought lingered on way longer than I wish it had And when I think of Shabu Square I think my first thoughts will be of green goo and wonder bread and then I will think of another place to eat 
aZDd1GUiuT9eJGgTZzZang CMU I love the Kong at 3 in the morning as much as the next drunk square walker but man they disappoint sometimes Here s a for instance tonight I made the mistake of ordering the chow foon with tiny shrimp never never order shrimp at Hong Kong why BECAUSE THEY CONSISTENTLY DO NOT CLEAN IT and that s gross stick to chicken and if you don t do land animals skip the kong and head to clover around the corner 
aZj0fQwF_gGCPXpof0UIfQ CMU The waitress was really horrible 
A_MPF5cGAQT4r4Zxtys3Qw CMU My idea of a good time is totally going to a bar that has the ambiance of a Super 8 Lobby Those green walls the oddly placed tables totally hits the feng shui spot Yeah I come here for the scorpion bowls but recently the bartenders haven t been adding the little plastic toys which is really ruining it for me Maybe someone choked on a mermaid or donkey or something Also where do they get those plastic toy sets Who thinks that donkeys and mermaids go together Anyway my usual visit to the Hong Kong goes as such 1 Come up the stairs get IDs checked about 5 minutes for a decent sized group of friends 2 go to the bar get 3 scorpion bowls beg for plastic toys watch them mix together pre measured unmarked tubs of liquid to make the things The aliquots of booze mix definitely look like pH calibrating liquid Bar step takes 5 minutes 3 Race drink those bowls as fast as possible I m thinking 2 minutes or sos 4 Leave Go to a bar with real ambiance 
B-Nd02rdoanHXNLXa3ro0g CMU After glancing at reviews of other yelpers I have come to understand that the Hong Kong is not just a restaurant on the first floor I will check it out maybe I recently brought a female to this locale for a date Lots of hilarious things that would be a negative for most people but definitely were awesome for me Cheesy restaurant owner and his wife directly by the front door smiling 24 7 Check Weird ESL server who made crude jokes and attempted to hit on my female using sound effects Hilarious check Scorpion bowl that could be alternatively used to strip paint Check Tasteful ambience Uhhh Overpriced appetizers Check Floating plastic mermaid and unicorn in the scorpion bowl Check I love it I love it I love it What I won t forget When I was in 8th grade me and my boy Brian went to this restaurant to have dinner after we visited my parent who works at Harvard After 5 minutes of eating and getting glares from the staff the owner of the restaurant came over and started talking about the weather The weather and how we should go see Eventually all subtlety was cut out and he just said It nice out You go now I can only assume he thought we were there to crash the bar scene or grab booze or something Nonetheless aggressive move by the octagenarian Good times 
B0JEABRBhXiSAPZr0WLnxg CMU oh god this place I never start out at this place I usually end up at the Kong after being over served at other fine establishments It s usually when I m drunk enough that the rational side of my brain starts to fade away that I think it is a great idea to go to the Kong I always wake up the morning after deeply regretting my decision Anyways I have a very real Massachusetts Liquor ID and every time I come here and go to the upstairs bar the bouncers always end up staring at it for at least 5 minutes probably because they think it makes them look cool or adept at their job Or maybe it gives them a boner thinking they have some false sense of authority Imagine the biggest douchebag you ve ever met this is what the bouncers here look like x 100 One time they came close to not letting me in at all Frankly that wold have been a blessing From my experience the clientele consist of a lot of dudes that un ironically pop their collars and hot chicks with a pound of makeup on that are a few scorpion bowls and a roofie away from getting date raped The scorpion bowls are ok Tastes like a big bowl of Hi C Fruit Punch and the potency varies I feel like I have been cheated when they don t throw a bunch of plastic animals in my drink I ordered a Jager Bomb here once and the bartender asked me if I wanted a real Jager Bomb I assumed there was only one way to make them red bull Jager and your face so I said yes I was fairly drunk already but not to an obnoxious stupor I didn t pay attention to the guy making it because I was talking to my boyfriend We both got one and started to pound them immediately About halfway through we realized we were served a shot of Jager and a draft of some piss beer And it cost 20 Seriously This place is what it is though and great idea I have when I m already wrecked Plus they have Chinese food which is easy to shovel in my mouth and keep down when I ve lost most of my basic motor skills 
b1BPE_XLlc46bQlvBg9WAg CMU I was so disappointed I decided to try Mary Chung s because a friend recommended it and there are glowing reviews on Yelp However the brown rice was over cooked and inedible and the mapow tofu was greasy slimy and grainy like broken egg shells The waitress was rude and in a hurry even though the restaurant was half empty The table was kind of dirty and the atmosphere depressing Steer clear I had one bite of my meal and had to leave immediately It took me hours to get the gross after taste out of my mouth 
B2JvKO55O2H0ipcxEHlh-g CMU One thing is for sure Don t ever go for lunch I went there for the second time during lunch hour and had another bad experience This time it was TERRIBLE service We had to plead with different servers for basic things like utensils napkins and water at least 4 times before we got them I noticed that I see different waiters everytime I went there and the quality seemed to be the worst the last time One of them for example dropped a steamer that had dumplings in them right before serving them to people in a table near ours Then he tried convincing them to eat the dumplings that had fallen on the floor When they insisted for a replacement he got a new steamer in 2 minutes It takes longer than that just to walk to the kitchen and back Overall experience 1 star 
BBVqvAdyQ6k9WWqKILCx-g CMU This is the archtype for all greasy down and dirty American Chinese Food places in the world Taking up four floors tables on the basement and first floor bar on the second and a comedy club on the third the Hong Kong is most famous for its huge Scorpion Bowls that are decorated with plastic mermaids palm trees and animals sitting happily on the floating orange and lemon slices in your drink This is a great place for a group to meet nothing beats a table for ten with a huge spread of fried appitizers while the Zombies Sufferng Bastards and Scorpion Bowls are being sucked quicker than the duck sauce Don t expect to be bowled over by the cuisine it is what it is But if you don t have a soft spot for good old fashioned greezy chinese food check your pulse you may be dead 
bCLefpHYFah2-LRxDUWDMQ CMU fu qi fei pian tasted slightly less spicy but 80 90 authentic Zhong shui jiao was 80 authentic too viscous a little too much sugar not enough hot oil Pork with leek and peppers too much dou shi so a little bit on the salty side pork a little undercooked I d recommend this place to other Chinese Sichuan people but the price range is not in line with the quality Although it is less Asian fusion than some other Asian fusion places Waitresses were Thai but were very nice and wanted to learn how to pronounce the dishes in Chinese 
BCwkmfBT8kv9-_yn_yG9_w CMU I do not know what has taken me so long to write about this place but if you have not tasted the food here yet change whatever your plans are for this evening and go The menu has some of the good ol standbys like crab rangoon and general gau s chicken and the quality is high no sketchy pieces of mystery meat but this is not what you go there for Try the dun dun noodles or dun dun on anything so delish the yu xiang fish the stuffed eggplant the spicy string beans and the suan la chow xio Ah the suan la So hot so amazing And while I always want to order something new I never can steer away from the things I love The only thing I have ordered and downright did not like was the velvet chicken The giant plate of giggling white stuff egg white and chicken in the blender like a milkshake was the explanation I was given when it arrived at my table was just not appealing to look at or eat in my opinion But do not let that stop you Next time you crave Chinese head to Mary Chung and leave happy 
BEmGa0dcg9zGbqfCIcjpLg CMU They claim to have authentic Cantonese cuisine here I have yet to see it but if you are looking for greasy mediocre Americanized Chinese food this is the place to go It s cheap fast and fairly edible 
Bf7GaxFB4AgcSpUBUHpvQA CMU Meat was undercooked It had to be taken back and recooked Server was also kind of rude 
bfdMdJIPS2MITEUsvkpBrg CMU I just had my wedding rehearsal dinner for 60 at Royal East The manager Otto worked with me to put together a menu that met my needs and budget He spent lots of time discussing the menu with me accommodating the seating arrangements for the children in my party making sure I ordered a well rounded mix of tasty dishes The food is authentic and yummy the service excellent and the price very reasonable I look forward to hosting other family events at Royal East in the future They have a separate room for parties in the back that is spacious I found it hard to find quality venues in the Boston area for large groups that were not really expensive Thanks Royal East 
bFFcQL8DaV55T59W2IgbWg CMU If I m desperate I ll down some vegi stir fry but its just barely edible 
bFyR61ohZ1JXqk36-fWrLQ CMU They changed the spelling a bit they changed the prices quite a bit and I don t understand why I should go back At these prices I can find a much better bang for my buck by walking a few steps And if I wanted to pay these prices I would look elsewhere I would be surprised if they are still there in a year Particularly if they don t cultivate loyalty I live in Harvard Square and I did not even know they had opened until I walked by 
bGjzbwULezvuyzepwfZxuw CMU The inspector isn t letting them use the shabu tables to cook shabushabu WHAT This is why I came here Better change the name quick I felt misled Food was otherwise good I give it one star for the rouse 
BgWRWhXX5wuq71oh3VVQCQ CMU The Hong Kong is what my friends and I like to call our finisher We go here at 1 AM after all the other bars in Cambridge close and eat the greesiest Chinese food and drink scorpion bowls out of a bowl with tiny plastic giraffes floating in it What more could you want 
bHqiL4j8HLgJcijVAE4f9g CMU Tried this restaurant out and it was disappointing overall First off on a warm evening the place was hot A C worked poorly The music was on and off The decoration was OK we sat upstairs The bathroom was marginally clean the small cocktail napkins instead of paper towels was odd The menu was strangely organized and a bit confusing We had the duck samosas just two were served The breading seemed overpowering The paneer appetizer was more generous with a lot of veggies The caulilfower appetizer was tasty but again not really a lot for the money We had the mango chicken which was OK but have had better versions of this dish And the house noodle dish was a fair version of Pad Thai You can get much better Pad Thai dishes in many area restaurants and for less money Maybe they are still ironing out the kinks But would I go back No There are too many other places that specialize in either Chinese Asian or Indian cuisine and do a much better job of of it 
bitZLqt-DO6VYjn01kcWUA CMU I had my first scorpion bowl here and nothing has compared since great late night food stop On the weekends the upstairs turns into a club But if you go with a big group you can score the upstairs booth and that s a great nook for people watching and still being able to hear the people in your group Upstairs is really loud The food is fair but it gets better with every drink you have ingested sober fair wasted delicious Also the chance of having annoying loud drunk college kids as ambiance increases with every passing hour as the night goes on 
BJ1K7wJ9KR043bnfp3Pw1A CMU Extremely disappointing I ve been to my score of Chinese restaurants in Europe and North America from decent ones to super dodgy ones and I must say this one is possibly the worst I ordered 7 different dishes just for myself and there wasn t enough to get me full that I could stand to eat Only the starters were decent 
BJesw76FnWHJp6utdQc_Bg CMU AWFUL Avoid at all costs Overcooked food smothered in canned sauces and served by untrained college students WAY overpriced 
BjFquWn4EyqLyFe5hm9b7w CMU I have so many good memories from this place It was by far the most popular go to restaurant for delivery for my friends and I during our college years More often than not it s very very quick Food is cheap 10 and less for meals and that food will last you a couple of meals My favorite is the pad thai Orange chicken has kind of a funky flavor to it I am a huge fan of the Thai iced tea I get it every time It s actually my favorite and I ve had plenty of experiences with various kinds of it Want to eat there Go for it It s right on Mass Ave It s kind of a hole in the wall place so you might miss it if you walk too fast It s on the outskirts of the MIT campus The service is very very friendly They make sure your needs are met and are very attentive I have been here and ordered from here countless times It s not the most stellar Asian food place but if I m in the area I ll definitely go back 
BmA3iu4eFstLs7aMY4uo-Q CMU I ve been coming here for years simply because it s the better of 2 Chinese restaurants in the Square The food is kind of hit or miss depending on what you order so I usually just get my favorites The portions are very generous They do have great service most of the time except when they get super busy around lunch Mr Yenching is fantastic can speak at least 3 languages fluently I suspect maybe even more and will always throw in free food when I order take out He also gave some friends a ride home once after closing up the restaurant The proprietor really makes this place 4 stars instead of 3 
bmHZWVh8Dxa1qSPBsZJhcw CMU As far as cheap take out goes when you re trying to satisfy a severe MSG craving this is where it s at I m with Rishi on just the satisfaction I get from SAYING that I m over at Pu Pu Hot Pot I ve had a super awesome delivery guy in the past who I ve made some unintelligable conversation with and tipped despite the Free Delivery 1 Delivery Charge stated on the menu Don t order any calimari It smells bad and is like chewing on a firestone Firestone with spicy tomato goo coming up Oh dear god it s coming up AGAIN Must Restrain Intestinal Backlash SOMEONE GET A SPONGE 
BoUGdFkiU6EVsHGSvt-Uwg CMU The guys that I work with love this place but I have never been overly impressed with anything I ve tried here It gets pretty crowded at lunch time since they have luncheon specials for under 5 
BP9cX-3oN0dTaPikvArzfA CMU Amazingly clean and well appointed bathroom for a restaurant which otherwise could only be described as completely bereft of atmosphere save the view from the window Should you be considering the Pu Pu Hot Pot for a meal heed my advice and RUN Poo Poo Crap Pot is the name my Dining Partner in Crime has dubbed by the way there is NO hot pot on the menu 
Bq5L0MyhFS-lz1aYyVGmZA CMU Mary Chung s Mary Chung s what to say about Mary Chung s Its cheap enough and its good enough Although most of the dishes are mediocre at best they knock the ball out of the park on a a few A few years back a friend turned me on to the suan la chau chow MmMmm thx Tim Its highly recommended What does suck is that they dont take credit cards A dinner for two with appetizers and main dishes can add up and not taking cards is a detriment Maybe they re cooking the books as well as the food I M KIDDING its probably the transaction fees credit card companies charge establishments So bring cash along with your appetite 
bRVDx0MGvSfqBkaLXN1rNQ CMU Their chicken teriyaki bowls are a cheap godsend I ve also had general tso s chicken which was among the better I ve had in Boston I wouldn t stray too far from classics like these in a place like this though 
bSIscMT5sPC7k1ZlxPhgFw CMU Food is delicious and decent but very pricey compare to other Chinese restaurant It s understandable since the rent in Harvard square is more expensive A small wonton soup with only 2 or 3 wonton cost 3 
bSsn7lvJM2aglSbDHvUkXA CMU I simply could not wait to come back and write a review for this shithole before I forgot some of what went on tonight while I was there Allow me to explain So my buddy says he s having a party there tonight for his roommate and I should come by He says people are getting there at ten I m interested in the hockey game so I get there at 8 00pm knowing I ll be alone I didn t realize I d be the only one at the bar who didn t work there No worries of course I really just wanted to watch the game until they got there so it was win win The nice young cute black girl not trying to be racist just trying to discern between the bartenders this becomes more important in a moment serves me a PBR and the guy from upstairs who runs the comedy club offers to put it on his tab So far so good If the night ends here I give this place four stars and I thank everyone there The night continues of course The place gets more packed my friend and his friends arrive it gets more boisterous Not a problem right It s a bar right Okay so the night continues Vancouver scores I cheer Sue me I don t like the Bruins Different story for a different time Didn t think that would be an issue So we re looking a 1 0 in the 3rd period The place is pretty quiet and I m just talking to my buddy about this and that as his buddy puts a beer on the side of the bar I move my right arm and accidentally knock it off the bar I look over and say my bad I ll buy you another there s not person in the world this hasn t happened to The bartender Patrick in this bizarre pink flowered shirt says okay you gotta go I honestly thought he was joking for a second He summons the bouncer who says you gotta go I look around like serious For what exactly Patrick says that and I thought I heard you tell someone to fuck off over here This of course never happened and of course he couldn t produce anyone who had heard me say anything anywhere near that why would I For the majority of the time I was there there were less than five people in the bar So I sign out my tab and I leave Mind you my tab was get this 7 50 and I bought a beer for my buddy meaning I had two beers so I clearly wasn t drunk This bartender was just a douchebag Was he upset I was routing against his beloved Bruins which is the fourth sports team in Boston anyhow Was he upset I accidentally knocked a glass off the bar I would have gladly paid for it But I have never NEVER been kicked out of a bar in my entire life not in college not afterward not ever I m 29 years old I don t drink nearly enough to get escorted out of anywhere Yet Hong Kong has the audacity to tell me I need to leave Tell me Yelpers as I type now at nearly 2 00am do I sound drunk Give me a break 
BUwnvK8vClO7goa6VcoPaA CMU We ordered the jumbo shrimp and the chicken fingers and we found that the jumbo shrimp are about one centimeter wide NO JOKE I even posted a picture It s not even funny how small they were And the chicken fingers were so dry and UNTASTY it sucked This place SUCKS Joyful Garden is SO MUCH BETTER Chicken pan fried noodles were decent but come on Do you really think that I will give this place any higher than zero stars Jesus I think I might report to the manager 
BwLoNu24mXEYBJl4vAbm5A CMU Cheap Googd quality Generally light instead of greazzy Offers an excellent alternative to Royal East 
BwWdCkal5zG3_X5gt92Few CMU My 4 yr old got food poisoning from here Enough said no no My fellow yelpers must know The staff was nice but service and food was awful As a New Yorker I think we can distinguish between good bad Chinese food And this place is bad Not only did they forget a few things but how can you serve dirty utensils So yes I definitely won t be back if ever in harvard square again 
BXtevhFyGmpEg8P59rsTlA CMU Solid 4 stars Tasty and good American Chinese food Too pricey for one meal Enough food for 2 big ones 
ByKQzdCJc5v8_2bkaScOsA CMU One of the few places in Harvard Sq offering cheap drinks and diversityy The 3rd floor offers great hip hop music and dancing Once school is in place is jammed Scorpion bowls are lethal and remember to eat before Chinese restaurant is open late night for those times when you are struggling with the effects of a long night out Atmosphere on the 2nd floor is a little better not as sketchy 
Bywq7xO8t67-E4ColWxyvA CMU This restaurant went from being one of my favourites used to eat here or do take out delivery atleast twice a week to not even being average on my list The quality customer service taste has gone drastically down in the past 2 months Either there is a new chef or the management has changed 
bzux9GAhfwB0E4Lgu80Edw CMU I ate here for dinner for the first time last night It seemed like a decent chinese restaurant when we got in I didn t even know there were more floors to it We ordered scorpion bowls on the recommendation of those who had been there before They were quite good and decently alcoholic Everyone else in my party ordered a ton of dishes to be eaten family style but I only ate the vegetable lo mein It was tasty enough though lacking in vegetables in my opinion No broccoli even Overall it was a fine chinese restaurant experience About par for the course 
C-oAQYrduDwS7S2xh0P2Eg CMU The Pad Thai and other thai dishes I ve tried have all been tasteless or bad tasting From what I ve heard from a friend the Szechuan dishes are much better With my disappointing experiences however I don t plan to come back to find out for myself 
c17vK7awFi64t3iEUddeGA CMU There is no place like Mary s It s not American Chinese and it s not Chinatown Chinese Mary Chung s Restaurant serves a battery of Cantonese and Sichuan dishes in its own style Here are a few tips for eating at Mary s for the newcomer DON T expect superb ambience The restaurant is clean and red and brightly lit DON T order anything that appears on the menu of American Chinese restaurants DO bring cash It is doubtful that plastic will ever be accepted DO order from the short list of house specialties on the front of the menu the first time you go to best get the feel of the place DO giggle at the fact that the table is set with a water pitcher and teacups and the waitress always starts by bringing you tea and water glasses This too will probably never change Until someone else can make suan la chow show better than Mary s it will remain my favorite restaurant 
C38vCXvGdW9lbTwGsyQG9g CMU No delivery only pick up THEN DON T PUT THE PHRASE DELIVERY AVAILABLE ON YOUR MENUS The cold is turning me into a cantankerous beast so I m pretty pissed about being denied delivery two nights in a row But despite my displeasure I must admit the food here is decent Obviously Americanized but done well The service varies the waitresses don t seem exactly ecstatic to be attending to you but they execute the job and my water cup stayed nice and full all night Worth eating at if you crave Chinese at Harvard just don t plan for delivery 
c3cAB4TX-zQobmc45WNNZg CMU greasy chinese food but i love this place food is reliable they give you a lot and it s very cheap they also have a japanese counterpart that s less greasy and also offers sushi it looks healthier but i don t like it as much good for the price and one of the few places open 7 days a week around mit they keep the food court open just for these two restaurants also the food is slightly addictive 
c4DXUdidO-7XH0s_BKBf9Q CMU I don t live in the Boston area so I can t tell you that I went to 10 Chinese restaurants in Cambridge and that this was the best one I will tell you that I just walked out of there all smiles after a 3 hour banquet for 70 people The dishes were pretty much all excellent There were lots of dishes many based on seafood lobster crab whole fish It s relevant that the dinner was organized by a Chinese customer who has been patronizing the restaurant for 10 years I imagine that I won t get the same level of food if I walk in without him Still this evening at least I was blown away 
C8ncyQb9QQYgeWUa1KfMJw CMU Our waitress rocked she kept bringing us beer after beer until my friend Bill s eyes were glazed over and we drank through their entire stock of Heineken On to the Tsingtao and the night got a little fuzzy and the food got a whole lot better Ordered pot stickers and some kind of fiery broccoli fantastic So spicy that I had to cool down my mouth with more beer and brown rice We were practically the only people there and our waitress Alice ended up chatting with us Turns out she chose the English name Alice because she was given that name during a French class but that s not the point She is so cool I d go back and sit in her section anytime 
c8tFKKdrXDG4Yo1zSL2JDw CMU Great food love the fusion of Indian and Chinese 
cARxnE5ZV5Oyf5XO6YZZvg CMU Great SCHEZUAN FOOD Don t let the reviews for the Thai food take this place down this place has some of the best authentic chinese food in cambridge This place deserves a clean slate since they changed management chef It has transformed my opinion of them from 1 star to 5 Here are some recommendations 1 Towel Gourd Sounds strange but it s just a juicy green vegetable in a yummy garlic sauce Perfect non greasy compliment to the rest of the dishes you ll get 2 Pork in garlic sauce Slices of pork with veggies in a tangy mildly spicy sauce One of my favorites here 3 Cold Beef tongue tripe and meat Very spicey and sliced into thin pieces that counteract the normally chewy texture of tripe Not a big fan of tripe normally but this dish hits the spot 4 Tofu with ground pork not sure how exactly they translate it but just ask for Mabo Dofu Spicy and oily tofu with ground pork and green scallions Done really well here and perfect to order with rice 5 Pork belly with chestnuts Very tender pork belly pieces with roasted chestnuts Deliciousness may be directly proportional to how fatty the pieces of meat are will update more as i go there more often Great find and especially a favorite for being so close to MIT 
cbOGy332K0iviOPohpbDiA CMU Great Thai place before they changed the menu Experience The staff is decent They re attentive and friendly I ve never gone when they re super busy so I don t recall ever waiting for a table even when I had a group of 8 Food old menu This WAS the place to get Thai food for cheap I put Thai in parentheses because it had a strong Chinese influence and wasn t authentic Thai food new menu They switched their menu from Chinese Thai to authentic Szechuan Chinese food It s good if you re from that region and you re looking for authentic dishes However even though I m Chinese I m not from that region and all their spices taste like dish soap to me I can t imagine it tasting good to others I know none of my American friends like the taste Overall Be warned of the spice that taste like dish soap I give it two stars because this is a good place for authentic Szechuan dishes However not a good place for Thai food even though it s Thailand Cafe and definitely not good if you re not accustomed to that spice I apologize I don t know the English name for that particular spice 
CBshXhFlKDREAb3X1onXRg CMU I am very sad to say that Yenching has earned my first one star review on Yelp I really could not have imagined a more terrible experience My friends and I left in a daze had ALL of THAT just happened Food The Orange Chicken was god awful the worst I have ever had The meat was gray and chewy and the flavor was way off My friends also tried and agreed My friends all enjoyed their meals to an extent but I don t think anything was stellar Service This is the strange part The owner I presume took our orders While trying to be funny he offended most of the table by critiquing each order and completely disregarding the requests of two people Two of my friends ordered and he responded by saying that they would not like it and that he was going to change their order to something that be more suitable for their palate Never in my life have I experienced a waiter change a customer s order or treat paying customers in such a demeaning manner We ordered dumplings for an appetizer but they did not arrive until after the final entree was served There was at least a fifteen yes FIFTEEN minute gap between the arrival of the first and last person s main meal We had to ask for tea twice until it arrived After the check came we decided that we would not tip a full 15 or 20 So horrified by the service and I by my food we decided that 10 was more than sufficient An older woman came by our table to pick up the bill and actually counted the money at the table in front of us She told us that we had to give a 15 tip Because this was not on the bill or previously stated we did not budge When she left our table momentarily we quickly grabbed our coats and rushed out the door leaving the tip which we decided was fair This was certainly not one of my proudest moments but it felt extremely justified I do not understand how this restaurant is still afloat It seemed busy and popular Maybe we just had a terrible experience in what is usually a decent establishment but none of us will be returning 
cBXeGDS5ZeENPPb0fa3_4Q CMU Yea totally fooled by the concept while walking around on Newbury Should have yelped it from my iPhone Nothing was particularly good and with the fusion of Indian and Chinese cuisines two cultures of taste explosions you d expect just a burst of flavor The only other times I ve had Chinese Indian Chinese Mirch in Manhattan and soon to be Framingham and Tangra Masala in Queens and they were great Mumbai Chopstix just doesn t work All my friends who have been are tricked in by the Peking Duck Samosa and so was I But I should have known that that was just a trap The other Indian Chinese places didn t have any such blatantly fusion style dishes What s more the Peking Duck Samosa might have been the worst dish I got Just a soft mush of somewhat gamey tasting fowl is the best way I could describe the filling The dishes aren t particularly spicy Most dishes have a somewhat sweet slant to them The best description I can come up with is a vaguely indian tasting highly americanized bland thai food All might be almost okay if this was a corner dive takeout joint but it s actually a 15 dollar per entree let alone appetizers and what not sit down restaurant on Newbury St Sorry this is definitely a meh I ve experienced better 
CCkDdMp4P-8l7V3s3G0DcA CMU I tried their lunch buffet and didn t see much authentic Inidian or chinese food It s even worse than Panda Express too bad that i bought their voucher and have to use it will see how it goes this time but after reading all these reviews didn t have much high expectation p 
CegyG7LXsuxiChvXkMSe9Q CMU I wish I had seen all these negative yelp reviews before I walked into this place We walked in extremely hungry but despite our ravenous appetites we were still underwhelmed by the food and particularly the service Although we were seated immediately thanks to the hostess we waited interminably for any service even for some freaking water When our server finally arrived she awkwardly provided us with dipping sauce when we had nothing to dip I ve had very good Chinese Indian fusion in the past Go to Chinese Mirch in NYC so I was very excited for this but here I left very disappointed The food was not necessarily terrible but nothing special or even interesting and certainly not worth the slightly higher price tag Nothing really tasted like fusion at all it was just Chinese food with one or two Indian ingredients swapped in The duck samosas were very good but that s just because deep fried duck dumplings which is essentially what these were are intrinsically very good most deep fried items are simply intrinsically good The hot and sour soup just tasted like hot and sour soup with one or two pieces of paneer swapped in for tofu Their fried rice was just fried basmati rice The desi chicken was basically like a sweet and sour chicken but with some Indian spices Two of my fellow diners got two different fried noodle dishes but they tasted and looked exactly the same with some more hot peppers When our meal was over we again waited interminably for our check to be delivered and collected 
CeVvzz3If60ohYO-YWNMSQ CMU Regardless of the potential redundance of this statement and the horrible cliche I m about to fall into It s called pu pu for a reason And for the sake of those who live with you sleep with you or are in the remote vicinity of you don t order this after a night of drinking You will only compound your problems 
cf3a_3QAoqq0ZVeo2wdonw CMU Was just at Mary s again this week Tea very strong very good and hot temp Egg drop soup hearty and hot temp Spring rolls very large hand wrapped very good Home made mustard very strong and good Sichaun shrimp with pea pods and bamboo shoots and mushrooms very good Not quite Sichuan hot spicy but spicy fresh tasting big meaty prawns served hot temp Service prompt and friendly Only real complaint no credit cards First rate 
CF6dYWKwg1mJm9CQQ2LlRA CMU Simply the finest Chinese take out style food in the area don t let looks deceive you the majority of their food is better than you could get elsewhere at twice the price Bustling at lunch time but in almost ten years I ve never waited for a table more than ten minutes One visit in the late afternoon revealed about half the wait staff seated at a table in back decked out in oversize rubber gloves frantically stuffing and folding that night s dumplings A far cry from the usual freezer to wok strategy One of my favorite General Gau preps just crispy chicken chunks with a little broccoli for color Try the specialties on the front of the menu Good dim sum Closed on Tuesday 
ChfPai3tJUlG-lQHB4wlRQ CMU I have to agree with the previous reviewers that the silly name is at least part of the draw I always giggle to myself when I order here and I take pride in telling people that I had my lunch from Pu Pu Hot Pot I think rishi h said it perfectly I consider myself intellectual and I m definitely mature for my age but there s a little kid in me that giggles and delights in the name Really How often as an adult do you have a legitimate reason to say pu pu That being said the food here is plentiful and cheap It s pretty typical Chinese but I haven t ran into anything I don t like even when the description sounds scary It s definitely greasy but it s also tasty If you ve got a hankering for Chinese this place will satisfy it And do so quickly The delivery has always been prompt and polite I ve ordered lunch and dinner from here and the portion sizes seem to be about the same although lunch comes with rice and soup but lunch is amazingly cheap often under 5 If you re lazy and hungry and want Chinese this is the place to hit 
CizCNjY0HH2EY-q9fskgGw CMU Disgusting food the dumplings were just this gross doughy mushiness the scallion pancakes were like rubber the hot and sour soup was just pure gross the beef with broccoli was more like grease with broccoli Terrible service how can you pay over 20 for food and yet they still charge extra for just a little white rice I ve never ever heard of that Buying two main dishes and two apps should kind of warrant some rice at least it does in every other chinese restaurant I ve ever been to Messed up my order and then gave me attitude when I asked them about it It may be cheap but whether you dine in and sit in the loneliest ugliest emptiest room or take out and risk losing half your order I can t say it s worth any amount of money 
CkihpNiNM7FC3Udvhi3o0Q CMU YUM Super tasty fast and friendly Highly recommend Everything was great so just go for it It ll be delicious whatever you choose 
CKInppDNXIX86JFQPBXR_w CMU A very nice and relaxing environment Very tasty spicy szechuan which was plated beautifully Pork dumplings w rice vinagar were delicious Food was very clean and not greasy Loved the spicy chicken with cucumbers An very attentive cute waiter It was a holiday and was mid afternoon and no other customers Not sure as of why Poor bathroom which is in some scary basement Boo for charging 10 for a pot of oolong tea 
CLHrSvimj5cftfVPxyWLgg CMU What are people thinking This place is DREADFUL Every time I ve had food from here I ve been angry very angry Someone said this place had shiny food shiny with grease and whatever low grade emulsifiers they use There are some bad food restaurants that you go when you want good tasty junk There are bad food restaurants that you want to never enter again the mention of their name fills you with anger Pu Pu Hot Pot is one of the latter 
cmVW-CidcvNPPSceqNLupQ CMU DO NOT COME HERE These are the things that you should know apart from the food is really bad I always walk by and no one is EVER there They have an Asian lady taking your order but the cooks are freakin Indian not even Mexican Prices are cheap but I d rather go hungry I ordered a vegetarian pad thai no freakin sauce It was horrible I had the Kung Pao chicken it was OK Ultimately this is a last resort place If your taste buds are how shall I say it under the influence then it really doesn t matter does it the prices will lure you but avoid at all cost 
CnFo7sxiMxaY6nWgfNFcWQ CMU My favorite place to go when I m in the mood for something spicy and authentic Chinese Try the Velvet Chicken and Yu Hsiang Eggplant or go on a weekend for a different style of dim sum the Shanghai steamer dumplings are quite delectable Good for a mid sized group though probably not the most romantic date Too bad they don t deliver or accept credit cards or else I would give five stars I always end up having to go to the nearby convenience store to get cash Also there is a woman who works here that sounds exactly like Edna from The Incredibles D 
CO2Y-BLK3nUBDeSeH2tG0Q CMU Second worse Chinese food I ve ever had after Mary Chung s I am not sure what is up with Central Square but it has bad Chinese food juju 
cOUsgRwoONA0vUBkueQajA CMU The the lunch specials are great and the menu has a variety of food everything from white person deep fried sweet and sour pork to some real authentic Chinese stuff Portions are hefty and prices aren t bad especially at lunch The staff at this place really takes it from good to great After a few lunch visits the owner knew me well enough to ask about my shopping habits He always goes the extra mile a hot cup of tea while waiting for takeout or a smile on a bad day 
CPOSp2Fb4d6sNP1g-2MTag CMU I ll be the third or fourth to say it meh The service was sort of adorably bad the servers were clearly trying but not what I would call adept Everyone at the restaurant was getting each others orders You could track down your food by looking out for other confused diners The food was really just mediocre across the board It wasn t bad it just wasn t memorable If it had come from one of the myriad cheap local delivery joints in our area I would ve said it was pretty tasty But for upwards of 20 a plate no Finally and least importantly I vastly prefer brown rice to white and was surprised that they only had white I don t expect every restaurant to have everything I like but given that nearly every previously mentioned cheap delivery joint in our area has brown rice I had thought it was sort of a given It s not bad but for the money you can definitely do better 
Crdr5Nllj_RZDHJXrjm5RA CMU so they redid the bottom level restaurant but you still really shouldn t be seen eating there maybe some takeout hot and sour soup if you re desperate consistent and actually kind of good but minus soooo many points for the black box hole in the wall nightclub upstairs 
crU5MzUlpck9Z3Av1Th2ag CMU this place has good food easily the best chinese restaurant around harvard square i ve mostly tried the staple chinese american dishes orange chicken szechwan beef hunan chicken really good and yu shiang chicken i love their dumplings but i love all dumplings so that s not saying much i guess their portions are usually enough for two though that s sorta typical chinese american restaurants they have great lunch specials if you re looking for a deal the best part i d say is the service you walk in and the owner makes you feel like you go there every day that in my book earns its fourth star 
CWDRyYCflxQe7Ffl7x9zbw CMU Semi decent Chinese food This would probably get 1 5 stars from me if I were actually in California But since I am in the freezing Cambridge where there are only two Chinese restaurants within walking distance I won t be as picky Noodle soups aren t bad Seafood noodle soup was more Canto style with the thin egg noodles The beef noodle soup I am not sure what style it was but it was actually quite decent The dan dan noodle was not like any other dan dan noodle I ve had First of all the bowl itself was larger than the size of my face It was entirely filled with noodles Half of the bowl was drenched with creamy sesame sauce and the other half with tza jian with minced meat and the hot sauce in the middle It was HUGE Not bad at all I am not quite sure about MSG but I always have a minor itchy feeling in my throat after I eat here or at Zoe s the other Chinese restaurant within walking distance Not quite sure what is causing it I better not be allergic to Chinese food That would be horrible news 
cxaHgtziWDn12KwQgVugtg CMU I really like this place Is it the best Chinese food I ve ever had Nah Do I feel awkward drinking out of their undersized cups Duh However their staff is friendly and I like the way they make their fried rice better than I do anywhere else I ve found in Cambridge actually has a taste and is the fried rice texture without being drowned in soy sauce Also they give you a plate when you get takeout which is nice and the guy always reminds me that I don t need to tip for takeout which is a nice contrast to the hipsters at Al s Harvard Square glaring at me for not feeling that swiping my card deserves a tip 
cydYqU7L5P2GrxDu_GSWSA CMU This restaurant makes a delicious spinach with garlic I will definitely order again Also they deliver locally with a reasonable fee if you don t have a minimum order and the food arrived quickly and hot 
d0O9xvEjqkO7sITXL_Hi0A CMU Dirty trashy and not in a good way The last time I ate their food was the one time I got delivery from this place I had not one but two bugs in my food Sure they were little and probably harmless fruit flies or gnats or something but one was floating so blatantly in the soup that it really pissed me off There was also something weird and hard and painful to bite in my soup I got the impression that a pencil could have fallen in there and no one would have noticed Otherwise the food was gross I was near passing out hungry that s why I was dumb enough to order from this place no one else would deliver that late and I wasn t expecting anything good only that I d actually be able to eat the food I couldn t though I just couldn t 
D2I2_AekBHe1bZwxsjPE0g CMU I m going to have to start with two stars but I will update as necessary We came here on opening night with a big group i think we were 11 but we had made reservations many hours before We got there early and we still were not seated until 30 minutes after our reservation time They seated us and kind of deposited us in the back corner where we were incredibly cramped The service was less than ok which i can understand since it was opening night but 3 strikes already before I even start talking about the food lucky for them i thought the food was delicious Our dishes were all absolutely delicious and quite different from all the other available food in boston Prices were about what I expected similar portions prices as kashmir I expected this going in but small portions for the price are never good Given that it was opening night i would definitely come back to this place because the food was delicious If they can improve on service and wait time my rating will easily slide up to a 4 star 
d3c04UhPjpL4mL0JUXktAQ CMU Ew 
Da6F4yJ9wgt9oFzr5S_Lhg CMU Located between Kendall and Central square this big restaurant serves up your typical Chinese food You have your orange chicken scallion pancakes your general gau and the hot sour soup All are very tasty and good and they have plenty of seating All meals come with tea and their manager does check in occasionally in the evening to make sure that everything is alright Their prices are great and the decor isn t too bad either They also have a few interesting unique dishes like one of their appetizers which is known as Suan La Chow and which is very popular and typical Szechuan dish as much as the peking hot and sour soup but they re totally different because the hot spices are different as there is little soup but dominated mainly with plum juicy wontons I adore this dish it s just awesome I am also a big fan of their sweet and sour chicken dish which is very meaty and not too sugary and just tastes great Don t like white rice That s fine they have brown rice too And they serve big portions Great deal decent food and good service 
dAary3x1g3XgXXTiq73aOA CMU I would argue that this is one of the best and most authentic Chinese food in Cambridge Don t go there for the Thai food go there for the Schezwan dishes Basically about 2 years ago they got a whole new menu even though they retained the name Thailand cafe Try the double cooked pork tea smoked duck and the spicy fish 
dAePkfDoxGgGrKO5uqdKow CMU Liked it in high school but so much now Can you say ghetto and not of the ghetto fabulous kind Every girl here seems to be under 18 and every guy here seems to be wayyyyyyy older Gross The food is edible but not the atmosphere 
dAGwrBb9mB34uiEv8oaOMA CMU Here is one dish I really love sweat and sour fish the price is pretty reasonable and service is ok food is of good quality and very authentic Chinese food we once ordered a dish that had a little too much salt and they refunded us without any hesitation this experience made me feel like they are honest businessmen 
DaNGX4wyEc6r4dn_aOqQUg CMU The Kong is The Kong How do you quantify a place like this Let s see The plastic animals on the mysteriously strong scorpion bowls supposedly only 2 3 shots in the large Staff that while not the most patient deal with drunk people incredibly well and incredibly fast service Some food that s delicious if not good scallion pancakes beef chow fun some of the spicy noodle dishes On the other hand Expensive drinks bad idea getting drunk at the Kong good idea being drunk at the Kong A floor so sticky on the 2nd floor you may lose your shoes Drunk guys trying to pick fights outside the door Last thing two years ago I saw a guy in a booth at the Kong lean over vomit all over the floor and then keep on eating Since they renovated the downstairs over the summer I feel like things have gotten a tad classier and for the better 
-d3Hvz2SgQb335VQhINVTA CMU Excellent Chinese food in the Champaign Urbana area Of course the standard American Chinese food is offered but one should try the authentic Sichuan cuisine or even hot pot Fair prices excellent balance of flavor consistently high standards It worth the trip to Lincoln Square mall to eat at this hidden gem 
-hepP8WoOSRAXMRnzaSppQ CMU Cheap Asian food though on the oily side Cravings definitely gets busy during the lunch hours though The owner is a cool guy he knows a ton of Asian languages and dialects Oh yeah don t eat in the restaurant unless you want to go back to class lab smelling like Chinese food 
-srxCNfukfK-bUWY4yr6yA CMU This is my favorite place to eat Chinese food on campus Golden Harbor might have a little bit better tasting food but this is about half the price You can t go wrong with any schezuan beef or brocoli and beef Also I would highly recommend the Dry Chili Chicken off the Chinse menu That dish is amazing 
-SWI5A1QRQnpvOz-L5Aipg CMU Five Star Bubble Tea Ok everyone is right about the food However that is not the prize at Cafe Evo Now listen I recently moved here from Oakland CA The Bay Area knows alot about killer bubble tea with tapioca pearls No one can challenge this But let me tell you something Cafe Evo is the only bubble tea within a two hour drive to Chicago that is worth finding I recommend Banana Taro or Coconut and you have to order it as banana snow with pearls Shake it up before you plunge the straw in and try not to suck it all down in the car before you get back to work I for one have always devoured the whole thing before I can get five minutes back across town Pitiful but incredible Oh and don t expect them to be nice 
-wc4lMVEukP2OvGCW5HXGg CMU A great alternative to Cravings It isn t as busy and you will get your food in under 5 minutes The Chicken Chow Fun is some of the best I ve had 
-YhnjaKlYvUkht9X3EbMkA CMU Peking Garden is a wonderful place excellent for its variety of interesting dishes and pleasant atmosphere I throughly enjoyed my chile chicken fried chicken with chile peppers and a fiery hot sauce which was the spiciest dish I have ever had in a Chinese restaurant The meal ended with fortune cookies and a plate of succulent oranges The service was great and the prices weren t bad either I definitely recommend this restaurant 
-ZG3e6NZxZSd7UYlCE6yPg CMU Went with a large group for a birthday celebration ended up ordering family style Everything was fantastic especially the stick fried tofu and the pork buns Fantastic place to go with a large group but just make sure to bring cash to split the bill Overall the best Chinese food I ve had bar none A bit on the expensive side but well worth the cost 
-_GryYqhVWFZkaZuW_ugwg CMU Food and bubble tea aren t consistent Sometimes it s good and sometimes it s bad 
0n7M9z_CIEpu0KQi4WyOcQ CMU People come here for the bubble tea and hotpot Those are OK but the rest of the food is wildly inconsistent A lot of the food I ve ordered has had an off taste The bubble tea and hotpot would make up for it but they are also quite rude here They won t explain basic things and there have been many instances of people I know getting kicked out because they had finished their food when there were tables free 
0sB7VB3IZpJiHTRpPRfMFg CMU I went with a Chinese friend who ordered in Chinese When one of the dishes arrived and she didn t like the look of it she then shouted a lot at the waiter in Chinese After that the food was exceptional Easily the best Chinese food I ve had in Central Illinois I admit that s a low standard However I ve never been able to recreate this experience And how I ve tried I ended up asking my Chinese friend to write me a note in Chinese ordering these same dishes from the Chinese menu I show the crumpled and worn note to the waiter when I go by myself But the food is never as good I expect it was the shouting Now that my friend has moved away I expect it will never be that good again Without my friend to help us this is a mediocre place 
16x8SW5KTDRjyasR2Q16ag CMU Been here so many times It became one of my to go joint every time I go home from my clinicals Love their Pad thai and Pho The Pho is a little different in this place its has more flavor in it than any other pho I ve tasted probably because of the celery Yes celery Best thai ice tea in town hands down I enjoy their Mongolian beef and Tom Yum soup as well I love the service they serve their food pretty quick The only thing I m concern about is the tray area is a tad filthy and they could ve clean the area more often than leave plates their for some time But who gives a damn they got the best food ever 
1HBrqwCkkUQYiFJn4yWo3g CMU How have i not reviewed Mandarin Wok yet I m a U of I alumni and this was the go to place for chinese peeps who wanted authentic yummy chinese food I know it sounds strange that a school in the middle of corn fields could have excellent chinese food but then again it s an engineering school so you know what that means The fried tofu is SO GOOD here I came back 9 years later for a reunion and the fried tofu was still amazing here If possible order off the mandarin menu and not the english menu or at least say you want the chinese style and not american style dishes yes they make it both ways I live in the bay area now and i still say this is one of the best chinese restaurants I ve had and especially for the midwest Definitely better than most places in Chicago 
1Hvlqjv9JJfEYDEtd6Ut-g CMU I am not Chinese but my boyfriend is and he says this place is close to what his family makes so I believe him That said I ve had a lot of great food here Chen do chili chicken eggplant beef ho fun stir fried bok choy and a fried melon dish are a few of my favorites At first it can be confusing to order and I ve seen a lot of people look overwhelmed by the menu and people milling about the counter I say DON T WALK OUT Ask the lady at the register daughter of chef and she can help you Highly recommend 
1MVFwBqahb4Gon1Qp28vMA CMU It is a terrible regret that I moved away before I had a chance to become a regular at Golden Harbor I ve been there once and the food was out of this world good You can have the americanized staples which are still good or you can get into the real stuff and just have an amazing meal I wish I could pack this place up and take it with me wherever I go It does have an odd cafeteria style service But it s BYOB which I would love to see more restaurants in C U adopt 
1tWrpU9-vPOYP7em0_T-PQ CMU So many lovely memories of going here twice a week at least with my boy We would order strictly from the Korean Menu if memory serves me right intestine shaped like squirrel anyone Excellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment 
22bOyxoN-JSPtFlKsvDhbQ CMU I was excited to try Peking Garden after reading numerous positive reviews from here and other sites I finally had the opportunity to try it out after suggesting it to a roommate over other options Since I ve reviewed another Chinese restaurant and hope to continue doing so I decided it would be best to get the same dish General s Chicken I know this is not traditional Chinese but it is a common dish and is one of my favorites The first difficulty I had with Peking Garden is ordering They do not have a website and it is not easily found online Luckily I was able to find one on campusfood com Next I noticed that the entrees were sort of expensive my dish was 10 90 with tax This isn t too outrageous as the portions were relatively large but there are plenty of other cheaper options in the area After finding the menu and placing the order over the phone I was told it would only be about 10 minutes until our food was ready When we arrived around 10 minutes later our food was waiting for us at the front counter One thing that I did not care for right away was that the rice for both of our orders was included in one container This isn t a huge deal but would have been easier for us had they been separate My meal had pretty good flavor though it wasn t as spicy as other places Despite the flavor both my roommate and I noticed that the chicken was tough to the point it was chewy This is probably the biggest reason for my 3 star rating as almost all other Chinese I have had has been very tender Overall the meal was good but I doubt that I will be returning to Peking Garden anytime soon 
2gWJqidEH2f1NmdRew5HBA CMU This is the worst chinese food I have ever had in my entire life I ordered the sesame chicken combo which came with fried rice egg drop soup and an egg roll The egg roll was fine the egg drop soup was slimy and so thick it seemed like a gravy not a soup The fried rice was your standard rice but the CHICKEN was where I was DISGUSTED It was all fat and gristle cooked beyond the point of recognition and there was hardly any white or dark meat to speak of I ate all of the rice and egg roll one sip of the soup and one piece of chicken A total waste of money I also doubt they could pass any health code inspections because this chicken was NOT chicken 
2nvpDDJb1Zlwai4YARGkfA CMU During weekdays I often stop by Rainbow Garden to pick up food as it has bargain lunch prices and is one of the few options on Neil Street that isn t fast food For around 5 to 6 you can buy a lunch combination meal that consists of a generous portion of your chosen entree rice soup and an eggroll My personal favorites are the chicken and green beans barbecue pork and snow peas and cashew shrimp Some dishes I ve tried in the past have been a little too salty and oily the Szechuan vegetables come to mind but I ve enjoyed most of the dishes I ve ordered Of the Chinese restaurants currently in the Champaign Urbana area I would consider Rainbow Garden to be the best option for a date The outside of the restaurant might seem somewhat unimpressive and grungy but the interior has a very sophisticated atmosphere with white tablecloths and dark red walls By American standards the wait staff might seem rude at times but their cold disposition is considered formal and polite in Chinese culture A previous review complained that the staff is unaccommodating and will not make adjustments to orders However I have previously asked the owners about special items and they have been attentive and considerate of my requests Rainbow Garden has also offered a special menu of delicacies during previous celebrations of Chinese New Year though from what I ve heard they might not be repeating this menu in the future still I think it s worthwhile to check on any potential Chinese New Year specialties 
2xvzpV7vr2Q-Lzafr8hr6Q CMU I ve only ordered through delivery here but so far my experience with this place has been excellent The woman who normally takes my order over the phone also tends to be the person to deliver the food to me She is a sweetheart and when I ordered from a different phone number than I normally do she recognized my address right away when I gave it to her and asked how I was doing What a great memory and way to connect with your customers Now for the food I ve only ordered a couple dishes from here but I feel no need to change my order any time soon Mongolian beef and the General Tso s is the usual First of all I love that they make no questions about making things spicy extra spicy The mongolian beef is ordinarily not spicy but when I asked if they could add some spice they enthusiastically said yes I haven t ordered it unspicy since The beef is sooo tender and the sauce they cook it in is to die for I literally would eat it everyday if I had a heart of steel The General Tso s is pretty good although not outstanding It s a little too sweet and saucy for my taste but I like to have something to contrast the beef so this is usually what I go for The only other dish I ve ordered is the Fried Diced Chicken w Red Pepper It s pretty much a party in your mouth Super spicy just how I like it the chicken is cut up small covered in batter and deep fried almost like popcorn chicken and salty which is awesome with a plain white rice The only reason I don t order this all the time is because it s a little too spicy that I don t want to always regret eating it the next day So I can t speak for a ton of dishes but the ones I ve had thus far have been very palatable And the delivery service is great Woohoo 
2ztAvHzboE76ggv0hBIkOw CMU Very good food lots of interesting choices that are not available anywhere else in town A funky atmosphere and unusual ordering process but the service is fine for what it is Don t eat here if you want the typical sit down with a waiter dining experience and don t eat here if you are unwilling to take a little time to parse the menu They have English translations of it but come with Chinese friends and have more fun figuring it all out 
3-hsH7e0xLT6om8aT5EkfQ CMU I ve eaten here all throughout undergrad and stopped by again this past weekend while visiting campus My absolute favorite dish Indonesian Fried Rice did not disappoint think huge pieces of shrimp and chicken in a bed of delicious seasoned rice with a spicy kick and the perfect runny egg to top it off They have really good authentic Chinese dishes as well Mapo Tofu Crispy Tofu Pork and Bittermelon Three Cup Chicken The owner is incredibly nice and overall the service is very friendly If you are looking for a no fuss place and delish authentic Chinese food or their more American counterparts Cashew Chicken Orange Chicken etc for reasonable prices you ve come to the right place Cravings I love you 
32HO_usYTWH0FKmje4maVw CMU I ordered 3 chinese dishes from this restaurant It was AWFUL The food had no flavor and the meat tasted horrible I ordered authentic Chinese dishes but it was awful I do not recommend at all I couldn t eat two of the dishes and the third one three cup chicken was decent but nothing to write home about 
3b-FgrFl3PaTaodB4WxgSw CMU Great Chinese I think it was a bit over hyped for me and so I was let down a bit but it s better than anything else I ve had in Chambana 
3IX2rHHZD0wDlZu6yencXQ CMU I ve gotten takeout from this place twice now szechuan chicken dinner combo and I must say I have been impressed Not your typical greasy joint although it has the same menu as one the food was cooked to order with good quality chicken and veggies that still had a decent bit of crunch You can sub the egg roll for wonton soup for 85 cents so I did It was yummy and definitely hit the spot The only downside is that the dinner combos are just under 8 bucks which is a bit high but considering the quality I think this will move up in the it s late and I don t have any food at home rotation 
3Neis7EnShcYP2TYmkTp6A CMU Food 5 Price 4 Service 3 Atmosphere 2 
3UpnOtTi5JZhxSoxI4g4rg CMU Went here looking for pho because I was having a huge craving for it It s good beef pho and for a decent price as far as a big bowl goes it was about 8 or so Other than pho they do have a lot of options and the ordering and serving is pretty easy Be wary of when you order though If you are somewhere in between lunch and dinner time I ve had problems with my friends and I getting a lunch portion when we wanted a dinner portion But the portions are fairly priced so that s a plus But the staff is polite and the food is good and they even have dim sum if you have cravings for it like I do 
40sheuPG_BVL6xnIgrFSGw CMU Excellent for the middle of the corn fields I wish this was around back in the day Their sauces are rich and flavorful 
42kDtZKjPVm5sK_oAZ4tEw CMU I love the lunch portion here because it s not too big for me My favorite lunch specials are Crispy Tofu and Broccoli Chicken As for dinner I love Basil Chicken I wish it came in the lunch portion too The only concerns I have at this restaurant are that tables are often dirty and the restaurant setting doesn t creat a relaxing dinning ambiance Will definitely go back 
439tQyJQZBF8uecJNvwMMQ CMU Man I was wary about this place because it looks like every other Chinese food place ever and I don t like most takeout restaurants But it s really really good Sure it s not the swankiest of places but if that bothers you so much take your food to go First of all the guy running the place is so cool I told him I wasn t feeling well and wanted some soup He was like I have JUST the thing Not long after I picked up a huge bowl of soup with big ol chunks of fish cakes squid and shrimp It was a hot and sour seafood soup with noodles and it was nice and spicy At most places when they talk about spicy food it s not really that hot Not so at Cravings I am used to eating spicy food and I was wiping my nose Gross I know Anyway the ingredients taste fresh and the portions are huge They provide water and tea for free which is great when it s cold outside And they give great takeout containers for soups I know it s the little things I ll definitely be back to try more on the extensive menu Hm I wonder if they deliver 
43tErgRSClWiS9AcQch1Iw CMU I miss you Chopstix Since I moved across the country in July I think about your General Tso s tofu on a weekly basis at least Maybe one day I will return and smuggle some onto the plane back Much love 
4AiKkv-nznjIcVJv1VBSHw CMU Thumbs up for the Best Chinese food ever No I am not exaggerating Until I came across Golden Harbor my Chinese food options were just limited to carry out places where I used to more often than not get the Vegetarian Fried Rice and the Vegetarian Spring Rolls but Golden Harbor to me redefined the concept of Chinese Food They have an elaborate menu for Vegetarians which is very unlikely for a Chinese Restaurant and note that none of these Vegetarian dishes contain duck sauce or oyster sauce like most of the other Chinese places The owner is an extremely friendly person who greets you with a smile and explains to you the menu in detail if you have any questions When it comes to orders this restaurant works differently You have plenty of tables to sit and dine but the waiters don t come to take your order As soon as you enter you have a table filled with menus both the American version and the Chinese version a small book and some pens for you to write the order and mark it and give it to the owner at the billing counter The lady then gives you a token for you to take and place it on the table you sit Then the waiters come and deliver the food to your table My personal favorites at this restaurant are Vegetable steamed dumplings and Spicy Hunan Vegetables 
4CzNJgubCoGrxLm0fhe_PA CMU Meh I came in around 19 00 and the buffet was mostly dried up Some bins didn t have anything left but the hostess owner assured me she would make more of whatever I wanted Soups egg drop hot and sour were alright but I think I ll pass on this place next time even though it was super cheap 
4ErN50JI4lDkmkwOduPZUg CMU As far as the authenticity of the food by far the best anywhere in Champaign Urbana wife and I ordered baby squid in basil sauce and the peking pork the squid was cooked perfectly and spiced perfectly The peking pork was fried to perfection and the sauce was very tasty They have updated their menus so that the good stuff can be read in English now Their dim sum is pretty standard items but the only real place to go in Champaign myself I would probably wait till I get back to Chicago for that The down side of this place is their are two waitress that also work in the kitchen everything is self serve the tea drinks even your utensils So do not come here expecting great service but all in all the most authentic chinese restaurant in Champaign 
4Sbc1Ysc2ZLRSEeBYgcBzw CMU Well at least it s cheap Hot Wok serves a purpose It makes food court Chinese seem gourmet by comparison Best part You don t need to get out of your car 
4ZtpwTPyZvwCBONg0n0i-g CMU That giant menu on the wall that you can t read because it s in Chinese just close your eyes and pick something Secret menus always guarantee great food Maybe you re not that adventurous It s ok I don t judge Just make sure you go with an experienced Golden Harbor er or someone that can read Chinese because not everything on their giant menu is listed on the English one Whatever you choose to devour and you will cause this place is DIVINE make sure you don t skip the crispy tofu 10 It is THE best in the world yes capital T H E BEST Not a fan of tofu Eh your loss Try not to crave this place on a Monday I know I know it s hard but don t do it You ll pull up and have your heart broken to see that it s closed on Mondays They also close from 3 4 30pm everyday everyone needs a lunch break y know So plan accordingly UGH SO GOOD 
52O5yB6JxzqxssUy7qEtrA CMU This was one of my favorite Chinese places in C U and it s just a tiny place with a few tables Not expensive at all I think there was a Chinese grandmother in the kitchen lovingly preparing meals to be served but even if not that s how I felt after eating here Good lo mein and more recently they ve added Thai entrees Most dishes are vegetarian 
5aCD166E3za1LQg_7Q1HXw CMU Food tasted authentic Chinese Apparently there are two menus and it seems like most of the complaints are from people given the westernized menu so make sure you ask for the real one One of our orders had a mix up they brought a 30 Peking duck instead of the 10 dish that we wanted the names are very similar However the owner was very nice apologized and asked if we would like to have the 30 dish for 10 instead of having it wasted of course we accepted The place is family run by the owner and her two children all very nice people 
5aqHr3GYu2ANwyw_mRUkdg CMU Yummy 
5kwUmZJPhO2OxJTKRMVzjQ CMU When my fiancee and I went to U of I Evo was one of our favorite restaurants We would go there all the time for delicious bubble tea and Chinese food I was especially found of the House Fried Rice You would think fried rice tastes the same everywhere but the spices that Evo used and the gigantic pieces of chicken and shrimp made it out of this world Fast forward to a few weeks ago We took a trip to see the campus and made sure to stop at Evo Something has really happened to the quality of the food Except for the bubble tea nothing really tasted the same as when we last went to Evo and we were pretty disappointed If we still lived in the area we would still go to Evo for bubble teas and the occasional meal but it would not be the regular restaurant of choice that it once was 
5mc9g55k6Cnd6vma7A6Rwg CMU I was in the Bay Area and missed Golden Harbor An easy five Like being back in China or Chinatown Food first looks second Pay cash GH deserves the devotion it inspires and some of the quirks are real benefits to regulars The price seems to have crept up but there s no tip either so that s fine Dining is meant to be family style large portions so come with a group but call ahead if you might need a larger table 8 If feeling overwhelmed find some foodie friends and sample outside your comfort zone You ll be well rewarded 
5Oo_JNT8aKcOkrI598ZXtQ CMU Best Taiwanese restaurant so far since I came to the states 
5y6CziSts9iX1SF_asBCzw CMU Pretty solid Chinese food This and Mandarin Wok would probably be my favorite Chinese restaurants near campus This location hasn t had much luck with at least 2 or 3 restaurants that have failed here but I think Lai Lai Wok will actually survive for quite awhile 
6DZ4YsM67TFb1n08xPzSHQ CMU My friends and I differentiate between our two favourite Chinese places in C U The really good one Lai Lai and the really fast one Empire Lai Lai is a bit spartan in its set up but if you want a great selection central location and a delicious menu hit it up I think it s ideal for a lunch time meet up with people from the university and the tea dispenser is rather convenient Enjoy 
6pt2Nsij9mC6y8perMsCyA CMU The first thing that strikes many diners at Golden Harbor is the set of rules and practices which differ from American expectations There s a table set aside covered in menus and Guest Check books for you to fill out your own order form Then you queue up and wait to pay If you have questions you are asked not to delay the people behind you to step out of the line Except that the line is never ending so you cannot get your question answered without stalling the line Next only credit cards and checks pay the full bill Cash payers get a 5 discount No tipping is allowed or expected And a new rule as of November 27 2011 they add 50 cents person as a charge for cleaning the table because the former practice of allowing people to clean up after themselves on busy nights and avoid the fee caused spilled sauces and sloppy floors Strange but explainable Lastly a soft drink with unlimited refills costs 2 60 which might be the highest priced soda pop in Champaign County 
6RIVLIP4S00qQTxKC1L_RQ CMU The dim sum here is delicious I ve eaten here with friends before and wasn t too impressed It wasn t until some friends told me about the dim sum that I decided to give this place another chance and it s made me a new believer Definitely recommend the dim sum They serve it EVERY day from 11am 3pm 
73r9tAKnhxc3A3yZbrZWTA CMU What a let down I had my hopes high I like Chinese food but I had been afraid to get it anywhere in Champaign for fear of being disappointed But after reading the menu I thought I d give it a try as it looked authentic enough to me Maybe I ordered the wrong thing Hunan chicken but it was really disappointing bland Chinese American nothing tasty nothing original I took a few bites and threw the rest in the trash I can t believe I m confessing to this Kudos though for the very extensive menu the friendly waitress and staying till 11pm which is rare for Champaign Maybe I ll give it another try 
7dOZ9lW6H148JZrJ7We0sg CMU Best Chinese food in CU Inexpensive plentiful lunch options and relatively quick delivery time make this an excellent choice I typically stick the chicken dishes but the Mooshu sp plates are amazing Once my girlfriend and I went to RG for dinner and about 20 minutes after ordering the waiter came out and apologized for the delay The kitchen had lost our order To apologize the manager brought out a free appetizer and entree On top of that he waived the entire cost of the meal RG really cares about its customers 
7qByDPeOwDdpHEGTui15Iw CMU Judging from its exterior stale yellow wood siding shady parking lot I was sure I d never eat at Golden Wok I was even more suspicious of their advertisement of combined Thai and Chinese cooking However as I passed by one day I noticed that the outside window declared that they served Hainan chicken rice a traditional delicacy rarely mentioned outside of larger urban areas I gave it a try and now I swear by Golden Wok for my Thai cravings Champaign diners go nuts for the pad thai here I m also a fan of this popular noodle dish but for my review I d like to pay homage to another favorite dish from this modest little store the tom kha kai The tom kha kai soup comes in generous portions with lots of chicken soft mushrooms bright chili flakes slices of scallion and a few pieces of ginger and lemongrass shouldn t eat those last two but at least they re testaments to the broth s beautiful flavor Soups at Golden Wok are spooned over jasmine rice instead of noodles This dish easily served as 3 meals for me and is irresistible given its price 7 35 
7wKu5w6coVHZBmEAuk_5lw CMU I love this place Not only does it have fond memories in my heart of high school and college it has great food and great staff The man that owns it is super nice When I used to go with my sister a lot in high school he always gave us a huge smile and said Hi twins The Indonesian fried rice Crispy beef Crunchy Chicken and basically anything on the menu is amazing I love this place 
7Wo0KS_DE9dVOHPujjktrg CMU Outstanding i usually get the american chinese like general tsos sesame chicken etc The jakarta fried rice with tofu and veggies is also amazing Really cheap about 6 bucks for a d lish hot meal I usually try not to eat the whole plate because it is definitely more than one healthy person should eat but i usually can t stop myself couple of types of tea for free while you eat in gets packed during peak times around noon and dinner time so seating can get hard to find but getting it to go and eating at home or outside somewhere works just as well cravings is the go to place for us ae students in the area someone always has it in the lab and always makes me want some actually in all honesty after writing all of this i am walking straight there 
7YqBxnhDHRdEnJUl4HaLAQ CMU Forgot to write a review last week A friend treated me to dinner here I d been here before in the past but seemed to have forgotten about the place It was clean and quiet and the service was prompt and courteous The egg rolls were good My entree was delicious and plentiful Again the house tea was good In all it was a pleasant experience and will be in my rotation of Chinese restaurants 
7ZKpak7KX9C9heOtunYQbg CMU Went here many times with friends while I was down at UofI Good portions at decent prices Wait is a bit long at times but overall a great place to eat if you want to stay close to campus Food is good only gave 4 stars because of wait time 
7_IPU144jeMAIp51FkEENw CMU Best Chinese food in driving range of UIUC Believe the reviews about the crispy tofu it s really that good I ve been here maybe 10 times and have never been disappointed The optimal way to eat here is with a group of 4 or more people so you can share many different dishes I haven t had any bad dishes but some that were particularly good are Crispy tofu of course Basil fried chicken Taiwanese fried chicken and salt and pepper fish If you go on a Friday or Saturday night expect a very long waiting time if you go any time after 6pm It might be difficult to find a table especially if there are 4 people in your party If you plan to go during that time make a reservation 
7_jZW3Dnkvpp4pvt6cLhYw CMU Hmmm maybe I came on an off time because my service was quite good although I was also one of the few tables in here Before I came here for a visit I was looking at a New York yelper s food blog Strangely enough she was talking about where some of the best Chinese food and that it can be found in the strangest of places She mentioned this place I knew I had to stop by to try it I really liked this place Prices were very fair and the portions were just enough to make me full but not stuff me I came here for lunch and had their ginger chicken and asked them to make it extra spicy I started off with their egg drop soup which unlike many that I have had didn t need me to add extra salt My ginger chicken came out for a lunch portion I was very happy with the portion I got filled with veggies a slightly sweet and spicy sauce paired with the fried rice I chose which was just okay For a filled tummy cute although some what hokey decor I left and I was a happy man 
89TNyjJ5Rb3Bx-gKur-jIw CMU Only complaint is my clothes usually smell after I come out of the restaurant Otherwise great place for the price 
8h_f7Hp8zGdfq8dG7xZ7zA CMU I ve eaten at Golden Harbor three times now once for lunch and twice for dinner I went to the restaurant once in Mahomet prior to the move and have not been disappointed by the food at the Champaign location This is the sort of Chinese food that makes you want to eat Chinese every week Most of the dishes are in the 8 12 price range but the portion sizes are generous and the ingredients top quality The ordering system and menu size can be a bit overwhelming we ve consulted with the cashier several times to get recommendations about specific dishes The wait time really varies but even when the restaurant is full dishes tend to come out within 20 30 minutes 
8Mi_HfE6-gVgNwpz8Hf-Xg CMU Before I get into the food I have to say that one of the _greatest_ things about eating here or getting things delivered to go is the service Talk about bend over backwards You want them to do Princess Chicken with sliced carrots and a side of sauce You got it You want your fried noodles with a side of pea shoots and baby won tons You got it Okay wait that last one I might be making up but the first dude I get it every time Alls I m saying is these people will do everything to make your order NAY your EXPERIENCE something awesome And that s a restaurant I can get behind The food is excellent Rice is the perfect consistency not too dry but not wet either Their sauces are incredible try the Princess for a spicy kick or the Empress for something a little spicy sweet Their veg is even good in my book diced or sliced thin not overbearing Everything is just hot and yummy and delicious and my favorite not too hard on the wallet Golden Harbor is located in the old Pickles location trust me a Champaign paragon in its day so it s pretty much central to Champaign Urbana AND Savoy Tell them where you re coming from when you order and they ll make sure the food is separated out in containers that keep things from getting soggy on the way Whether you choose to eat in now that they have the ventilation under control or decide to carry out Golden Harbor Authentic is one of the best Chinese places you can choose in C U 
8q-1YaWHmT4nVqO1kKrw7g CMU When I brought my sesame chicken in to the lab today it was met with a chorus of where did you get that and oh yeah love cravings It s that rare kind of place that has both nasty american super fried chinese food and real actually eaten by some asian people somewhere in asia food And it s dead cheap 
8WEX52YEumjvijMr7eWo1Q CMU Not bad Chinese food at all we came here for Sunday dimsum which was pretty decent Service was decent dim sum was good but there were some dishes that I was a bit disappointed by but the ones that were pretty satisfactory included the spareribs in black bean sauce beef tripe bean curd and the shrimp shui mi Just a tip be careful of which tea that you end up pouring for some reason I ended up with a cup full of hot sugar water And oh yeah they don t take card so make sure that you have cash with you 
8yEeqtJKTmIzX7gP5q-CwQ CMU Mandarin Wok has been hit or miss for me mostly depending on whether I go with a person who can read and order from the real menu or whether I have to order myself from the English menu It s in campustown so I usually never go there unless it s for a departmental luncheon and then I don t have to pay In fact I ve never gone to Man Wok one time when I had to spend my own money I think it is more authentic than any of the other chinese restaurants I have eaten at in champaign But they still serve orange chicken Tonight when I was there I noticed that they have a plasma screen tv in the party room now It was playing a chinese game show Of some sort 
92F1Ayhzi5dvoC9AvpgnjQ CMU I was in town without a car so needed to find something close at hand and had a bit of a cold so wanted soup and something spicy too Rainbow Garden was very good had egg drop soup once not as hot as it would have been as if it had just been made and sizzling rice soup excellent Had spicy seafood white sauce dishes both times both of which were excellent Wait staff very accommodating and friendly 
9c0_VGYwWCjkQRnjssrUPw CMU I like this place I have had lunches dinners and dinners for lunches from here I think the food is good and the portions are good sized When I carryout or have it delivered I don t feel like I m getting skimped My only complaint is the service The people are rude and slow I personally remember a middle aged angry woman and a surly teenager But one of the waitresses draws eyeliner on her eyes to deceive me into thinking she has almond shaped eyes Tricky tricky lady 
9gEvIJn47YqKRGQpIdKuFQ CMU I stopped in for a carry out order and noticed some specials on the board I wasn t familiar with Basil Chicken So I asked the young lady at the counter what was in it She informed me that it was carrots onions chicken and sauce I asked because I do not like green peppers or mushrooms When I get home and sit down to eat I realize that Basil Chicken actually consists of mostly mushrooms and green peppers with chicken basil and chili peppers It didn t even contain carrots or onions Needles to say I was unhappy that I was not served what I was told I was getting I was quite hungry and didn t want to go back out into the cold so I tried to eat some of the chicken Since it was their mistake I figured they would make it right I called to complain The young lady told me that I should just pick the mushrooms and peppers out I explained that the dish was mostly mushrooms and peppers and I asked for a refund She informed me that since I had already eaten some of it that they wouldn t be able to serve it to someone else Yikes I sure hope that they don t re sell food that customers have taken home with them After this exchange I offered her the option of refunding my money or permanently loosing me as a customer She replied I don t care and hung up on me At no point during this call did she apologize for her errors in describing what I was ordering We all make mistakes sometimes but when it happens you should try to make it right I wont be going back 
9iPwNjWNXZjOvtQ15pakzw CMU We work on campus and typically have lunch at Rainbow Garden once a week Tuesday is Rainbow Day Over the past 3 4 years there has been some variation in the quality of the food from only modest to very very good For the past year though very good to excellent has been the rule with good portions Strongly recommend as one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area as do most of the reviewers Don t believe some of the whiney reviewers on this site It s a Chinese restaurant for God s sake You were expecting gourmet dining 
9MsuChqCHhtwgOAm_K83HQ CMU Best crab rangoon EVER I made SURE to stop at Empire while in CU because I was dreaming about their crab rangoons 3 gets you 6 Complete steal Empire also finally takes cc s but there s lame 8 min 
9nYEFoFjEFHQK80xGl3RMg CMU i ve also found it wildly difficult to have a pleasant experience at evo if you cannot speak chinese i ve been to evo twice once for the bubble tea and once for a spot of garlic chicken unfortunately nothing i ve tried was tasty enough to compensate for the lackluster service 
9rasIiqFcJ-6BEXkUPShxw CMU On a college students budget this place is a mecca for getting a full stomach For about six bucks I can get orange chicken with rice at excellent quality not to mention that the portions are huge which is a fantastic quality Only downside is a long wait during peak hours 
9VcEH34MI4DawbdfW_uPhA CMU Unequivocally the best tasting Chinese food in town Though recently it seems a bit understaffed The interior and the ordering system are both very utilitarian Bottom line if you want great cheap and usually fast Chinese food go here If you want any kind of ambiance or a quiet atmosphere go elsewhere highlights excellent food the ordering system allows you to sit in but not tip pretty cheap can get very crowded and loud For what it s worth my Chinese classmate said it was the best Chinese place in town famous for crispy tofu 
9vpbf4zHH0KDXvU5uX-twg CMU As much as I love my Chinese heritage I will not dishonor it by writing a good review about Bo Bo China Let me put it this way I have eaten here about 3 times in the past four years and after my last time well it is going to stay the last time I ordered a spicy chicken with fried rice combo which arrived in a hour to my workplace Since it was busy i was only able to eat 1 3rd of it The next day at home I heated up another third of it And finally on Sunday I ate the final third AS I WAS FINISHING THE LAST COUPLE OF BITES I FOUND A COCKROACH IN IT AUGHHHH The cockroach had been cooked with the dish and I guess settled with the sauce to the bottom of the takeout box I had a moment where I thought I should be vomiting uncontrollably But thanks to my superb nerves of steel i calmly spit out the food I had been chewing and proceeded to scrub my mouth out Dry heaves ensued I am never eating here again I am one to hate asian stereotypes about subpar kitchen cleanliness but this one takes the cake Honestly A cockroach Sigh 
9yhgpZXj7zRC7KdpSzPGWg CMU Lai Lai Wok has a lot of the standard fare you often encounter in Chinese restaurants such as sweet and sour chicken However it has large enough selection that I prefer it to many other Chinese restaurants in the area there are lots Don t order what you know branch out here it s worth it I would note their menu has an unspoken distinction between the Westernized and more authentic items which is easy to find simply note there are two chicken sections and the Westernized contains the familiar items like Kung Pao and Sesame Try the other section What keeps me coming back is the Taiwanese Salt and Pepper chicken I randomly ordered off the authentic section of the menu It s crispy pieces of peppery chicken fried in ginger It s wonderful and unlike anything I ve ever had The atmosphere is nothing special and the tea isn t as good as Mandarin Wok s but the menu makes it worth it 
9_vB15gQJF1XS_II2RIJIA CMU Good fresh tasty abundant good value Say Hi to Micky 
A-fU6d4YW4vM86Q4hh1ysQ CMU authentic good Chinese food in the Midwest You don t come here for the service or the ambiance You come here for the food and the food here is REALLY good 
aa0eVmUS4IMWN2Yepk2RQw CMU Reasons for going there almost every week 1 Close to my classes 2 Staff are nice 3 Food is good but some of the dishes are just not so tasty as I expected But I ll just order the ones I like But during lunch dinner hours the line can get really long So I usually go there between 2 5pm so that I can get the food within just 10mins or less 
aBiyZzryN8lpvcLhNe0Hcg CMU I went here on a Tuesday afternoon at about 5PM I was the only one in the restaurant and there was only one hostess that had to juggle answering the phone serving me and helping people picking up take out orders It went smooth enough though and my order came fast within minutes I ordered the chicken with green beans one of my favorite Chinese dishes back home Unfortunately it s hard to believe I m saying this but the dish was completely tasteless In fact the only thing I could taste was the oil and oil does not taste too good The dish just seemed to be poorly cut chicken and old green beans tossed in some cooking oil and stir fried There was a little soy sauce but it did nothing to add to the flavor and only added to the color All and all the place is nice inside and for only one waiter the service was good Unfortunately the food was extremely bland and I will not be going here again I probably could have done better at home 
ablNmujGblD_EsVZr2zLOA CMU I m not exaggerating This is the best Chinese restaurant in central if not the entire state of Illinois When you walk in all you see are Chinese people laughing and having a good time The entire menu is in Chinese so you either have to remember the number or have a local that can read the menu here I was skeptical at first when someone told me that this was the best Chinese food After one bite of their crispy tofu I shed a little tear of joy and just kept eating 
AGUUEsOdjOjJf0DxNCZhHg CMU Good food The Thai Basil Green Beans are a favorite of mine The ordering system is a bit convoluted and be sure to come when it isn t busy 
AkbxN_1LHK64reCEngFVPQ CMU It s good for both groups as well as for a couple of friends and fairly priced too The food here I have found to be consistently good It s not overly greasy as most Americanized Chinese food joints are and I love coming here on a cold day for a big bowl of beef noodle stew Remember that whole curse about this location How a restaurant had never been able to last there for more than a year Well Lai Lai definitely proved everyone wrong and is still going strong They re pretty hands off here If you would like more tea or water get up and get it yourself If you re in a rush to pay the check walk it up to the front and get it rung up Overall I much prefer not being all fussed over during my meals so this works for me As everyone else is recommending their tofu both mapo and home style are very yummy Actually everything I ve had here is very good Going back again soon 
AlSmnWk7mjZFOfDBi7zS_g CMU I realize that the standards for Chinese food in this town are extreeeemely low However the fact this joint has such a high yelp rating leaves me distressed over the taste buds of my fellow yelpers Fried rice fairly standard right I ve never had such a horrible and disgusting excuse for fried rice There was nothing in it No bits of egg no meat no shreds of carrot no scallion no onion no peas Nothing A scoop full of sticky brown ish rice It smelled like cardboard and had no discernible flavor Just rice doused with soy sauce Effing gross The chicken did not taste like General Tso It was like they added a tad of soy sauce to the sweet n sour It was not spicy It was not flavorful And the meat itself Dry tough stringy chewy The rangoon were filled with cream cheese but they didn t seem to have any crab This place blows 
aMvWkIDQKiY3trMfdL9Flg CMU Best place for fast Chinese food I like the ho fun mee go reng and singapore noodles They are open really late and deliver 
An56_HAqICq_e8xKQ-ja2w CMU I really love this family owned ran business I ve been in Champaign for several years and whenever I need my Chinese food fix I know exactly where to go I love the general s or Orange Chicken I m not a huge fan of their yellow fried rice but it s a price I can pay for the deliciously cooked chicken and at home atmosphere I feel 
Aoh4DfkvgACGt4JhAQGHHA CMU I ve only tried 2 dishes here so far but they were so sub par it s iffy whether another chance here will be taken Even for a cheap Chinese place the atmo leaves much to be desired And I m not at all fussy about that My friend had a tofu dish that was ok Tasted like BBQ sauce mixed with teriyake Should ve tried the dumplings myself was all set to do so after reading reviews here But I wasn t in the mood for meat So I got the veggie lo mein It s not a difficult dish and I ve pretty much never gotten a bad version Until here Bland boring and worst of all super greasy It felt like oil slicks in my mouth Arrgh Why It was like being served greasy coffee one of those things that totally mystify and leave you wondering what the hell the chef was up to back there 
AoOsAQwQZWESgjIAGwY0SA CMU My favorite Chinese place to get lunch in Champaign Tasty fresh tasting dishes with good sauces and I m a sucker for a good sauce Their affordable lunch dishes come with cup of soup egg roll and well proportioned meal I also really appreciate their service The owner is very friendly and the waiter will usually remember what we ordered and ask if we would like it again Great place 
aqmBx3xvM987eBaHw5ci5Q CMU For years I lived a block from this little unsuspecting restaurant and I always passed it by because I thought it was just another greasy counter serving your average Chinese fare If you walk into Peking Garden and they hand you that menu with the classic Americanized dishes General Tso s chicken lo mien fried rice etc tell them that you actually want to see the menu with the traditional true blue Chinese dishes squid sea cucumber etc Unfortunately I can t vouch for the Americanized food items as I ve never tasted them However there IS just one thing that makes this restaurant GOLDEN in my book Peking Garden is the ONLY Chinese restaurant in the Champaign Urbana area to my knowledge where you can eat a very specific type of traditional Chinese cuisine called hot pot sometimes called shabu shabu in Japanese restaurants If you ve never eaten hot pot before let me explain the general idea a portable stove and miniature pot of boiling broth will be brought to your table You will also be given plates of raw vegetables meat and noodles You toss whatever you want to eat into the pot wait a few minutes and then start serving the soup from your table Definitely a treat during winter months and worth a try for adventurous diners I haven t tried too many other dishes here but I did order dumplings once and have been requesting them on visits ever since Usually most Asian restaurants even the Chinese ones sell what I consider Japanese or Korean dumplings The outside dough is paper thin indicating that the dumplings were probably bought frozen instead of prepared in store At Peking Garden the dumpling dough is thick and chewy the way Chinese dumplings are SUPPOSED to be The meat filling is still a little plain just ground pork and a few carrots nothing special but the dough wrappers are FO REAL The interior decor is that faded 80s look that seems to plague a lot of the restaurants in this area You can t really tell if the evening mood lighting is actually mood lighting or if they just didn t bother to fix some broken bulbs I wouldn t recommend this place for a romantic rendezvous but it could be fun for friends eating in large groups Everybody loves Lai Lai or Golden Harbor and while the menus at those restaurants are a good deal larger Peking Garden does have its own unique specialty the hot pot If you re not sure what to do when you get there stare at the tables of Chinese diners follow their lead and you won t be disappointed 
Ass4gjbw0MCToOD2hYnUSA CMU After having recently relocated to Champaign from Northern CA I despaired of finding good let alone palatable Chinese food My first few forays into the local cuisine were worrisome Eating at Golden Harbor was like a parting of the clouds everything I ordered was top notch My friend and I sampled several dishes pork seafood noodles and all were quite tasty Five stars for food three stars for environment solid 4 star option 6 stars if you are only considering Champaign Urbana 
AUhUU0dwmm9UbmKlqAOHxA CMU We ve lived in the Champaign area for about 6yrs now and since then I ve had a love hate relationship with this restaurant They have a huuuuge menu very similar to Golden Harbor who were the original owners of this place for those of you who are interested in Tina s Chinese restaurant entrepreneurial endeavors of Champaign I think she started with Cravings then to Mandarin Wok then to The Wok then to Golden Harbor and of course some other restaurants in between probably Anyways you walk in figure out what you want from the 300 item menu score another biggie if you know how to read the Chinese menu then write down your order and sit and wait for the food to come out This is the only place in town that serves dim sum and I LOVE dim sum The quality of dim sum has varied over the years and at one point I was so angry for waiting for at least 40minutes for mediocre dim sum that I didn t come back for two years But that was then and this is now went in the other week and knew that I would be kicking myself for not driving up to Chicago for dim sum but I was craving hargow and shui mai so bad I just found out I was pregnant so when a pregnancy craving kicks in watch out that I figured I d eat here just to get the taste I ordered har gow shui mai shrimp spring rolls and beef balls Total came to about 13 I m never sure about the tipping policy here but I m sort of going after what Tina does at Golden Harbor and not tip because you basically have to bus your own tables and there s a sign that says no tip required Anyways I was pleasantly surprised that my first dish was out in about five minutes har gow they were a little on the small side key lime size but holy cow were they good Then the shui mai comes out same thing wow Then the spring rolls and beef balls yummy yummy I couldn t believe it it wasn t the best I ve had but they hit the spot and I didn t feel like I had a lump in my stomach afterwards Just to be sure I went back the other day and same thing Everything was yummy and fairly fast I love dim sum and am glad that for the time being that it s really happening at Mandarin Wok a little on the pricey side for dim sum but rather than spending 5hrs of drive time 50 in gas and parking it s better to stay in Champaign for the next little while HOORAY 
AYYX8NvDyTiRNf-g4-Zp8Q CMU Alright food alright drinks Not really a place I d stop by for gourmet food but still pretty okay I m not a fan of making drinks from syrups or powders but it is challenging to keep a full stock of fresh fruits and vegetables when smoothies aren t incredibly popular in America yet 
b5Q4V2Tq8KptG9-xZCdX0w CMU Ah Cravings My old stand by Chinese place Good food at a good price They have both the typical Chinese fare that most Americans are used to and a pretty full true Chinese menu Orange chicken is really good so is the Mongolian beef The only thing I ve been disappointed in there is the veggie egg rolls 
b9A4wS3h3n845TsNH6JYdg CMU Very friendly folks here and the food is super 
bDoME5t4qeudMAUHv8ZvJg CMU Again caveat lector I don t like Chinese food very much or very often After my last excursion for Chinese I ve become a brand loyalist to Golden Harbor Unfortunately for me G H was packed like sardines tonight Thus it was Rainbow Garden and perhaps we should chalk it up to my perpetually low expectations for Chinese but I actually enjoyed this place It s fairly reasonably priced the decor is nice i e not a whole in the wall and unlike G H it s more of a traditional restaurant service experience Where Rainbow Garden is scoring most of its points is that as some of the other reviews have noted the service was fantastic By that I mean we had food within 10 minutes of ordering it and glasses that never really got empty The food was good I suppose I liked it enough I d come back I wish they gave me some more rice though I like a lot of rice 
bEKyxn_CCwxEcmeuA-8Y9w CMU Stopped by Empire yesterday for some quick takeout Pros Friendly service order was ready pretty quickly meals were cheap plenty of food for three people for 13 and change walls were freshly painted in bright colors napkins sauces forks etc were fully stocked and clean Cons Decor was sort of confusing and borderline gross We wondered what had been living in the empty fishtank near the door Mix of Chinese language and Champaign newspapers scattered all around the seating area walls postered in a million different menu items The biggest con however The food My friends got sweet and sour chicken They said it was alright The fried rice was BRIGHT yellow almost saffron y in color Unnatural The egg roll was disappointing I had the pork with string beans a k a green beans and white rice The pork wasn t terrible and the beans were passable but it was all covered in this hideous teriyaki shoyu sauce There was SO much MSG that I ended up with a horrible migraine later in the evening I anticipate that any especially cheap Chinese food in the area will contain at least some MSG but this was just over the top Considering the number of good to amazing Chinese restaurants within a 2 mile radius of campus Golden Harbor Lai Lai Wok Rainbow Garden etc I won t be going back to Empire 
bgUKVL-7NTFKgQ4Krnx0zA CMU When my brother and sister in law who is Taiwanese visited recently we made the very great decision to let her order for all of us off of the secret menu If you visit Peking Garden s website they call it the Exotic Menu Nothing that I d gotten off the menu for whitey had been bad mind you but the real deal stuff was awesome In addition to Sizzling Rice Soup Deep Fried Shrimp whole and Twice Cooked Pork we were treated to Stir Fried Lamb with Ziran and Bean Leaves in Garlic Sauce The Ziran sauce was sweet maybe reminiscent of cinnamon and unlike anything I d tasted in Chinese cuisine before The Bean Leaves were vibrantly green tender not soggy and studded with garlic cloves AMAZING I still have not had their giant alcoholic drinks but I want to I just want to have a cocktail big enough for two people while munching on bean leaves and garlic cloves Is that too much to ask 
bHc7sXq1-OqGfG17uCoYHQ CMU This place is the best chinese place in Champaign It is great and they take credit cards It is very standard chinese food and very clean They even sweep the sidewalk outside the restaurant on green street and there is no outside seating I cannot tell you how many times I have the chicken fried rice a week They also have free green tea It s a little sad 
Bi80jz4KYo1xNS6CQ4ipxw CMU Golden Wok is one of those small niche restaurants in Champaign It doesn t get a huge amount of foot traffic through it and is located on the border of one of the sketchier areas in Champaign but the food is good for what you pay for A typical entree might be 8 9 which is expensive for Champaign IMO But you also do get lots of food My favorite dish here is Beef Pad See Ewe which is the long noodles with broccoli bok choy and beef Put a little siracha sauce on it and you have a really tasty dish The restaurant is family owned and they seem to be there all the time They are really good about phone orders and being fairly quick about bringing dishes out though sometimes they might forget something You just have to have thick skin when going into the place because you might not get the best service The downside of this place is that it just seems a little bit dirty The tables are a bit grimey even after they wipe them down And you have to clean up everything yourself But the family is super nice and the food is good and there really is no Thai place like it in the Champaign Urbana area Other popular dishes I see people get are Pad Thai Red Curry Green Curry I give it 3 5 stars but not enough to round up to 4 on the food alone 
biSupdyvzfzsGXf8wGtzdQ CMU I was pleasantly surprised The other two Thai restaurants in the area which I have eaten at were closed so I decided to give the Golden Wok a try due to its good reviews on yelp This place is really easy to miss because it is a tiny building that does not look anything like a Thai restaurant The restaurant was completely empty when we got there but while we were eating there was a steady stream of people coming in to order take out We ordered the Tom Yun Koong Yum Nuau and Jungle Curry Tom Yun Koong is a soup that is exactly the same as the traditional Tom Yum soup found at all Thai restaurants and it came with shrimp The soup was delicious but definitely not the best I have ever had It had the prefect amount of heat the shrimp were not overcooked and the vegetables were nice and crispy Yum Nuau is a spicy beef salad I always order this dish when i go to a Thai restaurant and I have to admit that this salad had some sort of different spice which was very tasty Again it was not the best I have ever had but it was deliciously unique All the vegetables in the salad were super fresh and the quality of the beef was excellent Jungle Curry was very confusing though It came in a big bowl with a ton of fresh vegetables and wonderfully seasoned chicken but the sauce was some sort of chicken broth with seasonings I thought that they brought me the wrong dish but sure enough it was the Jungle curry that I had ordered This was the first time I was served a curry dish which did not consist of coconut milk It was very tasty though and I was not disappointed that I ordered it In the future I will definitely always ask for the ingredients in the dish before I order it One other complaint was that the menus are very simple and do not have pictures or any sort of description of the dishes This would be nice but not a big huge deal The service was excellent and the people working there are very friendly I would definitely recommend this place 
borq8bpSL9QIlFnG8To2nw CMU Food is great service is great staff is great Chinese Food is one of my favorite cuisines and I ve tried many place locally as well as out of town this is one of the best There is one other place locally that I love almost as much but the food is there is prepared Cafeteria Style But very well seasoned One Wok Food is prepared as order and some items could use a little more seasoning The Restaurant has a open kitchen so you can see that it is clean and watch as your food is being prepare I have never been in there when I wasn t greeted with a friendly and warm hello and a smile no matter how busy they are Most of the time I call in my order and it s always ready when promised The price match the quantity 
bpVCpTSxt8PnqEe6t0lKDA CMU I wish I could import this restaurant to Hyde Park so I can have Cravings whenever I don t feel like cooking Its the cheap but great Chinese eatery brought to life with low low prices order at counter big heaping portions free tea in styrofoam cups etc Staff is really friendly and the dishes we tried were pretty good too Try the chili chicken and the eggplant 
bQeJB5D0WELssyrMUPAlkQ CMU Seriously some of the best Chinese I ve had Just as good if not better than Chopstix in Gainesville FL This place seems pretty authentic I got the Taiwanese style salt and pepper chicken It was so tasty I could hardly stop eating it I had plenty of leftovers and ate it twice for dinner but the portion could ve easily served three The only reason this gets four stars is that it upset my stomach the two days I ate it But it was so good that I will definitely get food here next time I am wanting chinese 
bQlNNupol5KpA1AGZzwhaQ CMU Best chinese food Ever No make that Best Chinese Vegetarian food Ever I m a big fan of chinese food and when I have my cravings I usually have to settle for places that have limited vegetarian options and greasy stir fry that tastes suspiciously like it has duck sauce or oyster sauce Not Golden Harbor though The vegetarian menu option runs in pages Literally Well first off there are two menus to choose from one is the American menu and the other is the Chinese menu Both have lots of options in tofu eggplant and vegetables There is a super friendly and a sweet lady who is also the owner up in the front who processess your orders and you can ask her any question about the dish she will take her time to explain it to you and what it has She also makes sure that the kitchen caters to your vegan vegetarian needs Once the kitchen messed up our order and we got all meat stuff When we went back to tell her that it was not what we ordered she was so apologetic threw in an order of steamed vegetable dumplings for free and personally made sure that we got our right order this time Making good food is one thing but being so customer friendly and personal for a popular restaurant is another Having been to many popular restaurants with bad service and arrogant owners I will easily give this place 5 starts and more My personal recommendation steamed vegetable dumplings There are 8 pieces in total and make excellent starter The outer coat is thin and less chewy unlike other places where the outer shell is so chewy and thick If you are a vegetarian and in the C U area I would highly recommend this place 
bs9h0alvmlfpUR3Ex8wTWg CMU My fiance s best friend is off the boat from thailand and knows the best little asian restaurants When we were in town visiting him he took us here on the way to a movie just for a quick bite to eat Huge portions and very low prices It seems like a family owned business and they put their heart and soul into serving the customer I wish more places like this existed 
BTnZ3hufxH_g8_EiyHVLJg CMU If I could give negative stars I would Order 1 for delivery Never got it After calling the restaurant the owner kept saying 5 minutes Never did receive the order Order 2 for delivery WRONG ORDER I had a craving and decided to give them another chance After waiting 1 hour I called and got my food about 10 minutes later The only problem was that it was NOT my food I believe I m done with them Back to Chopstix I go UPDATE Owner called me 2 1 2 hours after my order and says that before refunding my money they are going to come and pick up the food 1 I did NOT eat the food 2 I put it in my trash can 3 They want to make sure that they get everything back before refunding Then she tried to tell me that I owe 12 more For what So I can have my initial order recooked LOL Sorry guys but I ate dinner an hour ago So they are on their way to pick up the food that I did not touch and put in the trash can so they can reimburse me Interesting business strategy 
bXgnDXmODXcxIWwhKizPWA CMU Simple but good chinese food Recommend sezchuan or hunan chicken dishes However very busy at peak meal times so plan wisely 
BygEbjNBINdgO0DxZhXcIQ CMU It s always fun to come here with a big group While they offer dim sum here which is something you can t find anywhere else around Champaign a word of caution their dim sum isn t all that great For the more authentic dishes go with the ones hand written in Chinese on the walls If you re not sure what it is don t hesitate to ask the owners plus you could always close your eyes point at a random dish on the wall and see what surprise arrives at your table I suggest trying this only if you don t have food allergies P While they do have lunch specials here the dishes tend to be over Americanized like orange sweet sour chicken general tsao s etc but cheap As a tip the owners stock their kitchen on Mondays so for the freshest ingredients try Mandarin on a Tuesday Of course that s not to say that their food is any less on other days If you come here often enough and get to know the owners they often throw in an extra dish or two for free Mandarin Wok reminds me of the Chinese restaurants back home 
B_7NlJhU3A7oGVnGGevNSw CMU A chowhound sort of place HOG has some good food and some horrible food The problem is that the menu is so undecipherable that it s hard to make good choices Word of mouth is the only way to go here When I went the luck route I ended up with Tom Yum that seemed to contain pieces of wood When I relented to a friend s suggestion I had the most wonderful savory cumin beef with cilantro Not so great ingredients and they skimp on some major components of dishes the pad thai looks like noodles with some sauce and meat and nothing else but occasionally you can get good things here 
C6KD-GyNvQsM49Cpzgy0bg CMU Best Chinese in CU by far Was recommended by a Chinese friend as the place to go and I was not disappointed by the food They recently added waitstaff to their payroll which seemed to detract from the experience as the table service was weak and I waited a very long time for my check 
c8LkyA8cqtRvma5J7pH4Jw CMU I used to walk past this place all the time for the last 3 years and finally had the opportunity to come here with my boyfriend We were craving pho and normally we go to Cravings for that but he had come here with his boss and swore it was better here Noting the couple in front of us eating the beef version of pho I got excited We ordered the seafood pho When it came I noticed there was something immediately wrong the noodles looked suspiciously like Top Ramen egg noodles instead of rice noodles but I dug in cos I was so hungry My boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different It also had no garnish bean sprouts basil no lime and there was no oil that normally comes in the soup When we inquired the lack of garnish or lime we were informed by a very nervous waitress that our pho was special We then asked for srirarcha sp and got a tiny dollop of it All in all we paid 16 for beef Top Ramen with seafood floating in it It was very salty and unpleasant I felt disgusted that I actually ate half since I was so hungry Multiple theories as to why we were treated this way The couple in front of us had the beef pho and it had the garnish and the lime oil and rice noodles 1 We didn t look Asian enough I m Filipino Italian look at my profile picture and my boy is Filipino but could pass for Latino sometimes They were too cheap to serve us the real thing or thought they could get away with serving us the ramen since we didn t know any better anyway 2 They were out of ingredients and were too lazy to bother telling us and offer alternatives or a refund 3 A combination of number 1 and 2 I guess it serves us right for going into a Chinese restaurant for pho but Cravings serves multiple Asian dishes as well and they got it right What made us the most angry is the fact that the Asian couple in front of us got exactly what they wanted and we left unsatisfied My boy swears he got good soup there but his boss is more Asian looking and could be the reason why they got it right NEVER AGAIN STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE 
c8QIHcbxAGx_AmVmK3y2HA CMU The food is delicious by far the best Chinese food in central illinois I have been twice once for takeout and once seated I always go with my Chinese friends they are never hard to convince because the food is so good There are a number of dishes that I love but I don t really know the names I have them written down in Chinese but more often than not I just ask my friends to pick something I ve never been let down The employees at the register are also very helpful in finding something to suit your palette There s never a shortage of spicy food at my table The full menu is available as an English menu as well The staff also provides a free item as well If you order 4 entrees you will get 5 dishes maybe an appetizer maybe an entree Keep in mind you go here for the food The atmosphere is simple Large room lots of tables But you just cant beat the food at any other Chinese restaurant in the area The chef and owner has a tradition of establishing excellent restaurants in the area They previously ran Mandarin Wok later started the Wok in Mahomet and are now moving back to Champaign 
caLTHVdSuHZ-Kp7P5Sbtuw CMU Food was priced average 8 12 and my order came quick This place is more of a counter order restaurant so it s almost serve yourself Anyway my order came very fast within a few minutes The veggie and sauce mix was really tasty but the meat I ordered a chicken dish was not too good In fact it tasted like turkey I probably will not go here again Also the workers have a hard time speaking English It was hard to understand them and I was note sure my order was being communicated correctly to them The restaurant is also really tiny Don t let it scare you away though Try it out it might suit your fancy 
cfDtZFB8qCDC38E3r-Lyag CMU I don t actually attend U of I or live close but I totally would so that I could eat at this place every day Best orange chicken I ve had in my LIFE And you know I m credible because I m Asian American so you can imagine all the shitty ass orange chicken dishes I ve had At other places there is always a problem with the orange chicken If it isn t because the sauce is too sweet and syrupy it s because there s too much breading on the chicken Sometimes I just feel like I m chewing on soggy fried breading with no chicken in it BUT Lai Lai s orange chicken is inarguably the best orange chicken I ve ever tried Everything is perfect about it and I could probably eat it for years if not decades Everything else I ve tried is delicious as well but their orange chicken is just amazing 
CISxPBTOduqIOFey9WWscg CMU I have eaten at Hot Wok for many years now and I will keep going back The portion size for what you pay is wonderful You often get two meals for the price of one and paying the little bit extra for two different toppings is well worth it Two of the best days are Tuesday for Beef Curry Day and Fridays for Coconut Shrimp Day Both of these are excellent and worth saving a special day to have The regular dishes are great too I love the chicken and green beans the General s chicken and cashew chicken Going around a set meal time will ensure you always have fresh food However this place isn t one to let lots of food sit around so even at an off time you are going to get something made pretty new 
cNS3tcbskyNsK2CatwreaA CMU Y know how sometimes in life we learn lessons in our heads but it never really hits home until much later The mantra of never judge a book by its cover became real to me the first time I dined at Golden Wok It was a scene worthy of a movie dramatic music slow mo closeups of pad thai flying everywhere and fat tears of epiphany rolling down my cheeks to salt up my food Not that the food needed any more salt or additional seasoning anyway In direct contrast to the squat one could even go so far as to call it ugly exterior the dishes are pure decadence in your mouth Yes the pad thai is awesome but people let s stroll down some paths less taken shall we Pad see ew is also good though in my opinion perhaps a bit too much sauce My favorites would have to be the Golden Fried Rice offered only on their Shining White Board of Specials and the Beef Noodle Soup The Golden Fried Rice is curried pineappled raisined egged goodness Sounds weird but the lesson here is never judge a book by its cover remember The Beef Noodle Soup is perhaps a direct cousin of Vietnamese pho I ve never been quite sure whether to go ahead and give it the pho label because it just never seems quite pho y enough But irregardless of labels its exactly what I find myself ordering when it s blizzarding and I just want some hot broth and flavorful noodles to fill me up The curries are also excellent Hell just go ahead and order everything I m pretty sure you can t lose Could it get any better Why yes it can rhetorical question asker With giant portion sizes Unless you re of the same breed as some of my male bottomless pit friends be prepared for leftovers Advice noobs should go with an experienced G Woker It s a hidden gem emphasis on hidden 
cR3bg1gmwqXaTSLUt3gU5Q CMU Pretty good for carryout food is usually ready in 15 20 minutes The portions are OK and I find the food a bit oily but very tasty though certainly not gourmet Prices a little on the high side but not horrible I have been here once to eat in and it was a nightmare We were there for over 2 hours when we finally left having not yet been served our entrees Appetizers had been served about 45 minutes after ordering them but they were cold and soggy You could not pay me to eat in again but I m content to get carry out from here every couple months when I have a craving for greasy Chinese food since it is right near where I work Admittedly though Hot Wok is a better value and probably where I would go if there was one closer to my home or work 
cuwGkOMcpFUFUiFK9ZWCXA CMU This place deserves 5 stars every time I pass by this place I want to eat here Only problem is their same dishes taste differently each time so one need to make sure what he wants The owner speaks many languages hence is pretty funny 
cXP5QJbX_GcrXuzIgm4YGQ CMU I don t live in Champaign anymore but I come back to eat here It s of course a no frills plastic fork kind of place but if you order off their Chinese menu you will not be disappointed Their Spicy Pig Intestine stew is probably the best dish I have ever eaten Every time I go I take an order with me When I am eating it in Chicago it is so good it makes me want to move back C U has always had better asian food than Chicago but this dish and it s always a little different sends me to the moon I can t speak for their Sesame Chicken or their Egg Foo Young and if I was as talented as the person in that kitchen I would be insulted seeing that kind of order come up That being said they should probably alter the ambience but hell they are mainly existing to serve Chinese students who want authentic chinese food not people who want a fine dining experience As long as that dish stays good I will always come back They have wonderful food and I like that the prices are lower because there are no waiters or flatware I would pay 30 dollars for the Intestine dish I am glad I can still get it for 12 
CYbZTh-AhAOepZGFvao50Q CMU I ordered for delivery on campusfood com No complaints on this end the food was quick and delivery was only 1 However the food left a lot to be desired I ordered General Tso s tofu with fried rice Being vegan I requested the fried rice to not include egg and they obliged However it seems egg is the only thing they put in their fried rice because I basically got white rice that tasted really really funky I ve never gone to a Chinese food restaurant and had this experience The General Tso s tofu had an incredibly liquidy no I won t stay on your broccoli sauce which in my experience is abnormal as I have a bit of a General Tso s sauce obsession but the tofu was alright It just really wasn t very good at all I definitely won t be coming back here Certainly not after experiencing the pleasurable dining experience I had at Peking Garden 
cZZLO3yAlZ1eK10MFGBqSw CMU I took my parents They both seemed to like it My mother raved about her entr e which I believe was beef fried rice She also enjoyed the fried pot stickers though they weren t all that thoroughly fried obviously steamed and then quickly fried on one side I wasn t too hungry and just had the crispy tofu which was excellent as many others have said Held up well the next day for lunch too We ordered a mix of things from the translated menu and the American menu I didn t find the order process to be complex even as a first timer Grab a menu find what you want write it on a piece of paper go up to the counter Not rocket science We grabbed a table first which made things a bit easier 
c_5CW8JPWMNQO8LgfFFcUg CMU After coming back here for the pho Vietnamese noodles I have to upgrade the rating to 4 5 stars or basically rounded up to 5 Hungover after a night a the bars the gf recommended grabbing pho at Mandarin Wok I never even knew that this super Chinese restaurant would offer Vietnamese noodles let alone if it was authentic or not Surprise Surprise The pho was EXCELLENT Far exceeding the likes of legitimate Vietnamese establishments in the Champaign Urbana area I would venture to say that it rivals the pho I get back home in the San Francisco Bay Area but that s probably because my pho addicted brain craves any substitute although the Yelper in me looks for quality and authenticity Soup base was flavorful noodles chewy meat offering varied and delicious And they even bring the bean sprouts herbs and jalapeno slices You will not be disappointed coming here for a hot steaming bowl of pho If you ve never had pho in your life consider trying it at Mandarin Wok a first step to something incredible Caveat only order the beef pho as according to another Yelper the seafood pho is whack 
d6XSEmrLzKFWOVOtYwcQEg CMU i ve only ever ordered the orange chicken but it was damn good and they had it ready in less than 10 minutes for carry out this could be good or bad i don t know but it still tasted kick ass 
d9ia3CbqUbyOWQ7l0HBSaw CMU I really enjoyed the authentic Chinese food I had at lunch here The food tasted good and the service was very friendly and helpful For the uninitiated there are basically three menus here I think that maybe if they stuck to one menu they d get better ratings The best menu is their authentic Chinese menu This is on the wall to the right as you enter It is in both Chinese and in English but includes almost exclusively authentic Chinese dishes The dishes I had were off this menu were cooked by their Chinese chef and were excellent high in flavor good textures I d eat them again anytime The second menu is on the left as you come in and this is mostly Americanized Chinese foods I think these may not usually be cooked by their Chinese chef but instead by their non Chinese workers The third menu is the menu of Thai items The owner is Chinese so while I haven t actually ordered from the Thai menu I wouldn t expect great things from it The decor in the place is typical unpretentious Chinese which is to say plain and frayed at the edges Disposable plates and cups don t make much for ambiance but most inexpensive but authentic Chinese places focus on the food and not the decor I deliberated on whether to give them three or four stars but ultimately I ve going with four because I did really enjoy the food I had and the service was very good Order off the authentic right hand side of the wall insist you want it cooked authentically and I think you ll go home happy 
DA4MV1vNT9UP0AJ0Xj2JwQ CMU I worked here for a few months August until two days ago I was fired on a very contrived reason I think it was because this place doesn t get enough business Location is pretty bad for visibility even if it s convenient to campus Food is very average but I like it more than say Panda Express My parents run a restaurant so I have experience which is why I was hired in the first place this is one of the most inefficiently run restaurants ever The vegetable dishes are good though and the Chinese language menu is generally good quality if you don t mind a wait The bosses both cook when necessary but it s best to come during weekdays when the main cook is in The hot pot is also fairly popular but most of the meats are frozen Other things that are frozen include the Wheaten Foods menu potstickers wontons and meat buns I think that s pretty SOP here in CU though Portion sizes are okay They definitely shrank in the 3 months I worked there I won t analyze pricing because I m not used to eating out but I think most people consider them fair or just slightly overpriced Things to not get include the highly Americanized items on the menu especially those with breaded chicken in them The quick lunch was phased out mostly now it s a selection of two Chinese braised dishes so they keep pretty well and have an average turnover Instead they now offer Combos which are your standard rice and a main dish with an egg roll They used to give a soda with these but now only offer iced tea hot tea or a small bowl of egg drop or hot and sour soup Don t get the soups including noodle soups or appetizers unless you really like egg rolls they re decent but nothing special Certain dishes like the pork with mustard greens P10 IIRC are frozen but I think they re probably okay if you don t mind them defrosting reheating via microwave The smoothies and bubble tea are a no no they re edible and not too terrible or so I hear but go to Evo s or some other place for these the slushies are okay if you don t mind a lot of sugar Most customers seem okay with the fish but it doesn t look too great to me aka it smells and fresh fish doesn t To qualify that last statement it doesn t reek like rotten fish but you can definitely get a stronger smell than I think is usual when you gut one I bass fish at home and clean my own catch plus while it s inevitable it s frozen and quick defrosted aka in the sink in a water bath with direct contact rather than through a bag Hardly sanitary Like some other reviews have stated they really do skimp as much as possible on ingredients equipment etc Ingredients come in on Thursday nights from Far East and I m not sure when other ingredients come in However I d say to come on Friday because they probably push the old vegetables on Thursday I only worked TR lunch and Sundays so I can t say for certain A few big points about the owners behavior which they also try to instill in the workers first they will try to dissuade you from getting something that they feel is too much trouble to cook at the moment never mind if they have all the ingredients ready usually this is because it s busy secondly they do cut corners as aforementioned Another thing that most people probably aren t too concerned about because they aren t very aware of it is the matter of the special soup They only give it to regular customers but more generally to any Chinese or Chinese speaking customers If you re not Chinese speaking proficiency or a repeat customer who asks tough luck I ve seen this attitude referred to on foodie blogs as soup Nazism A last point on their behavior is that they will lie about what they have and don t have especially when it comes to drinks or if they feel they re too busy to bother with your order Normally this happens with drinks they keep changing their Combo meals and they decided to stop giving sodas with them because they didn t want to stock up they will also refuse to make you a smoothie or other blended drink if they re busy Basically they have an undersized facility an undertrained staff one of the bosses in particular gets in the way more than he keeps things going an undersized staff and basically a very mediocre business model I m kind of astounded they ve survived but if you know what to get you can get a pretty decent meal here To conclude there aren t a lot of repeat customers but they try to treat the ones they recognize well However I went to Cravings with a friend yesterday and I saw a lot of former customers that stopped coming there I d say they made a good choice Cravings has much better service food and atmosphere Other good Chinese restaurants in the area in no particular order include Mandarin and Lai Lai The Wok in Mahomet is legendary among the Chinese on campus but that s another story 
DKJKoHE3vQkHPmYE7FYdEg CMU OK here is the procedure for non Chinese folks 1 Walk up to the front desk and grab menus an order pad and a table number card 2 Sit down and pick something to eat You have 975 no joke choices of authentic Chinese Taiwanese dishes If you end up chosing sweet and sour chicken you deserve a slow fiery death 3 Write your entree number and the quantity figure on getting one entree per person and having leftovers unless you are super hungry You will get rice with the entree and return the order to the lady at the cash register who will take your money 4 That lady will give you glasses for water and direct you to where the tea is 5 Wait 10 min or so Don t fret they will bring your chopsticks and napkins 6 Enjoy the shit out of your yummy vittles Don t forget to share as no matter how freaking good your selection is whatever your fellow diner got is just as good I ve had the Salt and Pepper Shitake Mushrooms they are not on the menu but the lady at the counter knows what you are talking about and the Crispy Tofu as featured at http champaign taste blogspot com 2010 11 golden harbor authentic chinese cuisine html These two are freaking divine The tofu was the absolute best I ve ever had 
dKuyLKGJs_YGvWy-nm_FCQ CMU My preferred place to eat Chinese on campus Although I will admit that I haven t eaten at every place around town there aren t too many great Chinese restaurants around here this does not include buffets Their General Tso s chicken is amazing Giant quantities for prices a bit on the high side but not too bad considering how much you get Anything bigger than a small and you re guaranteed to take it home in a doggie bag tray thingy are the trays seriously called doggie bags too unless you re sharing it with someone else I usually only order the General Tso s or Vegetable Lo Mein my default Chinese food preferences so I can t really say much about the rest of the menu but I did order soup there once and they gave me it in a giant bowl with a decent amount of noodles It tasted okay but not great It can get kind of crowded in there with limited seating and the atmosphere isn t too great but it s acceptable 
Dlmt75tLSGEwmCymLuDGfA CMU AWESOME food and friendly wait staff The owner is so nice and always remembers me and my boyfriend when we come in and greets us personally We don t even go there that often The Chinese Eggplant in Garlic Sauce is AMAZING and the Scorpion Bowl drink is delicious and hilarious Comes in a Hawaiian themed bowl with a shot in the center that is on fire Yummy yummy 
DlrBMSFp44hdjRNDlQQLcw CMU For very cheap and not AWFULLY bad Chinese food the regular cheap two sized small and large portions menu is barely and I mean barely OK However since they ve hired a new chef they put on more pretensions now they have some alleged Szechuan dishes which are quite a bit more expensive yet EVEN WORSE than the regular dishes The new chef is worse than the traditional chefs I ve seen there for years I tried two different dishes from the more expensive menu some beef which was edible but undermediocre and then a whole Szechuan bean chili whole fish dish which was so bad and literally stinky I couldn t finish it I should mention I love Chinese food and I had lots of it in lots of places The reason I still visit the place rarely is a cheapish and tasty Crispy Whole Fish in the regular menu which is not authentic Chinese but which for some reason I crave every three months The campus Chinese place to go is Lai Lai period There s simply no comparison in quality and when the ratio price quantity quality satisfaction is being taken into account Lai Lai offers by far the best deal on campus Compared to Empire Chinese Evo where the chef comes out of the toilet and back into the kitchen without washing his hands or even Mandarin Wok which has some OK dishes but not equal to Lai Lai 
DMG4QV6fpXVAL_QpuR_UNg CMU short on time not wanting to make dinner convenience of online order delivery 6 minute chinese tonight for dinner it was not good not even okay it was really kind of gross i ordered kung pao bean curd and literally it was just bean curd and sauce no peanuts no water chesnuts no veggies nothing just bean curd oh and sauce that tastes like sort of amped up sweet and sour sauce it was beyond gross i didn t even finish it i have an idea 6 minute chinese take an extra 6 or 7 shooooot i ll even wait 10 extra minutes and make your food edible 
dNA5HJMmSgszaQ-F2MsgxQ CMU With so many Chinese food options on campus Mandarin Wok faces some stiff competition and unfortunately doesn t quite stand up to its competitors I have only eaten at Mandarin Wok a few times within the past semesters but every time has been somewhat disappointing Their soups and noodle bowls skimp on the meat and vegetables while their standard dishes are simply lackluster Portion sizes seem smaller than its competitors and for the price paid Cravings definitely has better value The menu is tremendously large and can be confusing with unfamiliar customers as well With almost an entire wall filled with an exclusive Chinese character menu it is recommended to bring along a native Chinese speaker to help decipher and select the better items While there might be fantastic dishes hidden amidst the heap of possible items Mandarin Wok for the unfamiliar customer is not a smooth stop by and eat type of place 
DRCj0b2e31vR-nAUBqoMpw CMU Service was awful Sat down was asked to order not even 60 secs later and then was dutifully ignored the rest of the time I m Asian too but apparently no love there I had the three cup chicken and on a sudden craving an order of crab ragoon The chicken came out pretty fast in a one of those sizzling bowls yum I was pretty excited because it was drowned in delicious brown basil sauce and had large bamboo shoots I totally would have enjoyed it more if it wasn t obvious that the chicken was the normal breaded chicken breast bits used in every other chicken dish Chinese fast food restaurants have Three cup chicken should be made with chicken on the bone with the meat nearly falling off because it has been simmered lovingly Apparently my expectations were too high my bad The crab ragoon came out nearly at the end of the meal which caused me much confusion because I had forgotten about it Nearly burnt to a crisp but still fried wanton skins filled mayo can t go wrong with it I ll come back and with lowered expectations I am sure I will enjoy myself more 
dTltuTjxmAwEo0zz8kYzDg CMU We went with someone who was a regular here and they pre ordered a lobster for us We had a 7 pm reservation and arrived at 7 10 pm We sat down and the lobster came out right away Yay Unfortunately it was cold and apparently was cooked earlier in anticipation of our 7 pm arrival Boo Who cooks a lobster before the guests arrive What if they don t show Then the owner blames us for being late And then we found a few pieces of pork in the lobster What The rest of the food was ok The braised duck was delicious but small portion The ma po tofu was good Stir fried bok choy hearts were good The stir fried beef was over tenderized and boring We ordered braised fish that came out steamed Again some pointless explanations and the fish was replaced with the proper braised fish Oh well a wasted night out out for dinner except for my fortune cookie You will inherit some money or a piece of land Good for me bad for someone else 
dUOMsweszu3XWIRLJlQp_g CMU I ve had the Tom Yum Koong and the pad thai chicken and shrimp Unfortunately the soup was only ok The shrimp was very overcooked I ve had pad thai there a few times and it s pretty good but not the best in this town Would like to try some other dishes 
DvC1UtSjXg-nurzk_fHC2A CMU The food is inconsistent Not the worst on campus but overpriced greasy salty nothing to compare to a place like Lai Lai The reason I won t go back there is that I happened to be in the restroom and I saw one of the chefs or the cooks not sure going out of the bathroom without washing his hands This is unforgivable I don t care how good their food could be but anyway trust me it s not as good as to be worth this lack of hygiene 
dysv0KBS_SiDZ2P7hlSwlg CMU The food was great waitstaff was nice We had the crispy tofu and teriyaki chicken We talked to the guys who bus though and they said that if you don t bus your own table and leave a tip instead the bus boys don t get to keep it It goes to the owners So bus your own table 
E-kykpZwCZur3OSaVc6f8A CMU the reason I m giving them only 3 stars is that they are rude on the phone and always seem angry I only order delivery from them other than that the food is good and they deliver fast 
e1n0q4-hV0AN4QdUMXhZ1Q CMU Despite what others say about Lai Lai Wok I actually like this place The prices are relatively cheap and the food is good The lady that works the cash register is really nice too I usually get the salt and pepper squid and fried pork chop over rice Everything is so flavorful and perfectly seasoned Did I mention it s cheap My family loves it too Always gotta stop by and get some takeout before I head home Make sure you stop by 
e8csEZTBHSwUXOi2gpW0pw CMU fast you can get your food in under 5 mins cheap about 5 big portion sometimes you can get 2 meals really nice owner he works as hard or even harder than any worker there and is very nice to talk to Sometimes he even offer you free eggroll Now im not a big fan of eggroll but it is free food is ok you will get tired of it if you eat there everyday which I did for almost the whole month when I was preparing for my Qual exam but give yourselves a break and things will be back to normal again 
e9r3_8VXrzznPRTv8ZNORg CMU Food poisoning worst taste of tea worst service Stay away from it for your life We a group of 4 entering Evo for some bubble tea We ordered coconut taro and boba The taste of them were terrible and we could even find the powder they used to make those tea Coconut tasted like some out dated milk and taro tasted like sugared water The servers were unhappy seeing us just order drinks not food and they paid us the worst service ever with so negative attitude The worst part is when we got home and prepared for dinner two of us got food poisoning They spent the whole night to calm the pain in their stomach and vomit nothing because they had no chance to eat anything else but those Evo tea Please let other people read this comment for the good of their lives 
EAsNPHnHzyk3s4DwfGMSbw CMU Food is really good The ordering process is a bit complicated at first but you get used to it You don t have to pay for tip which is a big plus for a college student Portions are fair and the food is excellent quality The fried tofu is really good 
EbR3MUG4eAYDRWTithCSAw CMU Golden Wok is by far the best place to go for noodles in town So far I ve had their Pad Thai Pad Kee Mow Pad Prig Pow not sure on this name and Ho Fun and they were better than anything you can find in Champaign Urbana That s not saying a whole lot but their Ho Fun is one of my favorite things to get when I eat out Their curries are also pretty phenomenal the meat quality isn t too great you can tell that they buy their meat except maybe for the duck from the big commercial vendors but the curry itself is exceptional If you do decide to go with the curry I d recommend the Panang as it s not loaded with vegetables as the other variations tend to be The Thai iced tea is also quite good Thai iced tea is one of those things that s almost guaranteed to be good anywhere you get it but as Christina F puts it it s well worth the 2 10 if you want a nice sweet closer on your meal Their lunch specials however are a little less desirable as it s pretty much the same as every other Chinese lunch special in town with the staple Beef with Broccoli Shrimp in Lobster Sauce Sweet and Sour Chicken and the like and it s honestly not very good I ve personally tried two or three chicken dishes for the lunch special decidedly giving the Wok another chance for redemption after each subsequently disappointing meal but they failed to deliver each dish being pretty much the same as the last but in a different sauce I also have to agree with the 2 star review that s also up here The Tom Yum Khai wasn t very good when I had it I ordered the Shrimp Tom Yum Khai and it tasted overpoweringly like shrimp and mushrooms you could barely taste the broth under the taste of these two ingredients Overall though I m willing to give Wok 4 stars because if you know what to order you re almost guaranteed to get a good and tasty meal 
eCdNm6d7NnMT2WdrAQ6HYg CMU I came here again and requested General Tso s Tofu something not on their eat in menu IT WAS AWESOME I will never go to another Chinese food restaurant 
EcMZ0bJntBkBreboYHlcmg CMU A little bit of home away from home A wide selection healthy portions cheap prices and consistently yummy Chinese food is why I really like it here Cravings reminds me of my mom s cooking which is always a great treat when I m feeling homesick or just get ridiculously sick of dorm food which is often They have a very extensive menu with something for everyone they have lunch specials for even cheaper chow and the owner is very friendly yay for discounts especially if you go often I would recommend any of their noodle or rice dishes I frequently go with Ma Po Tofu or anything with chicken and they cater all people from those on special diets vegetarians Americanized Chinese food think orange chicken to the more traditional dishes You can take out as with most Chinese restaurants but I ve always sat down with friends when I eat here Good eats 
ED0u36Qrx8I_pBRMKLulhg CMU Overrated clap clap clap clap Overrated Yelpers I usually trust your judgment but you didn t get this one right Since I love small hole in the wall places with friendly owners this place meets those criteria this review is kind of hard to write but I have to do it The Mongolian beef that I ordered was cold Additionally it wasn t sweet and there were a lot of onions in the dish A lot The ingredients rice beef and onions were fine but I can t eat something that has been sitting around for awhile and isn t fresh and hot I ll try this place again because the owner is a nice guy but my first experience wasn t a good one 
EdbT-G3t1d3j_2dlC8wQeQ CMU Debbie the manager of Peking Garden is always so incredibly courteous and kind to the customers She remembers all of their names and greets and hugs their kids too I go there all the time and it s such a nice refreshing change from many other restaurants with bad and distant service Not only does Peking Garden have great service but their food is so unbelievably tasty Try their crunchy wontons or egg rolls for appetizers they are always such a hot treat You can also ask them to make a dish with special considerations like make it non sweet and they never give you trouble for specific requests unlike other restaurants in town Overall it s a really nice atmosphere with private booths relaxing eastern music in the background and smiles for miles 
Eds0jSU7G0Ap178QOlhL-Q CMU Food was okay The smoked tofu with celery and pork shreds was okay but underseasoned The spicy boiled beef was also just okay Not terrible we ate the whole thing but nothing to write home about either Not thrilled with the obvious clumping from excess corn starch either They do have lots of space and can be good for groups and their milk tea with boba was good I d go again but it s not worth going out of your way for by any means 
EEgLPYmpLQTa74IzC4SOJA CMU Between here and Lai Lai Champaign has some very good Chinese choices on campus Not to say that the other local choices aren t good as well but these two restaurants serve some of the more classy authentic Chinese dishes that you wouldn t expect other restaurants to serve Fortunately for the students these restaurants cook well enough that there is no immediate need to run to Chinatown to enjoy good Chinese cooking Don t miss the tea smoked chicken here Although it s not as friendly to non Chinese and usually very busy don t let that deter you from visiting this gem 
eeuvfcpOQG5uqwwVza6igg CMU I can overlook a slow delivery order that mixed up crab rangoon with egg rolls but the final straw was getting bubble less bubble tea We ordered it and it came out as basically a sugar slurry I asked the people working there where the bubbles were and they said they didn t have any Would have been nice to know before I ordered 
egXcFzG50t0I60e04tbhgQ CMU I used to live above Empire so I became very well acquainted with their food Their food is amazing best Chinese food I ve had hands down The shrimp in their Shrimp and Broccoli dish was my favorite most Asian restaurants give you very small low quality shrimps but Empire s are big jumbo shrimps and are good quality After graduating from U of I and leaving the area I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant like it 
EGzywHgVxSQh5VgeuXZkwA CMU I love love love Golden Harbor So delicious and definitely AUTHENTIC Chinese and Taiwanese food It is not unusual for there to be a wait so call in advance if you are traveling with a large party The menu might be a bit hard to navigate so if you have someone in your group who can read speak Chinese that will help make the experience much easier Regardless the management is really nice and they have been always happy to help customers with the menu or make suggestions The crispy tofu ah so good and the soft shell crab in garlic sauce yum and the lion s head not actual lion heads but three giant meatballs so juicy and flavorful actually everything that I have had there has been absolutely delicious and I am convinced it is the best Chinese restaurant in the area Go with a large group of friends so you can order a bunch of dishes and share family style When my family visited campus for graduation they definitely approved What is especially refreshing is that in spite of the boast worthy food neither the food nor the service is pretentious in the least bit Golden Harbor thanks for the delicious food good service and great times 
EiAKca5n3Vs0Cp3RN4eArg CMU I go at least 1 every 2 weeks I LOVE THIS PLACE I am addicted to there Jakarta Fried Rice I always look for it when I go to other places but they don t have it If they do have it they don t come close to Cravings version Their menu is really big Everything that I have tried I liked I like that people speak Chinese it gives it an authentic feel 
Eq3RI5hbviopgD5doEHT1A CMU I ve been living off Cravings these past 2 years literally They have a big menu so the tip is you know what to order Don t just try something randomly as you might have a negative experience The owner is very nice and every time I ran into him in Champaign he always remembered me and said hi to me Dishes that I recommend include hot spicy chicken my go to dish I had this like everyday last spring mapo tofu really good spicy and only 6 50 for a very generous portion gado gado chicken nutty and sweet masala fish crispy and spicy fish fillet beef pan fried chow fun stir fried beef with large noodle really good Sizzling chicken pot I have to stress it it s SIZZLING chicken cooked with basil and onion Pepper and Salt Squid apparently everything starts with Pepper and Salt ___ is really good Try pepper and salt fish also Some more Chinese dishes that I like black mush room tofu w groundpork basil pork with rice bean noodles with ground pork a lot of people asked me what I had when I ordered this dish hot sour seafood noodle soup tom yum based with LOTS of seafood perfectly for a cold day these 4 dishes above can be found on the white board near the counter The Mongolian beef is good but it s not consistent I like it to be a bit overcooked but sometimes it s still a little rare to my liking especially during peak hours These dishes are all from the Chinese menu since i m not a big fan of Americanized dishes in general 
EQxlBdVxjq8v4sxYLw35Lw CMU Food 4 Price 4 Atmosphere 3 Service 3 
eSZmKYyNUdJEzM3e7E5d0Q CMU Tried the salt and pepper shrimp and another shrimp dish Awesome 
EUPzM2wJPFWmOlNvHcgVeQ CMU Every time I came to visit one of my best friends while he was in school here we d make a trip or two out to ECR for their amazing General Tso s Tofu No other Chinese place I ve ever been to has made this dish as great as ECR The portion is always huge and I bring home leftovers It s also inexpensive well lit and the people who work here are incredibly sweet They also offer free hot tea and water during your meal We always found a place to sit whether it was just the two of us or with a larger group of people I really wish I had this place nearby I miss it Yummmmm 
evway_Esgf7LTewxHha4mg CMU 2 things to order Jakarta fried rice and hot and spicy chicken 
EWSvwvA5wZVDyV-ePCG88g CMU I ve only been here during lunch hours when it s almost completely empty for their dim sum The dim sum isn t bad for somewhere not in Chicago but it s obvious that most of everything is frozen and re steamed Prices aren t bad either about the usual prices for dim sum They might be the only place on campus that makes real fruit slushies with boba Evo uses syrup yuck Other than that the regular food is nothing special and rumor has it this place is closing soon since no one ever goes there anymore But that s just a testament to the ownership and the so so food If you want dim sum you can always go to Saigon 
EZMJWN3Qq9w-wQVMaXUhaA CMU I think this is my favorite Chinese Taiwanese eatery in Campustown I first thought it was a slower but higher quality and price restaurant but I was wrong in a good way First the food quality is indeed good I chose the Mongolian beef with broccoli and the chicken with snow peas The sauce was good not too thick or not too soupy and the broccoli was crisp and not too cooked The chicken with snow peas was really a pleasant treat as well The veggies rivaled the taste of the chicken always a good sign The food came out surprisingly quick and the price was almost as low as the lesser quality places nearby I regret I did not take advantage of Lai Lai Wok more often while I was in grad school The food was better but it is kind of far away from campus as well but I think the food is worth it for sure 
FBRcx_4vvt7_Rsy5tFMoww CMU I must preface this review by saying that for about 364 days per year I have no desire to eat Chinese food For about 90 of those 364 days I would say I actively dislike Chinese For one magical day however I must get my Chinese fix Today was that day A friend recommended Golden Harbor as the place to go and thus we went Honestly it s not your traditional Chinese restaurant In fact I would call it a cafeteria where they bring your food to you You don t really see a server except when the food comes You clear your own table or you pay them to do it It s kind of absurd how it s all organized At the same time it s Chinese food I would eat more than once a year I actually liked it and since Golden Harbor didn t really score any points for ambiance or any of that cute stuff it s four stars on the basis of food alone In addition when the rice cooker crapped out the manager apologized for the inconvenience and hooked us up with lo mein instead It s a little more expensive and a little more complicated to order but I would say the food is more than worth it 
FDel1uyQ42pppJKsFTezVQ CMU Best Chinese Restaurant around the Champaign Urbana area As a Chinese I am picky about the taste of dishes and Golden Harbor just can satisfy our tongues and stomachs If they can have better decorations it would be even greater Recommendations Taiwan Guai Bao Fuzhu Niunan Bao XO Baby Squids etc The fishes are also good Pity that I cannot type the Chinese names for these dishes that would be of great help for Chinese gourmets like me 
FNltaz8Uh7GRYWzbkeN0GQ CMU Ate here a while ago and didn t really like the food Read the bad reviews Knew it was not going to be that great Decided to go again because I wanted to try something different Got this Chinese fish dish that was just absolutely horrible Fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste I could make something better at home Avoid at all cost Why go here when there are much better restaurants around On another note apparently they have hotpots there now Maybe I ll stop by there again just for the hot pot even though I ll probably end up regretting it again 
fS27Kz69lj4b9DbH2CCp6w CMU The bubble tea here is simply amazing I am from California where they have tons of bubble tea places However Evo Cafe supplies the most amazing bubble tea I have ever ingested They have a wide variety of bubble tea ranging from milk tea to slushies They also have boba and many different types of jellies to go with your drink This place has become one of my favorites to get my milk tea fix 
FT7Vw--9DZCJl1F8vsmpqQ CMU everyone is blinded by the tofu for a place that is considered the best chinese food place is uiuc area I wondered would it be possible to have crummy dishes When I went my first and only time to this place I ordered meatless udon pan fried noodles w mushrooms and Satay tofu When I ordered I assumed what could go wrong everyone has had good things to say about this shack so anything everything should be good Well let me tell you I was Wrong The pan fried noodles were at most sauteed but definitely not pan fried for they were slimy and were practically tasteless besides the stinky mushrooms that shaped the horrid taste and to think i thought i loved mushrooms The satay tofu was bland and mainly tasted like an orifice or a dirty mouth it had such a weird nasty taste to it The only way I could barely eat half of what I ordered was by drowning it in Eel Sauce I had in my refrigerator Maybe this is my fault from ordering from the translated menu Maybe it s my fault for being an American All i know is that if that is what authentic chinese food tastes like thheeen WT eff THEN I will gladly stick with the American aspect of chinese food because I totally wasted 20 on a bulk load of crap It was really bad possibly some of the worst food I ever had in my life and it s not like I ordered pig tongue I ordered totally basic items All i know is that it s pretty sad when the only good thing i had in my order was the steamed white rice After this experience I really hope I just managed to order the two crappiest dishes from this place if not that was a sad excuse for food and I was a sure sucker for paying 20 for it 
FUa-qt0L-k-3XrjD5n7FWA CMU we can no longer call this place HOG since they added the Thai Delivery is nice Tofu Pad Thai not so nice Lacking a few of the standard components Also super hot like it cleared out my sinuses hot Next time i ll stick to some standard Chinese fare 
fUGqw-zcMT4moHoLGr-rcg CMU Saturday night this place is hopping It is a seat yourself restaurant cafeteria feeling that has tables for 2 10 tops it seems You grab a menu or look at the wall of dishes in Mandarin write down what you want to eat by number on a server pad and take it up to order pay There is a 50 cent charge per person for cleanup fee but no tip is necessary They give you a number and eventually bring the food out to your table There is self serve tea in the corner There are a lot of options for food We had 7 people ordered 7 dishes Sigua On Choy lamb dish beef on choy crispy tofu fish filet spicy beef bamboo Everything came out hot and flavorful Less salt would have made everything even better but overall chaotic happy atmosphere Prices are more than other chinese restaurants 10 15 per plate Looking forward to trying other dishes in the future 
FUiGagY6c1KgymFwQv7GOA CMU I used to eat here very often when I was study at UIUC couple years back However last year I happened to visit Champaign again and want to have some of my favorite food at Mandarin wok so I stopped by here to have lunch In my opinion the quality as well as the taste is sooo much better when it belongs to the original owner I was disappointed with crispy tofu that is not as good as before I also ordered different kind of foods but nothing can compare to the one usually I had before If you really want to try a real mandarin wok you should go to Mahomet where the original owner open a new restaurant name the wok 
fxeP38MAxbo8MN9G33-URg CMU Bad Just plain bad It s hard to believe that Chinese people make this food It has so little resemblance to Chinese food Number 1 Starting from last place I can t remember what I had It s better that I didn t because whatever I ordered has nothing to do with what I was given 
FYfYYOXV1Yr9qXKGLT4p3w CMU I like the tea smoked duck here quite a lot 
fzKLCaCy65uXmQxXbbHzHQ CMU I used to like the foods in this restaurant Unfortunately they put too much sugar in all of their food latterly I would not visit the restaurant unless they change this practice 
G4dh6Q1PKsXt6cQRkRyctw CMU This place is amazing If you don t know what to order ask the woman at the counter she is super friendly and helpful Forget all the lower reviews that complaining about busing your own table getting your own silverware drinks etc The food is amazing and authentic Don t order off the American Chinese menu Pick a meat vegetable and a description that sounds good If you want to know the difference ask Come early or late for a better chance of a table Some of our favorites include Steam Pork Buns Crispy Tofu not good leftover Spicy Eggplant Salt and Pepper Anything though ask for light on salt BBQ Duck or Spicy Duck and their soups one was a spicy pork with wide noodles really good and huge 
G57WcV_y_KbSA1lo2foo3Q CMU Absolutely delicious food Actually authentic Chinese food I love their steamed Chinese broccoli My favorite dish is their Crispy Tofu with green onion in a sweet chilli sauce Note about venue Golden Harbor is not the right place to go if you re wanting a classy and quiet atmosphere for a dinner date business lunch ect The dining section is dirty the furniture is cheap the lighting is not flattering and it gets pretty loud during rush hours 
G7ZAKi5NFAELttl32fGiQQ CMU If you are looking for great Pad Thai Golden Wok is the place to be It is great Also if you are looking for a cheap lunch they have some of the best lunch specials during the week You get fried rice an entree and an egg roll for 6 Not too bad at all Definitely a great restaurant that I frequent regularly 
G8mk4kt14q_o8COywPZ_XQ CMU Was a big fan of Rainbow Garden on Neil Street although I haven t been there in some time Decided to try the Urbana location which is closer to me The ambiance was clean quiet and open Service was prompt and friendly The menu was extensive I don t know what constitutes authentic Chinese food but this is certainly delicious The Scallion Pancake was different than what I remember at Neil Street but still very good The chicken dish I had was excellent and ample Enough to share Will definitely be back again and again to try other dishes One thing I always wonder about is the tea Chinese restaurant tea is like movie popcorn delicious but defies reproducing at home Also my waiter was a magician I had left half my entree and most of my fried rice and asked for a box He returned with my food in the typical Chinese take out white box but such a tiny one Is that everything Yes Disbelief on my part but when I dumped it later onto a plate at home sure enough everything was there Magic 
g9-sB82qbiSFkhlGQCEHDg CMU I will admit that I am not the most adventurous eater I am especially wary of Chinese restaurants Good Chinese food is awesome bad Chinese food is one of the nastiest things on earth So I rarely go to a new Chinese place without someone telling me that it s worth trying A couple of my husband s co workers who were very in the know about Chinese food told him that Cravings was one of the best in town We tried it and it became one of our mainstays We usually order the crispy beef which is lightly breaded and fried I think and then tossed in this incredible sweet spicy sauce One order is enough for both of us and unlike other places that do not use the best part of the cow when they are breading and frying it and tossing it in a delicious sauce the beef is usually really good not tough and stringy and fatty and gross The man who owns Cravings is very nice and I m always happy to see crowds eating there They seem to have authentic dishes along with the Americanized stuff so if you want a steamed whole fish you can get one here I would try other things but I am too addicted to the crispy beef to move on 
gehIJPYquhQqDQG4NG3AeQ CMU It is the only restaurant in the Champaign area that serves authentic northern Chinese food If you are from northern China you can t miss it 
GEIlkzi1H6WLbcB-G5aSEA CMU Alright food Pretty average in taste quality and prices A bit inconsistent with their cooking 
giAfmn_RXxvi83mibWUAoA CMU This place has the best orange chicken I have ever tasted My only regret is that I discovered it so late in my undergrad The food is made in a respectable amount of time and the owner is so friendly Call ahead because this place is always packed around dinner time The free hot tea is fantastic I like everything about this place and can t wait for the next time I am able to go Five stars are well deserved 
GIFgIwNZfWa4b-KtIwOoiQ CMU The other yelpers are right Golden Wok has THE best pad thai around and it s not even a thai restaurant it s chinese thai a combination I usually stay far far away from Correction Golden Wok has the best pad thai EVER And yes this is comparing it against not only the local places but also every thai restaurant I ve ever been to and I ve been to plenty The reason why their pad thai is so good is because of the flavoring A lot of other Thai places either don t have enough of it or they have so much that it s overly sweet and or salty and it becomes so cloying I can t ever bear to finish it Golden Wok s pad thai on the other hand is done so well I finished it very quickly in one sitting and as others have said their portions are VERY generous Besides the flavor the noodles are also done well not mushy and stuck together and not undercooked and overall the dish isn t too oily either Four stars for the delicious pad thai all on its own I haven t tried anything else there but we ll see how that goes like I said I usually stay away from chinese thai places but I feel like Golden Wok has earned my respect if nothing else for their pad thai They have their own lot so parking isn t as bad as it is on campus Look out for the small yellowish standalone building it s easy to drive past it 
gjQUGzl70sRnrRSXlmSOHw CMU Best Chinese in C U And I m Chinese Fried Rice Combo General Tso s and Egg Rolls on the reg Went here after graduation no line Ate like Kings at our lazy susy BOOM 
GN1kM-Xsd2LagMelRwROiA CMU Surprisingly good Chinese food in the middle of Champaign Yes it is mostly Americanized but it s not too greasy and not too crazy with the sauces such that it doesn t overwhelm but instead massages the palate with simple flavors and limited numbers of different textures The dish I recall the best was the ma pa tofu and hot and sour soups Simple convenient and not too difficult to eat The noodles were a bit disappointing lo mein came out a bit hm drier than I thought it would be almost like the noodles didn t cook properly 
gNzAqTTah1NgEG55r5GhUA CMU Great Green tea I loved the flavors Didn t like that most of the menu was in Chinese Felt like the only non Asian people to visit But the egg roll was great and so was the empress chicken The Lo Mein was great I will be back despite the fact that I don t read or speak Chinese 
gpA1166bCpWeXWgciSKDeQ CMU The bubble tea is pretty good I d often stop here after class and grab one to bring back home Food wise they re average for what else you ll find around in Champaign Urbana That being said unfortunately the service here leans toward poor fair if you re white There I said it I m not taking it back I ve been here multiple times with my buddies and we were ignored or hardly waited on That would be understandable if we were loud or obnoxious but we were 4 quiet white guys One time we went in were seated and nobody came to take our order I went up to the counter after about 15 min to ask if we could order In broken English I was told that someone would be there to take our order After another 5 10 minutes of waiting we decided to just up and leave Awesome 
GrjZu13oq1yYBsyFKROzMg CMU Love this place Go back all the time It s theory Chinese place I go to 
GvsQ4YtOuHlzFBWZzyvRgQ CMU the gado gado sauce was great but the chicken was overly fried the sauce in the mixed veggies was just way too thick way too salty and probably loaded with msg 
GW5Mm4qO_9CPzbUky0WjJQ CMU Good spot better than most Chinese places I ve been This review may be biased only because I m not the biggest fan of Chinese food But I do know a good place versus a bad place this was good The food is made cleanly and quality is good its a clean spot too I m from Chicago and some Chinese places are not so good at keeping the place clean We had some fried tofu which was awesome some breaded fish walnut shrimp and another tofu dish with beef which was good I love walnut shrimp but the sauce on it was overkill and just drowning in it that day I d still come back to try other things In short nice spot better than most Chinese joints 
GXP6RPioszKoZ0JAfcef6A CMU Another proof of what people who live here will put up with I walked in the door for dinner on a wintry evening and due to a serious ventilation problem found myself enveloped by invisible choking fumes The fumes were from cooking peppers I m guessing They didn t smell so much as they burned and choked Some sort of fan in the kitchen must have been broken seriously it was comical I am not reporting an individual sensitivity of mine A very large party arrived just after we did and so I got to watch about fifteen people walk in the front door and then sequentially have the same reaction walk in from the cold take a deep breath and start coughing We all went along I m not sure why The restaurant was about one third full and all of the patrons sat there tears in our eyes each eating a few bites and then experiencing a racking cough We went through the bizarre ordering process and obeyed the greasy cardboard hand lettered signs So many of the other reviews rave about the food but mine was extremely oversalted Oversalted after all this Even if it had been Michelin three star food you ve got to have air My advice Focus on the basics 
G_W_kc2uPE8ler957r2ncw CMU Cravings definitely has the best Chinese food I ve had in the area and probably ever I highly recommend the Sweet and Sour Chicken an American favorite it s perfectly crispy and delicious Also great are the noodle soups and the red curry The guy who runs the place is awesome and even though it s usually packed I ve never not found a place to sit down I wish I could give Cravings 5 stars but I can t Their menu is too big and as a result you can find some serious misses if you order incorrectly I ve had some of the best Asian food at Cravings but also some of the worst They should record everything everyone orders for a couple months and only keep the top 20 of all items sold which would result in a menu that s still too big If you haven t been go with someone someone who you trust who can help you to order correctly and you won t be disappointed 
H2bQs8FMinCVvwStBXtOgQ CMU This place is amazing They have a chinese menu on the wall and an english version book menu I mean BOOK its so extensive i didn t think there was anyway that much food could be in one place lol I cant remember what i ordered but it was really good chicken with chiles maybe There doesn t seem to be anything sweet on the menu Its pricey but a total experience worth having I thought i was back in China town in NYC Loved it you gotta go but be prepared to spend 30 mins looking at the menu before you get in line to order your food Get your own beverage passed the cashier and find a seat They have Extra large tables like in real chinese restaurants with a lazy susan in the middle to share Sharing is the cornerstone of chinese eating love that 
H6VJWk0F9WXRcD8fEWi_ag CMU This is really a great addition to the Champaign Urbana area While the cooking is not as great as Lai Lai or Golden Harbor the dishes here are still prepared well with fresh ingredients The best thing about the restaurant is that it is really the nicest Chinese restaurant around with Tang Dynasty also being comparable The first thing that will stand out to anyone is the decor It is comfortable traditional and hip at the same time Next the silverware is for fine dining and everything from the plates to the cups and teapot all bear the restaurant name This is pretty unique for Chinese restaurants and gives the restaurant a bit of an upscale feeling The service is also pretty good and we were able to order in English Mandarin and Cantonese all in the same meal As for the food they cooked common dishes like General Chicken and Sole Fillet with Chinese Greens well Since a lot of restaurants around Champaign are in Mandarin or Szechuan style it was nice to enjoy some dishes prepared Cantonese style The noodles soups were light and enjoyable as well The rice was a bit fluffier and most than most other local restaurants suggesting that it wasn t prepared in enormous quantities The prices were pretty good so I m sure I ll return again soon 
h7Y0erIhNR2mp3xq8gZNBg CMU This place has everything you could want from a Chinese take out Cheap delicious and fast The combination plates are excellent for the price getting you a choice from a dozen or so entrees fried rice and an egg roll for about 8 It s so much food that I normally get two meals out of it which is a hell of a deal Try it 
haj1PD8t5FRx4cE2De-5wg CMU The food here isn t great but it isn t bad either It s cheap but Champaign has lots of great Chinese options such as Lai Lai Wok or Golden Harbor nearby Among the cheaper options though this is about par 
hCPUN6eZsc7tWK8NgSaHdA CMU While the smoothies are good especially the banana their food and service is less than desirable I have tried to like this place and give it multiple chances yet every time I left wishing I went somewhere else Every time no joke they have messed up my order Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else Sorry 
hCuiDGOtUPIlbxhdA2wFjA CMU Now that s what I call mediocre I m not a snob when it comes to Chinese food at all I ve experienced both unnecessarily authentic Chinese cuisine and hyper Americanized Chinese food and I will go for something in between every time So this place seems like it will fit right in with that but it doesn t The service blows they have a 7 minimum charge for credit debit cards when I told them that was not allowed withiin their contracts with the credit card companies they gave me a blank stare I walked out The couple of times I have eaten here I was not even mildly enthused about anything the fried rice has no soy sauce flavor or any particular flavor at all it reminds me of those microwaveable rice cups The meat was chewy and decently flavored but the portion was pretty small not worth the price Don t worry there s about 15 000 Asian restaurants on Green St I m sure that you ll find something 
hcWGHPsWB2Q9Jsp2oXMA5w CMU A business traveler s perspective The prices are alright but the food was really really greasy I got spring rolls that were dripping and crab rangoon that were somehow greasy and dry cardboardy at the same time No homemade sweet and sour sauce The wonton soup was decent a little light on flavor and the wontons fell apart instantly I also got mixed sauteed vegetables they were cooked nicely and you get a load of rice but the sauce is pretty heavy and salty Since I have to eat out when I travel obviously I ordered the sauteed vegtables thinking I could get something healthy to save for lunch when I wouldn t have time to go out for lunch the next day Nope Not great for eat in if you travel and have to eat out a lot since I have to go to a restaurant all the time I want to sit somewhere nice if I am going to stay in the place while I eat As a note I got takeout but that is a tip I always wish I had ahead of time regardless 
HET7ZeqcxZ6k87VIkpUOPQ CMU I have been to Golden Harbor a few times and done take out a few times This place is great I haven t had even a 1 4 of the dishes they offer but so far the ones that I have had have been excellent Yes the Crispy Tofu is amazing The crispy orange chicken and the orange beef were very tasty I really enjoyed the Taiwanese Salt n Pepper Crispy Chicken We had one of the Hot Pots but I don t remember which but I wish I did because it was really good I also tried the Crispy Cuttlefish with salt yolk which I was very surprised by how good it was I though it would be too salty but it was quite tasty The service is always pleasant and now that they have their system down the wait time is very reasonable Each dish is large so it is best to go with a lot of people and that way you can share many dishes Looking forward to the next time I get to go 
HF5KAw0voKinGRshnGIt1g CMU I ve ordered delivery from this place in the past However I enjoyed my first dining experience couple days ago I am surprised to enter a clean and quiet place Rainbow Garden had a nice oriental ambiance I m not referring to the tacky and excess Asian imageries on many walls of Asian restaurants in general The interior space had a beautiful red wall with red black elements and simple oriental decor complementing the space You don t see many places like that at Asian restaurants Enough with the wall color and such The lunch special was a very reasonable price ranging between 5 6 It consist of the type of meat veg your choice of fried or white rice 1 egg roll and your choice of sweet sour soup or egg drop soup The lunch portion is very nice and I think 5 6 for lunch is very reasonable However their regular entrees after lunch might be a little pricey for a hungry poor college kid My boyfriend and I have grown to have bigger appetite over the month We shared a Mongolian lunch special with two jja jang myuns black bean noodle with shrimp meat and assorted veggies which was a little too much The jja jang myun was very tasty and I would recommend people to try it and they serve you pickled yellow raddish on the side More importantly I would highly recommend people to stop ordering delivery for once get off their lazy butts get out and experience their dining service for once Don t get me wrong their delivery service is fast and good also 
hHgzqDr6-d7UFooFMo-Y3g CMU I went with a bunch of our friends to celebrate my friends birthday party Good Chinese food I loved the taste service is pretty fast and this place is must for group party 
hHviklJF4rYNLSjHIG8Y0Q CMU As many other reviewers have already mentioned this restaurant is operated by the same owners who manage the Rainbow Garden on Neil Street While the Neil Street location was fairly classy on the inside this new venue is even more elegant and refined The servers wear starched white dress shirts and the furniture is made of heavy dark wood I would definitely recommend it for serious business lunches during the day and romantic dates in the evening There is also a bar area that is probably supposed to serve as a cocktail lounge with a TV but I m having a hard time imagining people coming to this place just for drinks If you re looking for something fairly exotic or authentic this would likely not be your place No baby squid or duck tongue on the menu Instead you ll find the standard Americanized fare sweet and sour chicken beef and broccoli fried rice and egg rolls To compare the food to your average greasy take out place is not a fair characterization however All of the dishes are cooked with what tastes like better quality ingredients Vegetables are cut and prepared artfully The sauces are a bit more nuanced in their flavor The skill in preparation and presentation is also reflected in their prices as you can expect to pay around 8 for most dishes the upper range is around 15 for seafood For vegetarians I would recommend the eggplant in garlic sauce The sauce is slightly spicy slightly sweet and delicious by itself with some steamed rice The chicken and green beans is simple and tasty the vegetables still slightly crisp It s also covered in garlic yum All of the pork dishes are made with Chinese barbecue pork which is a combination of sweet and smoky and usually somewhat chewy Like the old location the new Rainbow Garden offers lunch specials that are served until 2 30 I still argue that this is the best lunch special in town with each meal costing around 6 to 8 The specials come with rice soup and an egg roll As with dinner the quality of the food is above average compared to takeout places No slimy sauces and wilted vegetables To summarize this restaurant is for people who love Chinese food for its salty sweet and sticky sauces but also want to eat this food in a more refined setting 
hk3UKThuY6knHH2zlBg8xg CMU Just bad I ve been their twice now and both times I regretted it The second time I went there I ordered some chinese vegetables we intended to get bok choy but we said the names of a few other chinese vegetables and they ended up giving us one of those The chicken dish I got was just bad extremely oily and americanized and not what we wanted at all The veggies were good and like what you can get at any real chinese place and maybe if you order all of your dishes in chinese you can actually get something more legit but the stuff they are going to serve to normal everyday non chinese speakers is bad 
hNSOWb4SOt0wAosVdAG9Fg CMU I have been going to this place for years I swear they have gotten even better recently I got Chicken Eggplant last time I went and it was amazing Service was very fast even though we ate there on a Saturday evening when they were very busy Food took no time to get to us Can t wait to go back 
hNYcPk_TKJaOQEwY8CjE5A CMU My favorite Chinese place in town Every single time I go back to Champaign I HAVE to eat here I remember the other restaurants that used to be in this location Fazoli s Happy Wanderer that Hawaiian place but Lai Lai looks like it s here to stay The food is superb and it comes out pretty fast Decently priced too I love the Gan Chao Niu He dry fried beef chow fun because it s never too oily but it s still super tasty They also have Oh Ah Jian though it s not on the English menu which is the Taiwanese oyster pancake that you can buy on the street in Taiwan The owner is pretty good at treating regular customers well those who aren t students that is with appetizers on the house Chances are also pretty good you ll run into an ECE professor or two during dinnertime at Lai Lai In short Lai Lai is definitely my FAVORITE restaurant near the U of I campus and maybe in all of the C U area as well 
hs18wPXAsgP5QPCUDt29Eg CMU Very good Taiwan style Chinese restaurant Taiwanese I have met tell me they barely get better at home Do I really need to continue writing 
Ht9LV0j4hse-CmteMKHDiA CMU Empire is cheap super fast and generally satisfying There are certain days where I start fantasizing about their pork dumplings and must have them And they re affordable enough that I don t feel like I should hate myself afterwards Dishes may be slightly greasy but they re tasty as hell Delivery is also pretty nice although I ve had trouble on occasion getting my order through clearly via the telephone 
HXxQn34En19j_7Rd_runFQ CMU Between here and Golden Harbor Champaign has some very good Chinese choices on campus Not to say that the other local choices aren t good as well but these two restaurants serve some of the more classy authentic Chinese dishes that you wouldn t expect other restaurants to serve Fortunately for the students these restaurants cook well enough that there is no immediate need to run to Chinatown to enjoy good Chinese cooking The Hong Sue items and Spicy Beef Tendon noodle soup are great here 
I5mCzd0TunuMSOpqWTzO1Q CMU Oh how I miss CRAVINGS This place is really like home away from home The guy who runs the place is from my hometown in Malaysia So usually when I walk in here I just ask him whats good today and I just take what he recommends For fans of uber spicy dishes try the chilli chicken Yes the place is dingy but its really cheap especially if you split family style You can call ahead to order 
I6LF8PiWdkiKiw8RW6obHQ CMU Planned on a family lunch at The Red Herring but it was unfortunately closed due to some sort of emergency Went to the Illini Union instead since we did not have much time to eat From the poor restaurant selection in the Union three of us chose Rice Garden and ordered the lunch special one entree rice an egg roll and a soda However when we ordered we were told that the only rice we could have was the white rice not the fried rice and that although teriyaki chicken was there it was not included in the lunch special Two of us had kung pao chicken the other orange sesame chicken Portions of the entree were small The food regrettably was bland My wife said nothing about her sesame chicken and the kung pao I had was flavorless and had none of the heat usually associated with the dish Bland food small portions and menu items excluded from the lunch special Never again If we had had a little more time we would have ventured into any one of several restaurants on Green Street which would have unquestionably provided us a better lunch 
IA66TEdwcw1h5lWNIXNMxQ CMU Lousy service I tried to order food online and then waited for an hour but nothing was delivered I called the restaurant to see what was up and they said the order had come in with no phone number and no address so they never put it through even though I DID enter that information online and they sent me an order confirmation to my e mail address I assume they had my e mail address but still no one let me know The woman who answered the phone was rather rude and abrupt and when asked for a manager s phone number she gave me one that didn t work I called the other location to speak to them and they said it wasn t their problem It IS their problem when their online ordering system doesn t seem to work and they make customers angry No one ever apologized or anything 
Iak7J8379mX4L7OdS5u8ww CMU For me no trip to my alma matre is complete without a visit to Empire I doubt I can be completely objective I love the place too much I mean I ve watched the family s kids grow up I recommend the General Tso s chicken The flavor of the sauce is amazing and the consistency of the chicken excellent Sit by the window and watch the campus walk by below great location 
iONqGemhk8TloX0tb9uluQ CMU BAD food is bad drink is acceptable go there only because they open til midnight 
iOstQvyRgW0PIPR1yGAqBw CMU Ugh My fiance s grandma loves this place so we took her out for dinner one night It was freezing in there she s 92 years old we asked to be seated somewhere warm and they put us right under the AC vent The food is mediocre at best and very greasy The prices however can t be beat Its incredibly cheap so if you re a college student this is the place to go literally get it to go because the atmosphere is terrible and the waitstaff are extremely apathetic 
IPBxD2k8F0tP4S4Dd7IIug CMU I tried this place out rather randomly after noticing its existence near Schnucks The restaurant is a very typical eat in take out joint with a nice lady coordinating the kitchen and taking the orders As always my order was the classic American Chinese takeout standby of General Tso s Chicken The food was ready in the promised 10 minutes and I was happy to see that its container was practically bursting with chicken broccoli and fried rice A good start Once home I eagerly unloaded a mix of victuals onto a plate and began to chow down Unfortunately the experience from here on was a bit of a disappointment The meat was not at all spicy despite the cute little chili pepper next to its name on the menu and the flavor was more bitter than I m used to Maybe that s what they re shooting for but the peculiar bitter salty aftertaste didn t jibe too well with my taste buds Granted my opinion here is based entirely on one experience with one style of food That being said I ve definitely had better I ll see how the leftovers are after a night of sitting in the fridge but the next time I have a craving for the good general s fried nuggets of fowl I ll probably be looking elsewhere 
iQBol74boVVOegZ03xgCeg CMU Golden Harbor is my go to Chinese restaurant The menu is huge the restaurant is excellent for groups and it s great that they offer private parking My friends had to guide me through the ordering process where you look at the extensive menus on the wall both in English and Chinese fill out an order ticket and give to the cashier Simple My favorite dish or at least the one I keep coming back for is the crispy tofu They make both a family and lunch special portion that are priced accordingly Food is delivered to your table but you must bus your own dishes unless you want to pay extra Hot tea is free Warning this restaurant is popular so if you plan to come with a group try to come for an early dinner 
irb4XfjZ8SflWluAeVHu4Q CMU The food is good Don t get me wrong Of the three things my friends and I shared all were enjoyed But there s more to a dining experience than that First the ordering process is laughably absurd They re trying to reinvent the wheel and it s annoying If you have to have signs to explain your process it is too complicated Additionally the first time I went I waited in line for 15 minutes Because they were busy Nope One party found the directions too complicated and came up to tediously order maybe 10 entrees inquiring specifically about each one and blah blah blah I cannot recreate to you the tedium 15 minutes one group not exaggerating If you have a system even if it s stupid and someone isn t following it tell them to wait or sit down or quickly explain it to them I literally don t think I ve ever walked out of a restaurant due to frustration before but that was pretty out of hand I also found it pretty expensive and the fee to bus your tables pretty hilarious I will continue to go to lai lai instead 
iVEqbJ68mSVNnUFEoyk55Q CMU i was in town visiting some friends and we had some take out from rainbow garden the only thing that i am certain of is that this place has the most def tastiest if that s a word crab rangoon it s crispy and chewy and filled with yummy cheese next time i m in town i will be sure to stop in and eat eat eat 
IxvtdNH7iQ-YRCRo0pPd9Q CMU This place is a tad better than Mandarin Wok across the street but they don t take CREDIT CARD I don t like that They also charge more than Mandarin Wok which is ridiculous I would rather go to The Wok in Mahomet I do think they take some short cuts in their food they don t use authentic veggies all the time and the lady is not terribly friendly They do have a punch card though if you can buy 10 dishes in one month you get one for free I think 
i_nKPqrU7Vv-Qjc7juKmyw CMU The ordering process is just ridiculous I enjoyed the food when they were Mandarin Wok so we tried to eat at Golden Harbour The menu was SO EXTENSIVE as to be completely intelligible with little to no description of each dish and the ordering was so completely annoying for a party of two that just wanted to order two small entree sized portions VERY RARE thing here that we left without ordering There are a lot of options for Chinese food in this town ones with a MUCH better dining experience I have however had a few take out dishes from Golden Harbor that someone brought to a gathering and they consisted of relatively the same brown sauce with different vegetables some with mushrooms some with squash some with greens Rather ordinary nothing terribly special 
J6RrfxMPo8pJ_V6jjvn2IA CMU What is this concept of paying cash and not having to pay tax Hrm Takeaways Crispy sesame chicken covered in just the right amount of sauce as in not doused Good size Incredible price Free hot tea Bus your own plates and garbage If you need a takeout container just grab it from behind the counter No fuss No wonder Cravings is crowded and busy all of the time Warning though expect takeout and not to eat in There s also no delivery 
J73ty0FUN-xPH1yr_LK0kg CMU My mom never walked out on a restaurant until the day we stepped into Bo Bo China Bo Bo China didn t know what to do with themselves when my family and I said we DIDN T want to eat their buffet which was sad looking and we wanted to order from their regular menu We were handed some poorly copied paper menus and sat down in the pretty empty restaurant Apparently there s an unspoken rule here that you either go for the buffet or order takeout because the lack of service was offensive and we were hungry The buffet also had flies buzzing about it Never again will I come here which isn t a loss since there s another Chinese restaurant next door and one across the street What is up with this stretch of Green St in Champaign IL and their Chinese restaurants 
jg6SUSv1rZfRmD155xc4xw CMU I ve only been here once but as far as I know it s good stuff I ordered chicken and broccoli and the portions were HUGE Not to mention the dishes were served separately in three really cute bowls plates complete with crispy won tons and soup The service was also really awesome fast and it was cute because it was a mother and her two really adorable kids The only thing was that it was a bit empty in there perhaps because of the odd location I definitely will be back to hopefully give this place it s fifth star 
jiHf3agglFvSjg202SAi4g CMU Damn you Hot Wok Damn your sweet savory goodness and badness Some years back I entered college as a skinny 135lb freshman and I exited 4 years later a 180lb man I don t know if I can call it blame but Hot Wok definitely contributed to the additional 45lbs I found at beautiful U of I I also blame the all you can eat dorm food but let s just concentrate on Hot Wok for now Where else can you stop by and get a styrofoam box stuffed full of rice and your choice of some choice tasty toppings like General s Chicken Curry Chicken yada yada for only 5 And everything here tastes so good like they sprinkle bacon on everything I never came here once without ordering the General s Chicken My firstborn will either be named General s Chicken or Hot Wok or Andrew Jr one of the three but I m not sure which just yet You ll probably have leftovers so you can store the rest in your little dorm fridge but just know that whatever Hot Wok puts into the food to make it taste so good also causes the food to congeal once it gets below room temperature so you re apt to open the fridge and find something that more resembles head cheese than General s Chicken But that head cheese still tastes good cold so rejoice Also plan ahead because you ll need at least a 1 2 hour nap after each Hot Wok meal so try not to eat it right before class or while you re studying for finals Tip When your jeans begin to start fitting too tightly your freshman year don t throw them away give them to the Salvation Army 
JJmu6t5bpNvZA1FieGv6VA CMU I ve been coming here since it opened and before that I was driving to Mahomet to eat at the Wok So I am not unbiased I love this place Over 1000 meal choices and everything is translated into English from the old menu There are your normal Americanized Chinese meals like sweet and sour pork and beef and broccoli I assume they re pretty good but I m more excited about the more exotic meals I ve had three cup chicken stewed goat with skin eggplant and garlic yellow bean fish crispy tofu Peking or Fire duck peppered beef squid with garlic sauce here and salt and pepper squid I also had the soft pork buns though those may have another name now There are so many more options I ve hardly scratched the surface The Peking duck in particular is amazing fried to crispy crackly perfection and served with a thick dipping sauce It s just awesome The crispy tofu is also excellent and is served with a sweet sauce and cilantro leaves I d say it is the best in town The yellow bean fish is pretty consistently good as well The food has always been good The prices are higher than what you see at a lot of Chinese places but you get a lot of food and it is very good quality You get a big bowl of rice to eat with your food too Generally my girlfriend and I get a couple meals out of a visit here where we get two entrees and usually pay about 30 The dining room definitely does fill up especially during the school year I d give yourself some extra time to eat here especially at dinner I guess the ordering system confused some people to start with but I don t mind it They recently streamlined it too along with improving the previously kind of Spartan decor You just write down the number of people in your party and what meals you want pay and then they bring it to you Simple and easy You do have to clean up your own dishes unless you want to pay a little extra but they don t take tips so it kind of balances out This place has pretty much become my first stop for a Chinese type food craving They re friendly the options are immense and the food is very good I was able to take my sister s vegetarian boyfriend here no problem and the large sizes mean you can feed more people more affordably than if you re just going by yourself or with a date Highly recommended 
JJP5bF_o0ayrlFn_D6hRsg CMU I must have spent thousands at this place when I was attending UIUC from 2002 2006 since it was directly across from my apartment and because I was too damn lazy to cook If you are not Chinese I would definitely suggest to bring one with you to help dissect their massive Chinese written menu since it has all the goodies on there such as the oh so tender beef tendon 
Jng2LIy9aBSXgXKKv33HIQ CMU This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the Champaign Urbana area I ve been coming here ever since I landed in this town about 5 years ago and the keyword that sticks out in my mind when describing this place is consistency No matter how many times I come here the food is always delicious and never lets me down With so many different competing Chinese restaurants just in Campustown alone this place must be something special for me to say it s my favorite in the area thus proving that not all Chinese places are the same The food I feel is the most authentic Chinese food I ve had ever since moving down and also provides the best quality food comparing right on top with my other favorite Chinese restaurant back up north in the suburbs China House Schaumburg IL The food is very fresh and stands out as being the only place I ve been to on campus that doesn t come out greasy and flavor masked in an oily feeling in the mouth The flavor pops with every dish and portion size is pretty generous My favorite dish is anything from the pan fried noodle section The noodles come out perfect and as the sauce sinks in you get a nice balance of crispy and soft flavor soaked noodles It also comes with a hefty amount of vegetables bak choy is a plus and lot of protein depending on which you got I always surprise whoever I come with because they are always thrown off by the portion size which is huge Some other dishes that stand out are the Orange chicken as my friend who I brought said it was the best he had in the area Another note the wait staff is pretty on or off Usually when I go the only time I see the waiter or owner is when they bring out the food You have to get your own water tea and ask for additional items ie more rice at the counter It s not too bad since it only takes an extra second to do all that Plus it s unlimited tea and that makes up for it Overall really good Chinese food and definitely recommend this place to everybody in the area Hopefully you ll have the same experience I had 
jNKsEk3SVnierCX8C74N-A CMU ZOMG this place is a UIUC mainstay It is fairly cheap and you get lots of asian food To be fair the food can be greasy but it s college you probably get worse in the dorms Chicken Pad Thai with no egg GAME OVER HoG wins 
JYjK6KEivPMvSo_8S3pVJQ CMU I ve eaten at many Chinese places around the Champaign Urbana area and this is by far the best one I have tried Rainbow Garden is great for dining in or taking out The service is excellent and the food is always fantastic I ve tried a few different things from the menu and have thoroughly enjoyed each of them The prices are about the same as any other Chinese restaurant in the area as are the portions unless you have a large appetite one dish can usually provide two meals My only complaint is that while dining in they do not provide enough rice with their meals This isn t a problem though as they are happy to give you more upon request 
K-kPWjwHrXngeeggqohIzw CMU Although Green Street harbors a multitude of Chinese restaurants Empire is consistently one of my favorites on campus Typical menu entrees run from 5 to 10 and for the price the serving portion is respectable While I wouldn t consider the food to be jaw dropping amazing Empire definitely has great value The food is consistently great and will satisfy any quick Chinese food craving My personal favorites are the beef eggplant garlic chicken and beef green beans Atmosphere is typically quiet but because the restaurant is family operated at times the chatter among younger siblings can get noisy sometimes to the point of being an nuisance The decor is limited and gives a cheap appearance but the establishment is clean and well maintained Some things to note There is a minimum price 8 for credit cards if you want to evade a small 50 cent fee When asked between white rice or fried rice the latter is not the traditional fried rice with minced carrots corn etc it s just white rice that is lightly stir fried in some oil Tea is free Don t expect stellar English proficiency from the cashier The trays are consistently sticky Overall Empire is a great choice for those who want some fast great and cheap Chinese food 
k8CbSowxypv7a4D6PIZVoQ CMU Let me start by saying that for the first 24 years of my life I had zero experience with Chinese food My parents are meat and potatoes people and Chinese carryout was simply not a part of my upbringing Enter my Chinese American husband who grew up on the stuff naturally and can cook it like nobody s business This lengthy disclaimer is basically to tell you that I am not an educated critic of Chinese food so it s based on whether or not I liked it I have no way to judge how authentic someplace is All that said Bo Bo is pretty good It s a campus town take out type place although they do have a dining room and a few tables so you can eat there if you choose They have a very extensive menu printed in English Chinese and Korean The menu has every Chinese food item you can think of and many that you probably can t and here I am thinking specifically of a dish whose name I cannot remember at the moment involving fried pork intestines I m told it s good although my Leviticus 11 Diet prohibits me from partaking My favorite item here though is the bubble tea I don t know how they do it but they make the best bubble tea I ve had I ve tried replicating it at home and simply can t do it so much to my chagrin when I get a BTC bubble tea craving I hop in the car drive to campus finagle a parking spot feed the meter go get my bubble tea and repeat the process It s a lot of trouble to go to for bubble tea but it s THAT good I did take off a star because they don t always have the bubble tea One very busy day last month I was running errands it was cold it was rainy I was tired and all of a sudden I was siezed by a powerful BTC I was sort of near campus anyway so I drove over there finagled a parking space fed the meter went in ordered and was told that they didn t have any bubbles cooked Unfortunately I simply didn t have the time that day to wait half an hour for the bubbles to get cooked so I ordered the tea sans bubbles which was still pretty good However I was annoyed that they charged me the full price I thought I should have gotten a discount for a bubble less bubble tea but I didn t have the time or inclination to press the issue Hopefully that was just a one time occurrence and I m giving them the benefit of the doubt

KeXOVVoGqYlADCfga3LWTA CMU Another review from a few years back really sorry but wanted to make note of the places I loved when we lived in Champaign OK I read a lot of reviews a few years back when this review was current and found that people considered a place called First Wok a hidden gem Well I didn t want to drive to First Wok Then Number One Wok opened yes this review is from when this business opened I picked up their menu It was almost exactly the same as First Wok Were they related Sure looked like it Are they still No idea Anyway I found the menu amusing A lot of Chinese food menus have bad descriptions of the food and typos but this menu had NO Descriptions It was like a shot in the dark to figure out what some of the things were going to be So I gave it a try And I really liked it No I didn t order any of the standard things like sweet sour whatever or broccoli cow I randomly picked things based on the protein or noodle base or whatever caught my attention I did this four or five times before I got some favorites going By the time my favorite order was going in once a week I was very happy with my food My mother came to visit and even SHE thought it was pretty damn good FYI our background is Chinese born in Hawaii where things might not be exactly authentic but good tasting food is super important A caveat Takeout food is in a different category than sit down restaurant I am not comparing this place to the Chinese banquet restaurants That just wouldn t be fair 
kfv8y0dyHwWC_xXUGTBBTQ CMU Okay Golden Harbor is not only the best Chinese place in the area but I think it s also a contender for best restaurant PERIOD I love coming here with a bunch of people so I can try lots of different dishes I keep getting surprised by Golden Harbor and how consistently amazing it is Some of me and my husband s favorites just off the top of my head yellow bean fish crispy tofu crispy duck with dipping sauce the sauce becomes gelatinous when cooled a good thing it means they probably use some kind of stock in it three cup chicken softshell crab with hot oil and basil and meatless eggplant with house garlic sauce 
kg9BOxJp_PiYTvN24C127A CMU Another one of the great choices for Chinese food in the Champaign Urbana area I think that many times this restaurant is skipped over because their cooking is a bit lighter and prices are a bit higher than other Chinese restaurants in the area However when they do cook well their food is just as good as Lai Lai or Golden Harbor Like the other Chinese restaurants in the area it seems you should come here when they are less busy in the day so the chef has more time to concentrate on perfecting your meal That way you will get to experience all the great textures that great Chinese chefs can create 
ki91YxpsFe0VqPvrXFNYPw CMU I went to eat at this place when I was in town the traditional menu is incredible The place is small but man the food is AMAZING 
kQsx-8pGU04XGDGx3oi3Gw CMU I m not a big fan of Chinese food but my vote was unheard among the family The food over all was very unflavorful The egg drop soup had near zero taste the egg foo young was oily and the sweet and sour pork was plain no veggies fruit etc I did like the BBQ pork was good My fam thought it was too chewy but I liked it the best 
KSbx3-9UHig2Ii404l2AqA CMU Ate here with my wife and Mom while visiting a few weeks ago I live in Chicago and grew up in the suburbs with a Chinese friend so I know what good Chinese food tastes like We ordered home style tofu short ribs and orange chicken The home style tofu was perfect and had a very nice consistency while the tofu was not simply deep fried and then stir fried it was cooked properly something that many restaurants could learn from leathery tofu is no fun The short ribs were awesome Nice sauce and the meat was falling off the bone Good stuff The orange chicken was crispy and spicy and included the elusive but much wanted candied orange peel caramelized the way I like it It was nice that we could hop up and get refills on water and hot tea I ve seen few places that will do this I ve been ignored plenty while eating at Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants I don t think it s rudeness it s usually that the kitchen is busy and the restaurant is understaffed We ate late and were one of three tables Our service was prompt and good I think that sometimes you might have to get someone s attention to place an order not the end of the world by any means for me based on my experiences eating in many restaurants in Chicago We had leftovers for 2 meals to take home It s nice that the take out boxes are easy to find and are self service I hate waiting for boxes and hate even more when my food is taken back to the kitchen to be boxed leaving food behind and anyway I like to see my food while it is boxed I d give it a try if you are a student or are just in town for a few days 
kTJDs6SdYXTrNdvgx9iAvA CMU I don t know why people are hyping about the bubble tea here It s mediocre at best I came there one night for a drink and actually got food poisoning just from drinking the tea It s not a good tea when there s powder left on your tongue after you take a sip It s not a good tea when a taro tea tastes just like a coconut one and the chocolate tea tastes nothing like chocolate I m no expert on bubble tea but this has to be the worst bubble tea I have ever had in my life You could make a better one with the milk tea powder from the oriental store The taste and the disappointment I can pass but to the point that I threw up after drinking it it s just too much My group of 4 friends all had the bubble tea different flavors and all our tea tasted just that way so I know mine wasn t just a lemon We decided to throw away our drinks after trying several sips we didn t want to waste money at first but they were just beyond our tolerance I have not tasted the food there so it would not be fair if I make a judgement on the food based on the tea experience I had but just be aware of the bubble tea there And yes other reviews are right don t expect them to be nice The good thing about this place is that it might be one of the few places open around campus so close to New Year that is if you dare 
ktsGKzTesRZ6B590js1cgQ CMU This food is legit I have always ordered delivery from here I usually never have anything to complain about because Rainbow Garden is great BUT their owners managers are always so angry for some reason This is not the way to handle customer service people You can t yell at someone if they don t like the food they ordered On the plus side of that situation they gave me something else w o charge Braised chicken shrimp whateverelse protein is always good Same with the lo mein I ve had way more things there but I can t remember but it s great Try anything But the weird tofu thing it tastes like hard compressed dough that was uncooked and super dry 
kWKQOGzTWiFNP8Q-5IgSJQ CMU In trying all the Chinese restaurants on campus Empire was actually the last one we tried But boy am I glad we tried it Empire is cheap Probably the cheapest on campus especially for the quantity you get for your money Each time we order delivery it lasts at least 3 meals That said their dishes are hit and miss Some of the ones we have enjoyed immensely were Sweet and Sour Fish Fish with Garlic Sauce Eggplant with Garlic Sauce In general the Chinese menu items House Specialty Szechuan have been awesome One time though we ordered the Lemon Chicken It came in a box with lumps of fried chicken and a gelatinous yellow sauce to pour over it 
KxA6wIa4WtuN1lwym2sKVw CMU It took me a long time to get to Golden Harbor I had heard SO many varying opinions from the over the top fantastic to the somewhat mediocre I had heard about the complicated ordering system and the offering of strange meat items goat some kind of squid Well I finally went last Tuesday and WOW Here s a breakdown of the trip My friend made reservations for our group of six Our table was ready right on time and while it wasn t super crowded it seems that making a reservation for a group of more than four is a good idea We picked up our menus and a pad of receipt paper and a friend grabbed tea and cups for all The tea was fantastic The menu bewildering in the best way something can be bewildering There are SO MANY OPTIONS and so many of them sound AWESOME We ended up with six dishes to be shared family style I chose a crispy eggplant and basil dish and Mr Husband got some crispy pork We also had another eggplant dish I want to cry just thinking about it SO much scrumptious eggplant a black vinegar pork some kind of weird crab thing I don t like eating things that look like spiders so I didn t eat that and uh something else fried Our food was served surprisingly quickly considering we ordered six things It only took 10 15 minutes as I recall The conversation was amusing though so it may have taken slightly longer The eggplant dishes were like riding a dragon while eating cotton candy made from angel tears awesome I loved loved loved the crispy fried eggplant I surprised myself too in that my second favorite dish was black vinegar pork Mmm I tried everything except the spiders and I was in heaven Prices were decent Expect to pay around 10 15 per person Considering that they charge a table clearing fee and there s no expectation to leave a tip that s pretty decent Consider going elsewhere you might only spend 6 8 per person on an entree but then you add a drink and have to tip 20 at the end The total trip cost me 25 for 2 dishes which I was pleased with Bottom line for the tl dr crowd Awesome food not too expensive go with a group make a reservation drink tea don t eat spider crabs 
Ky_9OgjdxKyh0m6_xeUcyQ CMU I realized I write reviews mostly when a restaurant shows itself to be subpar as it is often the case avoid places like B Won Great Impasta or Manolos to pick three like the plague while you still have your health So I think it fair to also mention something that impressed me nicely Lai Lai is one of the best ratio price quality deals in campustown and the greater area Food which is affordable generous well cooked tasty Portions which are plentiful with good quality ingredients fresh vegetables big never suspicious shrimp etc The owner is a refined yet not pretentious woman who is kind to her customers and explains whatever you need to know As opposed to other restaurants Mandarin Wok e g the American ized menu is not really worse than the Chinese menu just a tad adapted with sweeter sauces and such Even dishes which you can find everywhere e g Kung Pao shrimp simply taste better at Lai Lai Frankly I like to order from both menus depending upon the disposition The Chinese menu has a more natural homey array of dishes I really hope Lai Lai will survive in times of economic crises not even off campus Peking Garden Rainbow Garden Tang Dinasty Chinese restaurants offer better food AND they are more expensive ADDED Golden Harbor is the only serious competition food can be even better in fact but at twice the price I like BOTH If you try Lai Lai more than once you will inevitably find your favorite dish es there and go back for more 
l2UWtvka65TlLgTkOj7aEw CMU If you like really bad generic Americanized Chinese Food this place is for you After my first order from this place I wouldn t dare order again I got the Double Sauteed Pork with Fried Rice For one there were more vegetables than meat which isn t always a bad thing if the vegetables are good enough to want to eat but these vegetables were the run of the mill cabbage bamboo shoot water chestnut and sliced carrot medley that they probably stick in every dish they make Sprinkled between the overly large vegetable pieces were slim strips of pork that were barely seasoned and covered with again the run of the mill brown gravy that they probably smother every beef or pork dish they make the worst part of which was that it was bland and tasted vaguely of corn starch thickened soy And last but not least the dish came with a choice of white or fried rice I opted for the fried rice which looked and tasted almost identical to what I imagine their white rice would have tasted like except that it was tinged yellow It looked like the stuff that comes out of a box of Uncle Ben s except I d pay for Uncle Ben s I can t believe there are so many positive reviews of this place Granted there aren t very many good 4 star worthy places on Green St but I m led to believe that most of these people have never had really good Chinese food and stick to their staples of Orange or General Tso s chicken or some variation on fried chicken bits in a sweet sauce If you re looking for a good place near Green St try Evo s on Sixth south of Green or if you re willing to walk the extra six or so blocks head over to Golden Wok on University and Fourth Never ordering from this place again 
l3aoH89HHpt1Y3-r9IqfSw CMU This is the best Chinese in campus town Some dishes are not as good as others such as eggplant and spinach I recommend the crispy tofu 
L46vSnElSNE6m_TsYt2v4A CMU Location Location Location This place suffers because its in the tomb known as Lincoln Square If you are lucky enough to have a seat where you can see the mall activity it will be homeless men mall walkers health insurance mega corporation employees and an occasional congressman When you add to that the fact that the service is horrible the decor dingy and the food sub par you get two stars from me This community hosts the nation s public university with the largest enrollment of Asian students over 6 500 Chinese and Koreans So we know and respect good Asian food This is not good Its oily trite and nothing unique about it Getting a pair of chopsticks in this place is more difficult than asking for them in McDonalds I am only refraining for one starring them because the food improved the most recent time I was there and I have hope for the future Avoid the Twice Cooked Pork because it is white and steamed instead of the dark sliced pork typical of the dish Avoid the fried rice because it is just white steamed rice with soy sauce and grease poured on it 
L5ohI-66J8oeMCnS4i2hCw CMU Peking Garden is a delightful locale and definitely one to visit as an ironic hipster in graduate school The decorations are garish the food is authentic in that way that Chinese food is translated for Middle America I found myself Peking Garden celebrating a friends completion of his prelims Nate decided that he was going to have a Mai Tai and it came in a disturbing Fu Manchu mug complete with exaggerated Asian features I was horrified and delighted simultaneously But not as delighted as when my friend Emily and I orderd the Hawaii Love Bowl a gigantic bowl of alcohol filled with cherries and anchored in the center by a small well of rum SET ON FIRE Hells yes Because nothing says I ve just moved to a small Midwest college town like Let s consume the flaming jungle juice of the gods ladies and gentlemen The food was good although I found my shrimp fried rice as boring as it sounds That was my fault for ordering it not theirs for making it I sampled everyone else s dishes however and they were quite tasty And when my uppity friend Myra bellowed that she didn t like our fortunes they gave us brand new fortune cookies Except the second time my fortune was blank Please Jesus tell me that doesn t mean I m going to die from drinking the Hawaii Love Bowl 
L9Cb3gYS152qX_bfcZDkMA CMU Quite possibly the best Chinese Restaurant in Champaign The lady who takes your order is probably the hardest working lady on campus Food is always quickly prepared and is completely tasty Every time I go back to campus I always go straight for the Lai Lai 
ldctXfdhBiXksn9AEYJNaw CMU Cravings is hands down my favorite Chinese place on campus While it is typically heavily crowded during peak lunch dinner hours the food is great and definitely worth what you pay for Portions are generous and the seasoning is not overdone as opposed to many other Chinese food places which flood their dishes in sauce My personal favorites are the Jakarta fried rice braised beef noodle bowl and hot n spicy chicken 
LFhJHuRQL9Y4qUghNeo0KA CMU This is the only place in town that I know of where you can order goat with the skin on and goat intestines Other reviewers have commented on the lack of oxygen in the place I m not sure that matters all that much If you re looking for goat this is definitely the place to go 
lM8yMaGNaw_4nEmVWjw8tA CMU This is the best tasting chinese food I ve had here Lai Lai is still on the list to try and Cravings is one of my favorites This brings me back to the good ole days when they ran Mandarin Wok Self service so it operates a little differently than what most people are used to Food was top notch served family style and reasonably priced 
LNJjNknh8UvoqcLUTGADgg CMU Hands down this is the best Chinese restaurant in Chambana Lai Lai is relatively new but customers keep coming back for its authentic fares The menu has two sides One is in English only while the other is bilingual The bilingual menu is the authentic one and note that the price is a little higher as well The dish is huge though usually enough to feed two or even three if you don t eat a lot So it evens out about the same price as other restaurants Do try the salt and pepper tofu and squid it s my favorite If fear factor is your passion they serve innards too Their crispy intestines are wonderful the perfect dish to end your date or not 
lPAMFL-2aicuM4I4CBLgAw CMU For fast food Chinese it s pretty good They have great sesame chicken and the owner is a wonderful man Not 4 star Chinese if you are wanting sit down restaurant quality But it s the best fast food Chinese around 
lPjsjz2dMDNn7fSMLVNvvg CMU The BEST Chinese food I have had in the United States in a long time I love Asian food but typically avoid Chinese restaurants due to the typical tired Americanized fare The flavors at Golden Harbor are very authentic just like dishes I had in Taiwan and China Shanghai Suzhou Hangzhou and Beijing in spring 2011 I m already trying to think of an excuse to return to Champaign Try the crispy tofu eggplant with garlic sauce and spicy fried green beans 
lVKVHtqIuaIALIGJdy8XCQ CMU I love this place for take out Chinese I tend to get the sesame chicken combo and fried wontons which are both very good When I get other things I am happy with the food I use to go to First Wok all the time because I lived near it but now I am far away from it and find that this place is just as good if not better They are always very pleasant quick and I find the prices very reasonable 
lVzAHapUElRJ2A4lhZyh2A CMU My previous experiences at Empire have been pretty good This time I ordered their recommendation of curry chicken and I was not a fan It s still a good amount of food for the money Like most chinese fast food places if you re dining in you get free refills on your rice There s free Tea I have to put ice in it cause it s usually burning One recommendation I would have is that you do not try Indian food at a Chinese Restaurant Even Cravings on Wright which is usually pretty good is pretty terrible with their version of Indian food 
lYV574QNdRfr2m3yttxWww CMU I ve heard lots of praise about this place but frankly I didn t care too much for Lai Lai Wok at all and I love Chinese food The place seems to get pretty packed and there is not much room inside so I would expect a wait if you go during peak hours and want to eat in The service was OK but the workers had a hard time speaking English so I didn t know if my order was being taken correctly and they had a really hard time explaining to me what certain dishes were The food was ok Nothing terribly wrong with it but I guess it did not just suit my fancy I disliked the taste of the sauce used in the entrees It had a very ketchup hot sauce type of taste to it My parties entrees had similar sauces Some people might like this type of sauce but I dislike it strongly The prices are good and you get a good sized portion of food It s not a bad restaurant by any means I just don t prefer their recipes I will be sticking with Golden Harbor UPDATE Forgot to mention they DON T take credit cards A bit disappointing since we live in 2011 
m4vGcaaCsUxs-cFCTp0aMQ CMU I love eating at Golden Harbor The owners of this place used to own Mandarin Wok and Cravings They have also owned restaurants in Taiwan as well so I always come here when I need a taste of home When I first walked in I was overwhelmed by the extensive Chinese menu that is plastered on the wall There are so many dishes to choose from There is also an English menu as well The entrees are pretty pricey but you get a large portion I recommend bringing friends to split the bill so you can try more dishes Things to try crispy tofu sacha lamb three cup chicken hou fun taiwanese pork soup forgot the actual name Overall great authentic Taiwanese food A must try 
M9kUGDmM2qta88eOCKMO_Q CMU I recently got this for delivery which was very quick Most of the food was good but I was not a fan of the amount of breading on the Orange Chicken That just means I will order something different as the Shimp dish that my hubby got was really good I have had other things from here previously that I also really enjoyed The prices are reasonable and the delivery charge is understandable Also the fact that they have Online Ordering now is a big plus I will definitely be ordering from them again 
mA7cMWBBPaEmgME19sC5sw CMU I ve never had the food here but the smoothies are tops The cappuccino is my favorite and though I LOVE tapioca in my smoothies this is one time I ll skip it just because it distracts me from how amazing the flavor is I always order before I see the sign near the counter advertising peppermint It sounds pretty bizarre but still I m intrigued 
mAKdKho2hFOXH9-KAWKGEg CMU Why do all fast Chinese joints have the same exact menu Seriously It s the placemat sized paper one Red and black meal specials and the same food You know what I m talkin bout right Everywhere across the nation My Tso s Chicken here was sub par Especially biting the nugget in half and realizing there was a microscopic shred literally a shred of actual chicken surrounded by two inches of chicken flavored dough Yikes That being said all the vegetarian meals ordered were pretty tasty Special request Tso s Tofu looked rockin and tasted better The Ma Po Tofu was a bit on the slimy side and our party noticed some flavor balance issues in certain dishes It s very basic american ized Chinese food fairly cheap and large portions hella quick 
MCHT3jh209YQmTQ0Sd-sfw CMU Great Chinese Yum o Service was a little dicey which is why I didn t give it a 5 just a little understaffed Well priced and well selected menu We had Kung Pao Chicken and Salted and Pepper Chicken Both were good but the Kung Pao was better S P Chicken was like a Chinese fried chicken but it wasn t greasy or anything Good stuff 
McqE9ztmOsO5XJPKjKRGSw CMU This is my favorite Chinese place down here They have countless options and their menu is large seeing that it spreads across half the damn store I am a fan of their authentic Chinese food but their non traditional Chinese food is even better and this is the only place in Urbana Champaign that reminds me of Chinese restaurants in Chicago And that s a good thing for HOG Their fried rice is amazing as always I usually get the Shrimp or Combination and the entire staff there is friendly Gotta love this place If you haven t visited it yet you should 
mFCUzbfuQDjq7u2o-Tsb2Q CMU Fine dining No Good hearty Americanized Chinese food Yes I ve always had excellent food and service at China Garden The location next to Schnuck s is super convenient easy to stop by on the way home or for a quick run on weekends I almost always get mine to go which must be the case for most of their business Food is cooked to order and is super fast about 10 min Portions are large I get two meals from a single order Unlike many Chinese restaurants the flavor of the food isn t overwhelmed by generic seasoning or MSG The egg drop soup the large is a quart has nursed me through many colds and it s ridiculously cheap I appreciate their vegetarian options and they ve always accommodated special requests Their vegetarian spring rolls are gigantic It s Chinese fast food but it s fresh tasty and a bargain 
MfLFUTDwP323615xYyfg-Q CMU Really the best pad thai in champaign It took me awhile to find a place with Pad Thai that looked like it was supposed to and this was the place Their food is delicious and the owner is super friendly I had some of their other noodle soups and it was fantastic I have nothing to complain about This was the place I ve been looking for since I came here for school This is what i miss I miss REAL Thai and Chinese food and Golden Wok is excellent 
mjs0aq3Xs6pz3bzNmCLkzQ CMU This place had generally good reviews but I had an entirely different experience It was a very disappointing A friend and I had decided to go because we wanted to try their dim sum I had heard from friends that it was great We walked in about 12 15 and did not leave until about 2 30 In my opinion that is way too long for an hour lunch break We walked in and it was very hectic The waitresses were yelling and the tables were still dirty from the customers who had left We went up to the counter to order but she told us to sit down with our menu We saw a bunch of people walk in and order at the counter so we filled in our sheet and brought it up At this point it was about 12 30 before she even took our sheet because the waitress were taking care of the customers who had just walked in So we sat there and waited and waited and waited 30 minutes had gone by and nothing 40 minutes Nothing We were very upset because we only had a short lunch break About 43 minutes later our first dish came out Slowly our little dim sum dishes came out One by One Our dishes were being thrown on the table without care and the waitress just left without telling us what it was We went up to get some hot tea as well and both containers were completely empty We to complain and the manager said that this was a new girl and she didn t really have a handle on things yet Our last dish came about 45 minutes later from our first dish A few of the dim sum dishes were really tasty but it did not make up for lack of management and service skill I do not think that I ll ever be returning 
MkTO3Yrh9at1IQLXkI4y0w CMU We had originally planned on eating at Golden Harbor even though we weren t exactly satisfied with our food our first trip there They were packed and lucky for me my husband agreed to try this place rather than a Chinese Buffet blech We soooo over ordered We started with Sechuan Wontons which were tasty and inexpensive I ordered Basil Chicken labeled spicy and loved it although there was no heat My husband ordered General Shrimp which was the best General anything Chinese I ve had He also had Beef Lo Mein that was pretty tasty The prices seem high but when you see the portions they are quite fair We have at least two meals each to take home with us I m very pleased with the friendly service and the fact that 42 66 bought us 6 meals total So good 
mLCguZ-k6phSgse4_bRPxw CMU I love the food but the staff are always impatient as if we were not their customers but some strangers that disturbed them when they were busy with their work I d go for the Szechuan food and bubble tea only if I have a crave for them because this place is too expensive for me I spend over 15 every time I eat there with almost no leftovers 
MMVo213rpD5Ng__XKtejcQ CMU OK First I need to say that I m not a Chinese food fan But I like some kinds of it Ambient of this restaurant is very bad There is always a smell and smoke inside Because of that you may start coughing This is a very bad thing Food is OK But I had better experiences about Chinese restaurants so this is not my first option in C U And price is reasonable actually cheap However service is so slow So many people order by phone before they re coming to this restaurant To sum up if you wanna have a Chinese food Cravings wouldn t be your first option as long as you re not specifically try the food of South China I recommend Evo in C U area 
MNm9zWyysOVpHINMpre8Cw CMU A bit austere but your money is spent on the food not decor I ordered several authentic mapo doufo and yangzhou chao fan and americanized general tso chicken dishes and all were very good overall a tasty experience you have to write your own guest check and hand it to the cashier prepaying for your meal 
MOD31c6hvfCgPVwSO7jV7Q CMU This isn t the worst place for pad Thai and trust me I ve been almost everywhere in town for it My biggest complaint is this place is so dirty I was afraid to drink the water but thats just me However their Thai iced tea is pretty good I can t say that I would go here again but it was worth a try Also this place is pretty cheap around 8 or so 
MWFvboPk302sYpfRk2N2rg CMU I don t usually review boring Chinese places but well here I am Empire is my go to place for cheap Chinese food The food is good enough and the price is low I don t go here expecting a great meal I go here when I m hungry and want something Chinese that is good enough to make my tummy happy 
mx4qX2_-OMQFPJG3mWFiKg CMU This place is still my favorite pad thai place It s got some flavors in there that I feel that other Thai places are lacking But let s talk about the duck fried rice Though I do like the pad thai more than the duck fried rice I feel that this deserves some special mentioning It is delicious and is one of the best fried rice dishes that I ve ever had They pretty much took the chopped up roast duck that you d typically find at Chinese stores and made fried rice with it All the duck grease melds with the rice and it is awesome Oh yeah being chopped up means that there s bone in there too to be careful about that Regardless this is yet another must visit if you re in this area 
MyuOJIE6N_FKcWb4MG8ZZg CMU I was very excited when I saw that a new Chinese place was open and that it is open really late Then once I saw their menu and saw that they have a tofu general tso s I had to try it So I did and it wasn t all that great I am not sure how other general tso s are but this one didn t have any broccoli at the bottom like other ones that I ve had and the tofu was ehhh Some pieces had a really good crisp to them and others were tough and chewy The food is reasonably priced and you get a ton but stay away from the tofu general tso s unless you really really like tough and chewy tofu and rice I know I will next time Oh but one thing they do get points for is if you pay with cash you get a 3 discount even on delivery 
nAsEHVYLjhJfVUPTpGMN6g CMU This is hands down the best chinese food in central Illinois Another reviewer put it very succinctly though you go for the food and not the atmosphere If you want to be pampered go somewhere else If you want tasty authentic chinese eat here Other reviewers have complained about the notepad ordering system and it s really not my favorite system either On the other hand folks who knew them from The Wok in Mahomet who don t read chinese will appreciate the fact that the full menu is now available in English One of those reviewers was perplexed about how to order a dish not so spicey but it worked great for us simply to write EXTRA SPICEY next to one dish and NOT SPICEY next to another I feel more confident writing NOT SPICEY on the pad of paper than I do saying it I ve had dinner there two nights in a row and still find myself craving it for dinner tonight My partner went for lunch yesterday and met me there again for dinner we may have to consider just moving in I had the crispy tofu which has been an absolutely favorite from the Wok in Mahomet and my new favorite is the Snow Pea Leaves with Garlic I was blown away by how tasty and fresh this dish tastes My partner had the Cilantro Pork on Noodle and loved it The dumplings were awesome and I like the vegetable egg rolls better than the regular egg rolls The counter staff are extremely friendly and helpful When I placed an order for a dish from the Diced Chicken W Bone she made sure I knew that the dish I was ordering was chicken ON the bone She also remembered us from the Mahomet restaurant and remembered to leave the onions out of my partner s dish I was also surprised by the dollar charge to clear your table at the Mahomet restaurant I always cleared my plates away and they wiped down the tables Frankly the prices are so good I don t mind paying an extra buck So this restaurant is ideal for me great food no frills on the setting or service and lower prices If they had full waiter service there would be longer waits for tables and the prices would have to be much higher I d rather save the money and eat there more often 
nCkGQ51yMFfQ3DeiaS774A CMU Best Chinese Food on Campus I wish they were open late and had delivery but they already have enough loyal Lai Lai fans ordering takeout and sitting in to keep them busy I must comment about how fast their takeout time is I call put in my order they tell me 5 10 min usually 5 mins I leave my house and my hot delicious is waiting for me on the counter Great My favorite Lai Lai Wok dishes that will never disappoint my hungry stomach 1 Crispy Tofu 2 Empress Chicken 3 Shrimp in Lobster Sauce 4 Mongolian Beef 
NDK0cAchIl5vg7Anzdxzbw CMU Easily the best Chinese restaurant in central Illinois Food here is beyond phenomenal Most dishes are as authentic as it gets outside China itself and even American favorites like sesame chicken taste quasi genuine rich in the flavor of natural chicken not of heavy artificial sauces Golden Harbor has no waiter service and the decor is rather nondescript but I think that s a plus as it contributes to the hole in the wall local traditional feel of the restaurant which since its days as the Wok in Mahomet has actually received many technological upgrades 
ng9QY9ZIYCQDm8KwTIFkxg CMU All of my Chinese friends rave about this place I went here and while the price is a little more than your average Chinese restaurant on campus the food is top notch The best tasting Chinese food on campus bar none The portions are huge too 
NGkf4_25oAiNm8GwCJyzaQ CMU I come here for lunch occasionally and the food is pretty decent 
NkjyJkZi_Qy9TyZPwdzaEw CMU When they were under previous management their food was great But now it s barely passable Their fried rice is all gummy and their noodle soups are too salty Do yourself a favor and go to the old owners new place the Wok in Mahomet 
NKs61AmkYFlbWY77VO6d6w CMU Outstanding Chinese in the wasteland of central Illinois Get the salt and pepper chicken This place appears to be hardcore no whities while I dined The menu has a special section only in Chinese Strange sign on the wall says Please clean your table for the next customer 
nMapTe1YLlijKTe7Su4A6g CMU Well their sign says it all No 1 wok as in No don t bother trying it I ordered a combination plate and asked for fried rice but got white the egg role was terribly overdone and the sweet and sour chicken was just ok For the price I would go to a few other places in Champaign Urbana and get much better quality 
NphGvZzP09bEUwJYrLpGxQ CMU This is the place to go for cheap Chinese food in campustown The food is not fancy but will fill you up when you re hungry My personal favorite is their spicy fish filet 
nQUJiTdxtlMUc3h25y3XkA CMU The sczechan chicken was too spicy But the egg roll and pad Thai tasted fine 
nvwN3nIiMvZZxQJ545ON4g CMU Some lame person flagged my review and it got pulled Take 2 Don t let the authentic Chinese in the title fool you The standout food at Golden Harbor is authentic homestyle Taiwanese dishes Also for those who are interested this is the rough history of the owners time in the area Pre 2000 2004 Mandarin Wok 2005 Cravings Drastically different from its current state early 2010 The Wok in Mahomet Mid 2010 Golden Harbor I m in the area approximately once an year and this is on my must try list along with Jarling s Custard Cup I left the area in 2005 and the owner still recognizes me Ask all the alumni that have passed through the doors of the original Mandarin Wok and they ll tell you in all of their worldly travels they haven t found a crispy tofu as good as the one here Go easy on the service and ambience the food is worth it A friend made reservations for me since it sometimes gets busy You get a table and look for your table on arrival and use it to place your order With each order you get a big bowl of rice based on the number of diners plates fortune cookies and chopsticks I think the prices may have gone up over the years but I guess certain items are harder to come by in Champaign The overwhelming Chinese menu on the wall is supposedly fully translated into English look for the menus on the lefthand side I m not sure how complete the translated menu is And for those who prefer Chinese American takeout food I believe those items are still available You don t have to tip because you re expected to clean up your own table My order 809 Crispy tofu let me know if you figure out the recipe to the sauce 204 Spicy basil chicken balls 876 Chinese cabbage gotta have some veggies 2000 Chicken rolls 
nvYYO_FuTqciW_WerBaafA CMU I keep hearing how good this place is and I finally checked it out I was not disappointed I read a lot of reviews about the ordering process and how it was confusing I think they must have heard because when we went it was really clear how to do it and I found it very easy They have a big sign with instructions and instructions inside the menus also To be clear you go in the door there are menus the American and the translated You take an order pad and a pen write down the number of what you want take it to the counter and pay They give you a number then bring the food to your table After you pay there is a table with flatware for you to grab They bring your plates napkins and chopsticks to the table for you Simple and easy The translated menu has SO many choices I didn t know what to order so I went with the standard General s chicken and my hubby got the Schezwan chicken We split the pork filled pot stickers Everything was amazing just amazing Best Chinese food I have ever had I think next time we go I d like to have my Chinese friend order for us I think that d be a lot more fun and I d get to try more authentic foods since everyone has been raving about them I think he d choose a lot of different and tasty stuff besides the Americanized dishes We got there a bit after 5 Around 5 30 it was like the flood gates opened at it was PACKED it was a Saturday There are a lot of tables It s good for groups too because they have a lot of big round tables with the lazy Susan in the middle for sharing and passing different dishes I can t wait to go again at least I have plenty of leftovers to last a while The portions are generous Top notch 
o-SPH6Fu8-qflKIyZIJqHw CMU One of my favorite Chinese joints in college Portions are huge so large that I think 2 people can finish one lunch item The menu has so many varieties of foods I love the fried rice here The staff is nice and they have a lot of seating to accommodate a large group Very inexpensive and I highly recommend it 
O-vtapiBEY1kCjDd9rWp1w CMU Very tasty food from vegetarian perspective Loved their home style tofu and egg plant Atmosphere was nice The owner was very friendly I m definitely coming back 
o0oSEa9N5egRlnM-ReEUxQ CMU Cheaper than Golden Harbor Probably not quite as good of food though I ve had beef tendon spicy chicken with peanuts baby bok choy and eggplant with pork All were good The tea tasted soapy to me but it could just be more floral than I used to Service is not the best 
obeMuobLrRrSocJKdu-Iyg CMU Well since my last review was flagged I ll have to start this one again Previous post was to confirm the restaurant is indeed Tina s which was in question before she actually opened Tina s new place is at the site of the old Pickles restaurant on Green St She thankfully gutted most of the restaurant needed it ages ago and it is now very open There are numerous tables for Chinese Family Style eating lazy susan in the middle of the table for food along with standard tables 4 seaters So this is a larger restaurant by Tina s standards larger than Mandarin Wok s total seating She has Tea Pots for tables now and a large tea making machine A great addition to the restaurant There s now enough space for the chinese menu out front and also the buffet table only used during moon festival I think Unfortunately I removed one star from the 5 for two things which together I felt were slightly important to new visitors half star The new system of computer ordering from front to back of house is a bit frustrating for old customers of the Woks You are presented with a pad of paper and a pen and instructed to place your table number and number of party on the pad You then write down the numbers of items you wish to order When you get to the front all of this goes into the computer and zipped back to the cooks by electrical magic This is significantly faster than the older method of ordering but much less personable One of the golden linings of Tina s restaurants is actually Tina herself she knows her menu and she wields it well So if you aren t sure what to order you re in a bit of a bind with the new system Now this was the first week so it all might calm down in a week or two Incidentally some of the items on the menu are actually mistranslated The items we had and love are 204 Spicy Basil Chicken mislabeled on the menu 851 Garlic Stir Fried Green Beans The final half star off is for a slight difference in flavor in the 204 I don t know what it is hard to put my finger on it I think it s due to new equipment but it s ever so slightly different at least when I had it I m definitely tempted to to give Tina 5 stars as I can t express how happy I am I can eat her food again but I feel for those who are going to go to her new place for the first time those two aspects may make a difference I hope to be back with more numbers to add to the list of dishes we really love I ll reconsider the last star as we go more often I suspect the first week will always be a bit rough around the edges Definitely a place to recommend to everyone interested in Taiwanese food Addendum we came for dinner the night before but had to leave as there were no tables to be had and a 1 hour wait for food We came back the next day for lunch and it was much better 
oiV3Q0IX-kQfYZAeU-zcww CMU YUMMY I love this place large enough to hold 17 girls for a big dinner party in the other room Crispy tofu and eggplant were the highlights of the night Ended up being 8 pp What a deal 
on6OOgDgyfUAPXcWCvjGZQ CMU Really great lunch menu I had the orange chicken and it was very good I love their fried rice rice egg carrots and peas Their crab rangoons actually contained crab or krab not sure but there was real protein in them The lunch menu is really filling and reasonably priced 5 95 for orange chicken fried rice soup and an egg roll The decor is really pretty and the wait staff was very friendly and knowledgable I really recommend this place 
p648m58gqMCHvhjcoUr0dQ CMU When this place first opened up I was confused because there are already like half a dozen Chinese restaurants on or around the U of I campus So I wondered how they would be able to compete Here s how They deliver and they deliver late If you want food at like 1 am they ll bring it to you I don t think any of the other ones do And this place has cheap prices for pretty decent food It s not like authentic authentic but it gets the job done And it s still more Chinese than panda express I always get the crab ragoons I like how it s not traditional and they roll them differently And the beef and broccoli is always a good choice pay cash and they give you like a 30 cent discount too 
p67T2WDnpmf12Q3r_D7hnw CMU not the best chinese restaurant around HOWEVER unbelievable bang for your buck make no mistake people this really is as good as it gets chicken fried rice 4 73 cash 4 98 card those numbers should tell you that i go to this place like its selling grades hot and spicy chicken 6 99 apparently it s the best seller The reason i quote the prices is to tell you that you re getting an incredible amount of food for the cheapest price on campus You can actually make two meals out of those 6 99 deals there s plenty of em chicken with chilli bean sauce is pretty good 
PB87w-QNhybcIFnGEGIayA CMU I really think this is some of the best Chinese food in Champaign I was an Empire fan for the longest but one dish from Number one Wok is definitely more savory than Empire or Evo in comparison They are a little heavy on their pork inclusions to fried rice and egg rolls but I enjoy swine so the more for me 
Pdzkt-RjOQ6KCk7eNi7OSg CMU Yes the incredible number of choices can be daunting but oh the fun you will have trying things out Food comes out straight from the stove be careful with that first bite and is well worth the wait One of the reviewers mentioned a review in the Champaign Taste blog that might give you ideas of what to order Another blogger has been posting pictures and descriptions at http goldenharborchineserestaurant blogspot com I was inspired by one the pictures to order 896 Snow pea leaves with King Mushrooms which included the greens and two kinds of thinly sliced mushrooms in a savory brown sauce with lots of whole garlic cloves Wow In Hawaii we would say broke da mouth A warning we arrived at 5 30 PM on a Saturday and a lot of the tables were already reserved which meant not a lot of tables left for walk ins If you have a party of more than 2 4 you might want to call ahead on a weekend Even if you have to wait it will be well worth it 
peNmlAoaws6gBzbkVv_xNQ CMU Great place for excellent Chinese Food that is thick with cornstarch saturated in MSG but so damn delicious all at the same time Decor is modest and the corner location is a great view The large windows and elevated height make it a great place to eat Chinese food while watching people cross streets I had the Mapo Tofu which was delicious The flavor of the sauce was authentic and earthy If you want a Chinese restaurant that is reliable than Lai Lai Wok is the place to eat 
Ph-Th2N7_GmCIRm9vgg5TQ CMU Nice sit down Chinese place What else is there to say 
PL7JZoD8eGmxilnrRzrMug CMU Coming from the northeast I ve definitely lowered my standard for Chinese food so I ll admit this isn t the best food around What I will say is that their service is amazing and since they are the only late night Chinese restaurant around especially with delivery when it s necessary they are tops I ve come to realize it s acutally pretty decent food You can t go wrong with General Tso s or Orange Chicken My friend likes their fried dumplings and their Wonton Soup is good What you ll notice is every time you come in regardless of it s your first or second time they ll always greet you with a smile and take care of you There s a sweet girl who works in there who I swear must be on pills because she is always happy and super nice to you It s mainly a take out and delivery place but you can eat there When you eat there they ll serve you water and bring you napkins and such but it s not really an eat in place There s a 3 discount if you pay cash Being on a college campus we all get interesting cravings for interesting things throughout the night Chopstix is currently the only restaurant I know of that does both take out and delivery until at least 3 00am By the way delivery is relatively quick Just try it out it s pretty good 
PlyaAYSMq2Ne5MS0lOkGTw CMU For a place that looks like a Greyhound bus station it s pretty good Not going to lie it s not fancy looking by any means and they seriously need new menus I had to sift through 5 menus to find out that it was one big menu just torn apart AND THE EFFING WATER I know it s free but it seriously takes forever for the water to come out of the fountain dispenser I wanted to get Sprite not because I really wanted it but because I knew I would ve gotten it quicker But hey I like free stuff including free water However the cashier was super friendly and knowledgeable she recc d the fried tofu which was AMAZING There s a reason why everyone raves about it I got fried rice which was simply delish it had the right amount of rice and meats the soy sauce was nicely balanced For a large plate it was worth 10 99 This place is pretty legit 
pMhdSlfV95OS0KGrbX_PWA CMU It is not one of the best Chinese restaurant in Champaign it is the best 
ptpvs9CWieIJ-DwFe5KaRg CMU Seems like they have all the food that every other Chinese restaurants has But this place must really care more I have ate at others and so far none have been able to match the quality of the food Be ready for a HOT meal I have never had a cold one at this restaurant It must be family owned as I always see the husband wife two daughters and the same cook in there 
PvewRJn9LyGkYfSqMq9orw CMU unauthentic chinese food I wonder why so many of my friends like to go there so I have to go with them dim sum bad dishes I ve tried ok but no authentic But there is one thing that I LOVE PHO But sometimes it tastes too sweet I m wondering if they really put a lot of sugar in pho I m starting to miss the pho I had in Chicago and NYC 
PVmnjiWb1qbihF4a1CJ_hQ CMU Ever since I went to Hong Kong I have been a huge fan of Dim Sum Unfortunately there are not a lot of places to get it in central Illinois but this is one of them if not the only one and it is also surprisingly pretty darn good Now I have been working on my Cantonese but it s not great so I will explain my favorite dishes using my lame english terms 1 Pork Dumplings good not really unique or anything pretty standard for dim sum 2 Sesame rolls AWESOME I am usually not a huge fan of these but theirs are pretty decent and sweeter than I remember 3 shrimp crepes pretty good I would have liked more shrimp though 4 chicken feet cooked really well these were pretty big and more filling then I think is typical 5 Spare Ribs they came in a sauce that I can t really remember the name of but it was good and not too salty 6 Turnip Cake probably my favorite but I always love it 7 Congee this came with a pork sausage which was tasty I was getting pretty full at this point but the congee was good enough to keep me going The place also has really good jasmine and chrysanthemum tea which is refreshing on a chilly day The only thing I wish they did here was use the carts but it is a small place and they serve other items then Dim Sum so I understand 
q-rc3WbaBM8JMmqJpubboQ CMU Ever since they changed owners it just hasn t been the same Sure they amped up the decor and furniture and the nicest part is that they take credit card not like Lai Lai across the street but the food really doesn t cut it What I mean is they have started taking short cuts in order to boost their profits I ordered fried tofu which used to be good but they used old expired tofu That s gross If you must eat here I would get the Singaporean rice noodles 7 for a huge plate or the dimsum The dimsum dishes are okay they are really just frozen that they heat up for you If you want the old Mandarin Wok quality I would HIGHLY recommend going to the Wok in Mahomet it s like a five minute drive on 74 W 
q3PyGdlQLo8E9suhYl93qA CMU The below poster was correct there are really three menus here Stick to the Chinese one and avoid disappointment The food from that menu is authentic and if that were the only menu this restaurant had it would receive four stars Unfortunately the review of that menu must be balanced by the much poorer Americanized Chinese food they serve If you want something small to try order a steamed pork bun and a glass of warm soy milk It s a cheap classic snack 
Q3s4He0x992gVWFUKJXP3w CMU There are so many chinese restaurants on campus If not this place is one of the closest to campus I would not go again Simply just because I never crave for the food there The food is ok I just like food from other chinese places better 
qaBO33Sj5UO9G3PYzk5FlQ CMU I saw that Rainbow Garden offered Korean Chinese food so I thought I would give them a shot I ordered a jajangmyeon and tangsuyuk for takeout Prices were comparable to what I would pay back home near Chicago The portions were pretty decent as well Taste wise the jajangmyeon was good but not as good as back home There were lots of pieces of seafood and meat in the sauce although it was a bit greasy Another reviewer mentioned that they serve pickled radish along with the jajangmyeon when you dine in they seemed to omit this with my takeout order Not a deal breaker or anything but little details like this which would gain them another star The tangsuyuk was nicely fried and cripsy The sauce was a great balance of sweet and sour and overall it was a solid dish I ll be coming back to Rainbow Garden in the future when I m craving Korean Chinese food 
QaG1m2KKSSN3LpqnSmyDkQ CMU Best General Tso s chicken I have ever had and I m Chinese Granted it s not really an authentic Chinese dish but this place makes it damn good and it s cheap But man is it spicy One of the best fast food Chinese places I ve ever eaten at Definitely go here when you have the hankering for Chinese
